I wondered if they were hungry."

Naturally, not everyone in our families approve of our lifestyles, but the ones who count most, our parents, back us all to the hilt. Especially Jacky’s mom. She keeps asking when she’s gonna get to be a grandma.
Anyways, as I came up, the girls were clowning around out front. Laverne was leaning her back against the bricks wearing her desert-sand colored jumpsuit and jacket with hearts and polka dots pattern. It was almost a desert camo, and it fit all her courses very nicely.
She kept her black hair short at the bangs, almost to the bottom of her ears, so they peek-a-poo-ed at the side, and collar length at the back. She wore very little makeup, and that was only for work at the office. At home, she and Jacky wore none. As a matter of fact, Jacky hated makeup and wore none at all ever. She hated for reasons unknown to the rest of us. She was tomboy all the way, but she could be a lady.
Jacky was leaning her right hand on the wall with her left resting on her cocked-out, curvy hip. She was in her hip-hugger jeans and her favourite mid-drift-showing blue jean shirt. She was showing off that cute little belly button. I loved poking my finger in there, and giving her a good ol’ tickle until she begged for mercy.
She had long, wavy, brown hair. I loved to sit and brush her hair after she’d gotten out of the shower. She took very good care of her hair. It had a smooth texture to it that flowed through my fingers, and the brush. It rarely ever tangled.
Between her lips she held the rare cigarette. We gave up long ago trying to get her to stop smoking them, even if they were just occasional.
When I came up towards the diner, they both threw their arms open and wrapped me up in a group hug. Thankfully Jacky had spit out the cig first. I wrapped my arms around their waist on either side and hugged them close feeling their bodies pressed into mine, and giving their bottoms a pat. Then we exchanged kisses.
“You two hungry?” I asked.
Laverne had that sultry look in her eyes, the one she got when she had her mascara on. She looked me up and down in my jeans and work shirt.
“Mmm, very hungry” she purred.
Jacky giggled, “You slut! At least wait til we get home before you jump him.”We all laughed.
“Come on let’s get dinner so we can go home for dessert.” I said.
With my arms around their waists, I guided them to the door, holding it open. I let them enter first. “I’ve got some exciting news to tell y’all,” Jacky said as she walked by, sliding her fingertips across my left cheek and chin.
“Can’t wait to hear this,” I replied.
“Did you get a raise at work?” Laverne asked.
“You two will have to wait. Let’s eat first.” Jacky said.
After getting seated at our usual table, the waitress, Tabitha, came over with our drinks, saying, “Hey guys!” she said in her bubbly voice, “Your food will be out in a bit.”
“Thanks, Tab, you’re the best.” I said.
“You’re welcome. Be back in bit.” she said. We all watched Tabitha’s hips sway under her short skirt as she headed back behind the counter.
“So when are we going to invite her to join our party for a night?” asked Laverna, “You know all three of us want her.”
“Tonight would be a great night,” said Jacky, “She can join our celebration.”
“What are we celebrating?” I asked.
“Just wait, here comes dinner.” Jacky said.
Tabitha walked over with our food and her ample breasts balanced on a huge tray. Today she was teasing us in a low cut, sleeveless, powder-blue blouse that advertised what was inside by slowing plenty of cleavage. She also sported a huge smile on her lovely, angelic face that lit up the whole diner by itself. Her hips were swaying like a model’s on the catwalk. She had the steps down. When she wasn’t waitressing, or advertising her desires to us, in her subtle ways, she did do some modeling locally. Yes, she knew all about us, and wanted to join us. We were known to invite a third girl or cute gay guy from time to time.
“Here ya go gang. One caesar salad and rolls for Laverne, one ribeye and baked potatoes for Jacky, and one chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes with cream gravy and peas for handsome here.”
“Thanks Tab,” said Jacky. “Got a question for ya, Precious.”
“Ok, go for it,” she said with a touch of excitement in her voice.” Her eyes shined knowing that today was the day.
“How would you like to go home with us to celebrate some good news tonight?”
Tabitha began to squeal, giggle, dance a jig, and clap her hands, “Yes, yes, yes!”
Catching her breath, she asked “What’s the celebration for?”
Jacky had cut a piece of her rib eye, after dashing some A1 sauce on it, and had it hovering at her lips, her eyes danced from one of us to another.
“I’m pregnant,” she said, then slipped the steak between her lips and chewed. Laverna and I just sat there, stunned, like someone just slapped the hell out of us. Tabitha squealed once, like a mouse, her hands flying to her mouth. Jacky swallowed, grinned, and broke the silence. “Surprise!”
We all went wild with cheering, laughter, clapping, and tears. The other patrons gave us dirty looks until we announced to them what the celebration was about. Then they joined us in our joy; there were handshakes, hugs, and joy all around.
After we ate, we stayed around until Tabitha punched the clock. We left there arms-in-arms, stopped at a liquor store for a good bottle of champagne, and then home for a wonderful weekend. And wouldn’t you know, it was Tabitha’s one weekend a month to be off.
Tabitha began joining us regularly. She moved in four months later, and shared Laverne’s room. Jacky had a beautiful baby boy that we named Jr.. Plus Jacky’s mom was so happy to be a grandma. Today, Laverne is three months pregnant. Jr. is walking. Jacky and I are married. Tabitha wants to get pregnant. And we are looking at a 6 bedroom colonial style house for our little family to grow into."

Gina: “There is nothing wrong with having dreams Cindy. Everyone needs a dream. I’m going to live mine.”"

I believe it is, yes. Whether it’s the right so this or that group, or the need to discover purpose, meaning, and value in our own lives we can all draw strength in seeing parallels between what appears to be unrelated circumstances. These parallels can be drawn in various mediums. Today that medium is an old photograph, a magical land where I met two courageous women three quarters of the way through the last century, two women who trekked over the decades-long bridge in my mind to help me make sense of 2016, a year in which I pledge to discover meaningful paths."

They paired me with a genetically enhanced sperm baby or something. That way our kid will be the breadwinner and take care of us when we are older. I don’t want an idiot for a kid,” Sarah said smiling.
“How do you know if we’ll get old and still be together?” Kim said in a soft voice.
“Because, honey, only I can deal with your bipolar-schizo personality.”
Kim slapped Sarah in the face. Sarah slapped Kim. They looked at each other with lust in their eyes. Sarah grabbed Kim by the hair and pulled her down, forcefully kissing her. They both embraced as spectators gathered outside Starbucks with their phones and recorded such a spontaneous lesbian moment. The very next day, lying naked in bed while Kim was at work, Sarah was viewing the viral video shot of them at Starbucks. A friend emailed it to her. Over 900,000 views! “Oh my fucking gosh, we went viral, this is so crazy,” she thought. The next morning Sarah heard a knock at the door. She opened it and Paparazzi were everywhere. She slammed the door.
Sarah called Kim saying, “I can’t even kiss my lover without someone invading my privacy.”
“Sweetie I’ve got...I know, they’re here at my work too.”
For the next six months they both were being bothered by so much attention that they had to make a plan. “We need to fake our own deaths and then we can live with the Indians in the Shasta Mountains,” said Sarah.
“And have all the wild sex we want?” said Kim deviously.
“Without being bothered” Sarah said tightlipped. So in the dead of night they had their friend Abdul rig a timed pipe bomb in their apartment. They rolled away in their hummer to the Mountains in peace and in love. Back in the city their whole apartment burned down very fast. A chemical accelerator was applied. Their baby was born and they named him “Pheonix Fire.” He was so intelligent he built biomechanical cyborg babies for everyone when the technology was available. That way his mothers could live in peace and love each other in the mountains forever."

She starts what she calls small talk, hoping to become more friendly. She says, “Blair can you tell me why it’s 102 degrees on May 1st, what is causing this heat wave and drought?”
Blair cocks her head towards the heavens, leaning against the 7 eleven wall while placing her other hand on her hip. She blows some more smoke through her lips while still holding her camel, a habit that she’s grown accustomed to over the last two and a half summers smoking camel longs. Speaking in a controlled tone, she says, “Candy, the weathers is being controlled and manipulated by a machine named the Haarp Weather Maker. It was created at Edison Labs in the 1920’s by a German Inventor and scientist named Nikola Tesla, he used gamma rays focused at a portion of the sky to create extreme weather. For many years this device went unused because of its unpredictability and lack of control of extreme weather it caused. Just a few years ago Edison Labs sold the Haarp Weather Maker to a world renowned agricultural firm that specializes in pesticides and creating GMOs, named Monsanto. Their scientists have fine tuned this machine for the purpose of controlling all crop production globally simply by creating droughts in farm areas, this is done through directing rainfall to other areas where they own the land outright along with the underground ancient dry aqueducts which they have been filling completely for the last 9 years. They have created a crisis over water in order to one day soon sell it to all the communities of the Earth, ‘He who controls the water, controls all life on the planet, sadly Candy this isn’t all that they have planned, no, in fact it is only the first step in their global domination scheme. They are power hungry, emotionless global tycoon corporation owners. Just in the case that you believe what I said is farfetched, use google.com and search the facts also check the Panama Papers to see if Monsanto is on its lists of corrupt corporations, firms, and subsidories.”
Candy’s head was spinning from what she just heard this enchanted Goddess say. In her mind, she began thinking this girl is crazy, paranoid, on some deep conspiracy area 51 type shit. But when she replied to Blair’s assertion all she said was, “Wow! You remind me of myself when I was around your age with all those ideas and answers. The more I lived, the less I knew for sure, Baby Girl.”
At that moment two black tinted Suburbans drove up fast, coming to a screeching halt directly at the curb right in front of Candy and Blair. Four men jumped out each SUV, dressed in white button down shirts with tie, black slacks and shoes, each fitted with microphone ear pieces and a pair of digit tech black glasses. When they reached the two ladies one produced a black hood made of silk. They grabbed Blair placing the hood over her head, physically picking her up while one injected something into her arm. Immediately her tiny body went limp. They carried her to one of the Suburbans and placed her inside. Candy was in shock and awe which caused her to freeze up completely, while all this was taking place. In her mind, it was like a nightmare. All eight men jump into the SUVs, one passenger side window rolled down and one of the government looking kidnappers speaks firmly saying, “This is a matter of National Security and The State Department, Ms. Candy Spirits. Don’t tell anyone about this or we will be back to pick you up. Know that we are watching, listening, and, infact, know what each person is thinking.” The window went up and, simultaneously they drove off just as fast as they had appeared.
Candy stood there for a moment registering what just occurred. Confusedly thinking, “How did they know my government name? Is Blair in trouble? Are they going to kill that innocent young girl? Was she telling me the truth?” All this made her very nervous. In that moment a grey pulled up to the curb, in front of her, at once causing her to readjust to reality, that is of her immediate environment. An older white man in a newer Benz 500C class screaming “Are you working, honey?”
Candy ran to the passenger door, opened it and hopped in and she was off on another date as if nothing happened. She told the older client “The names Candy Spirits, my rates are $300 an hour, $200 for half an hour, no negotiations and money up front.”
He said “Sure hon,” while fingering through a large stack of bills, passing Candy six denominations of 100 bills.
Candy says, “Okay,” smiling from ear to ear as they drove away..."
12,"""The Doll Hospital"" by Catherine LaFleur",,No,2016.0,05 - May,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Two-Women-picture-3c434cfd69134156b273e517b3ab35a9,Kelly Yu,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGQIs6QbSe34btoUiRNDOJV7r0iLv_BzXoDn44NZihc/edit,No,"Paloma drifted in and out of my life, always showing up just when my mother had enough of me. Her mere presence was enough to distract my mother for months. She played endless games of tea parties with me and made hand-made doll clothes. Whenever one of the dolls broke, she would whisk it away to the “Doll Hospital.” I truly thought there was such a place. My sister would encourage me to fill out get-well cards for my toys while they were in the hospital getting better. Meanwhile, she expertly fixed up dangling ears on Bunny, a tattered paw on Bear, and gave my rag doll a new embroidered face.
Paloma earned her money as a beautician at the Styles of Magic Hair Salon in town. The name alone was enough to spin my parents into a religious fury. One of the best treats for me was being allowed to go to the salon during summer vacation when school was out. Otherwise, I would be stuck in the garden or have to be in religious education all day because both of my parents worked.
My favorite activity at the salon was going through Palom’s purse. I would spread out all of the pictures in her wallet and name each person: myself, mom, and dad, Paloma’s other brothers and sisters, Patrice, Jean, and Michel. I would also investigate her make-up, testing the colors on the side of my hand. My favorite object of all was a pink plastic compact shaped like a daisy with a mirror on the inside.
The day Eddie returned to Paloma, the compact was smashed along with other things. I gazed at the broken flower with shard of glass glittering all around it. Paloma put her hand around my shoulders and told me not to worry about it. She and I would go shopping for a replacement at the flea market that weekend. Eventually, I grew out of sending my dolls to the hospital.
At a time, I was housed in a large prison complex in the north part of the state. The women there kept mostly to themselves. There was a lockdown unit, a psychiatric unit, and most importantly, death row. Three women had made it off the row and were commuted to life without parole sentences.
One of them was Winnie. She allegedly stabbed herself repeatedly with pens and pencils, making a gangrenous mess of her leg, which had to be amputated. Legend has it that this act saved her from death row because at the time, the law required you to be able to walk to the chair under your own power. Whether or not this is true, Winnie was confined to a wheelchair.
Prison is a harsh place and there are plenty of mean girls here. People get shattered by the prison experience. Winnie was involved in a notorious case involving several deaths of children. She was also diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder. Who knows if that is true, but she certainly had emotional and mental problems. At some point, one of the women had made Winnie a doll.
Winnie treated it like her real child, dressing it, rocking it, feeding it. The toy seemed to give her comfort. She would ride it around in the back pocket of her wheelchair. One day, a few young girls decided it would be fun to steal Winnie’s doll. However, they didn’t just steal the doll. They ripped it’s head off, pulled out the stuffing, and threw it in the handicapped shower where Winnie would be sure to find it. The doll was utterly shattered. They hoped Winnie would be too.
Winnie didn’t find it. I did, while I was cleaning the shower. I immediately knew who the doll belonged to. So I took it to my cell, thinking, I guess, maybe I could repair it. I had a lot of hobby craft supplies. One of the great things about being in a two person cell is that you can shut the door and work on projects. I pick out all the stitches and cut out a new doll body. Then over the course of three weeks, I had sewn a new doll for Winnie, trying to make it as close to the original as possible.
When I was done, I walked up behind Winnie and dropped the doll into the back pocket of the wheelchair. I said nothing to her and she did not notice what I had done. The next day, I saw Winnie cradling the new doll and crooning a lullaby.
Sometimes the mirror is shattered but its shards still show pieces of the truth."

We don’t even have a pot to piss in. But you wanna go and tap in our stash to buy an outfit that don’t fit, get your hair done, and cop a loosie!
Sh’early: But I like the 80’s Vern, plus I got a steal at the thrift shop, clearance rack!
La’vern: Yeah well, hope you kept the receipt, Cindy Crawford, cause we need that money for Sqiggy the Science guy, to buil-
Sh’early: Hold that thought and let me think about where I put it while I finish up my square…
La’vern: Oh, you wanna be a smartass! Well then you buil-
Sh’early: Look girl, the 80’s is cheaper, females look like we do, no breast and flat asses, there are more men to choose from, ‘cause you know, like, I know that 80% of men in 2036 are in prison, gas is 98 cents a gallon, and cancer sticks are only $1.50 a pack, plus Reagen is kinda hot.
La’vern: Bitch, you better go sell your flat ass then and make that stash money back to Sqiggy can get us home..
Sh’early: Bitch, you must be on drugs if you think Sqiggy can build us a time machine with $7..
La’vern: Sh’earl we had $10.50, what happen with the other $3.50?
Sh’early: Let me think! Asshole, 3.50-7.00-10.50, are you serious, we need to rob a bank so Sqiggy can have enough money to build that crap..and you whining about some chump change?

La’vern: I got it Sh’earl, I got it!?
Sh’early: 15 cents?
La’vern: No stupid, you said earlier that Reagan is hot. Well, I was thinking, since we’re in DC why don’t we use the 3.50 to catch the metro to go to the White House and maybe you can seduce Mr. President out of enough money so we can get a time machine built.
Sh’early: Umm, that sounds like a plan, but I spent the rest on a can of “Right On!” deodorant spray. But the good news is that Pennsylvania Av. is only 10 blocks away...
La’vern: That’s the reason we’re broke now and in the future! Don’t you know how to save shit.. so hurry your broke, tight-thrift-clothes, twisted-hair-do-wearing, Ronald-Reagan-liking, cancer-stick-smoking ass up and let’s get to the White House..

La’vern: You already did, and it was good (CTFU)!
Sh’early: Uggg! What ever…
La’vern: (Still LOL) come on Sh’earl put it in gear. The 80’s is so ten minutes ago, I wanna get back home. I miss my cat, plus I want to do some scissoring on our air bed.
Sh’early: I forgot to tell you something Vern…
La’vern: Now what!?
Sh’early: Ummm well, I met this guy in the metro thrift store…….??
La’vern: And!!
Sh’early: He asked if I wanted to make a few bucks. I said, doing what? He said “follow me”...we went to this back room, full of clothes in boxes. He dropped his jeans and told me to get to work. “Fuck you,” I said. He said “Damn, no foreplay?” I said, “I mean no kind of sex, period! I’m not a whore! Look, Dr. Strange, I’m outta here.” He pulled up his Levi’s, grabbed my arm, and said “Ok, ok, I’m sorry, let’s start over? Look, I own this place, my name is Trump, Donald Trump… Women don’t like me, so I try to buy sex, or give them cheap clothes for sex. My junk is so small, well, you’ve seen it.” “So what does that got to do with me,” I told him. “You looked like you were lost and in need of something” he said. I told him, “Yeah, well, I do need something, a lot of cash to get a time machine built so that my girl and I can get back to the future.” He gave me a crazy look and said, “The future? I knew there was something different about you. I’m also from the future. Look forget about that time gizmo-thing, I have these pills with numbers from zero to whatever year you need that can take you to past, present, or future.” “For free?” I said. “Well, of course not, ain’t nothing for free,” he said. “I have to work for it huh?” I said. ”Yup, you know it,” he said. Well I got to work Vern. He gave me 2 pills, one had 2017 on it the other was 2036.
La’vern: Let me see, stupid!?
Sh’early: Here, look!
La’vern: Woah, they look like futuristic… but they’re different years!? 19 years apart!!
Sh’early: The catch is that he wants me to be his secretary of state if he gets voted to be president for 2017, and work for him.
La’vern: But you already put in your work at that 5 and dime!?
Sh’early: Well, since you don’t want to stay here in the 80’s, I can't meet Raegen. So why not go back to 2017? At least if Trump gets to be president, I can have sex with him… plus I’m tired of scissoring.
La’vern: Whatever, bitch, give me my pill. I’m out. I’m going back to the newports that cost 25.00 a pack, gas that’s 9.61 a gallon, my cat, and scissoring. At least I can get some decent clothes. Na’nu Na’nu.

Jan started laughing at Kate because of the way Kate was standing, then Abraham took the picture. They they all took a ride in Abraham’s car to go celebrate. So Abraham, Jan, and Kate went to Outback Steak House in Meridian Mississippi to celebrate accordingly. They had a blast just eating, drinking, talking, and cracking jokes. They had so much fun hanging out and being friends, and not taking life for granted. Because that is what life is all about: living for the moment and taking nothing for granted."

Judging by their identical long white dresses, pale skin, and straight raven hair that covered their faces, they must’ve been twins.
Was he hallucinating? Justin wondered. He could have been, considering he’d not slept much in the past two days, cramming for finals. He rubbed his eyes, but they were still there. He bit his lower lip, and the sharp pain and tangy taste of blood validated reality. There was also a strange stench hovering in the air. Spoiled meat? Blood? Were these girls on their periods? Justin got weak in the knees as all his blood rushed to his groin. Pubescent girls on the rag had always been one of his biggest turn-ons.
They spoke in unison: “Let us in. You know you want to.” Their monotone voices made it hard to place an accent, but Justin could have sworn he heard a hint of Russian. Which turned him on even more because he had a fetish for Russian nymphets.
Justin was expecting to find Chris Hansen, and the rest of the To Catch a Predator crew when he peeked out into the hallway, but it was dark and empty as a midnight playground.
“This won’t take long,” they assured him.
They got that right, Justin through as he stepped out of the doorway and motioned them inside.
“Thank you,” they said.
“No. Thank you,” Justin replied.
Now that he could see their faces better, Justin noticed something strange about their eyes. They appeared to be solid black, even the sclera. A rush of fear surged through his body; he had to fight the urge to run screaming from the building, but his sexual desires were even stronger.
I’m just nervous, he told himself. “How about you girls go into my room and make yourselves comfortable?”
They nodded and smiled.
Justin watched as they walked into his bedroom and sat side by side on his bed.
He couldn’t believe his luck! Two identical Russian lolitas were sitting on his bed. All of his wildest fantasies were about to become true! He could barely contain his excitement as he shambled into the room of his gay roommates, Jeff and Chad, to grab a bottle of lube and some condoms.
When he got back into his room, Justin found the twins sitting with their backs to him, staring out the open window. A cool breeze was blowing, causing their hair to billow behind them like smoke from a funeral pyre. They were sitting so close, it looked like they were joined at the hip. They looked so beautifully innocent, Justin almost had a change of heart. Almost.
“All right girls” Justin said, closing the door behind him. “Ready?” A blood-curdling scream pierced the dead of night…"

She did most of the work; I was nearly half her size and she more often carried me like a purse than walk.
The doctors tried everything they could to postpone the inevitable surgery that would separate us. At our underdeveloped age, the risks were outstanding. The plan was to let us get a little older, find a suitable donor for me and do the surgery in marathon style of about twenty two hours.
Just short of our fifth birthday, those plans failed. One morning when neither of us could wake, we were rushed to the hospital. The doctors regrettably had to ask my parents to choose which one of their babies would have the best chance of survival. They would leave a small part of liver in me but with the treatments available, would only give me a twenty percent chance of survival.
Against all odds, the separation was a success--to a point. I vividly remember waking up in pain and feeling empty, and my sister was gone. With only a piece of the liver, I was doing considerably well. The doctors’ only explanation was that I was nearly half the size I normally would be at that age, and so my body didn’t have the usual stress.
My sister didn’t fair so well. She never woke up from the anesthesia. The surgery was successful, but she stayed comatose; her organs began to fail and was put on long term life support. Eventually the decision was made to let her go.
Death from a broken heart? I’m not so poetic to think so. On the other hand, I believe we had kept each other alive somehow by being that close. Sharing the same blood and organ is an intimacy that cannot be replicated or explained. When we were separated, she gave me the gift of life at the cost of her own. I can still feel her here with me."

She had big blue eyes, a cute little nose, full, sensuous (not fat) lips, and graceful curves. She had slender but shapely legs. Her arms were fit and trim but not overly muscular. She had a perfect, clear complexion and long, shiny hair.
It took about three weeks and a dozen or more feeble attempts. Please don’t ask for details: it was a very humbling experience. Happily, though, it ended in a Friday night date. I made some reservations, ordered some tickets online, and bought new clothes.
I had plenty of time. I couldn’t pick her up until seven o’clock; she made that very clear. After she ate a light supper, she and a friend would be doing their hair.
We had a wonderful time that evening. The next Friday was almost as good, and I saw her a couple of times a week after that. Then we were seeing each other almost every day. I was on cloud nine, although I still hadn’t made it past first base.
Then I received this out-of-town job offer. It included a higher salary, more benefits, moving expenses and a signing bonus.
I was so anxious to tell Cathy that I carelessly arrived at her house a half hour early. That was a major no-no. She had impressed upon me early on how she valued punctuality. Being late could often be forgiven, but being early was an inexcusable imposition. As I walked up the path to her front steps, it occurred to me further that she might not want to move. What if she said “No”? Or worse, what if I told her I would have to move and she asked, “So what?”
“We’re up here,” She called down to me. She sounded only mildly irritated. Briefly, I imagined being in bed with her and her friend, both trailing their soft, long hair all over my body.
Such thoughts were not quickly dispelled. Her friend was as beautiful as she was. She had a beautiful face, a sexy body, and long, shiny hair. They could have been twins.
I was sweating badly. I realized that I had dated both women. Suddenly a lot of things made sense. I had noted and wondered only briefly about certain eccentricities that no longer seemed unimportant: she never ate meat on certain days, never ate dessert on certain days; one day she wanted to watch musical comedies, another day she wouldn’t watch anything that didn’t have blood and guts in it.
I stood frozen in her bedroom doorway. Tumbled thoughts swirled in my brain. The swelling in my crotch was at this point more from embarrassment and confusion than lust. I had important matters to discuss with the woman I loved.
“Come on in,” one of them said. “We’ve got a surprise for you.”
On my way home that evening, I saw the sun set behind the hills beyond the wheat fields for the last time. The stars seemed brighter there than they do in the city, and appear earlier. I could just make out the constellation Gemini as I approached my house. I wiped my eyes and pushed the gas pedal to the floor."

Very slowly, but surely. All it will take on our own part is a bit of acknowledgement. They do it. Every single day, by willingly losing money in their restaurant business, which is due to the fact they want you to feel them within your very own heart. I mean, good food does this, you know. It is something all peoples that exist share. Along with dance, song, love, and even sadness.
Beliefs have to get past their own foolishness first, you know. Others are not the problem: we are. And that statement is as equally true as ethnocentrism is terrible. You may feel this, by understanding that somebody can be forgiven by the person they harm. Then, in turn, that individual might look beyond it, his or herself. But if free will is to be held as true, I, as a man, cannot and will never forgive you for trying to rule me based upon how you believe I should live my own life. Because when this happens to me, and it will eventually to all, it makes your persona the purpose of my staying away, causing me to be segregated within.
Please! Understand. I myself have been held toward guilt for this atrocity, just as many have been and will be. Usually it is due to either one or two reasons that when linked together become the worst invention since the dictionary. When we mix our profession of faith with blinded traditional observances, we birth destruction. More importantly, a type based solely upon the foundations of false judgements. The only way to get out of this is by simple teaching, by means of showing. Something even an adult-child can do within their own comfort zone. Yes, all one must do is ask questions in a specifically respectful manner. Then sit back, and allow creation to keep on creating."

The conformed version of me was supposed to subdue me until the “Ghost Squad” showed up to take me away. I was stronger than they had expected and turned the tables. I subdued her instead. Afterwards I grabbed my flash-cube and made my escape out the window by the bed. Thankfully it was a ground level room, or else I would have been done for.
I made my way out of the huge city (think early 2000s New York City times one hundred). I was almost out of the city when out of nowhere, I was blinded by something thrown over my eyes and hauled away to what felt like a hover van. I could feel the subtle ups and downs of hills and turns in the roads. Nobody had even made a single noise the whole ride.
Then we stopped and somebody took off the blinder and told me, “Move.” I did not know what to think, but I followed them because I could sense that they were not “cages” or the “conformed.” It turned out to be a group of illegal freethinkers like myself. Somehow I was observed then rescued by these so-called radicals. They gave me a home and some nanotech to keep my age in check and to feign conformity when needed.
My flash-cube image has been used and seen around the world as an Anarchist Anti-Conformity Rally call. So if you have the feeling you have seen it before, odds are that you have. So keep your head up and do not give into conformity. Resist and Exist!!"

The doctor took off his gloves and apron and asked, “Sir you can come with us?” So I left the room, and when I went out, my family and her family were out there. And they were like, “Did she have the baby?” and I was like, “No, they are taking her to emergency C-section, and I can’t go.” We were on the eighth floor so I jumped into the elevator, went all the way down, walked outside, smoked a whole cigarette and came back inside. I went back up to go check to see what’s up, and right when I walked in, all I saw and heard was, “Oh here she comes!” Alexus just slid out. I never seen nothing like that in my life. It was the grossest, nastiest, craziest, beautiful thing in the world. I didn’t cut the cord because I was in shock. I walked over to Gloria and told her “It’s over babe. I love you” and kissed her. She said, “Go check on the baby.” So I did!
They checked her and cleaned her up then wrapped her up and handed her to me. I just looked down at her and smiled. I felt like crying in my mind. I was like, I made this, this is mine. We were connected; this was daddy’s little girl. I walked over to Gloria and said, “Here babe you want to hold her.” And she said “No you wanted a baby, now you got it: she’s yours.” Gloria is a good mother; she was just messing around. I handed her the baby, and she just held her like nothing new, that was her third child. I took the baby back and just held her until they took her away. Anyway, from that day on, we stuck together like these two girls connected at their hair. I’m serious. I lost my job, stayed home then took care of her while Gloria worked. From the day she was born, all the way until I got locked up, Alexus was right there with me. She was my road dog, my sidekick. I taught her everything: how to crawl, walk, talk, all that.
I just saw her April seventeenth and I’m in AD.SEG so it was through the glass window. And she said, “Daddy do you know what I want?” And I said, “What you want beautiful?” and she said, “I want to give you a hug and a kiss.” I started crying, then she started crying too. She’s only seven years old, and I’m thirty-four. I’ve only got one year left, God willing, until I get out. I can’t wait to hold my baby girl again so we can be connected all over!

She seemed to absorb this comment with the exact sudden comfort which she intended. Revealing a glamorous girl that no trite rock-a-billy icon could ever condescend to fuck with, she smiled. Molly regarded him as though he were the sweetest boy that she ever encountered in her dreadfully friendship-less life. Her smile made up for ten years of his life. He beheld her reluctant gaze. She tried to avert her eyes, but once more, his voice recalled the nucleus of her attention.
“Molly, I see myself in you. So I’mma tell you what I shoulda told myself: This shit ain’t shit, but this shit can fucking kill you. What you are dealing with is death… Please, please just take a couple days to sleep and eat, and you’ll see that things can get better. You seem so unhappy. If you keep going, you are going to die. Please.
“Look around you. You’re stuck in a fucking dope house. Yeah, you’re getting high for free, but is it really free, Molly? You’re worth more than your body. Has anybody ever given a fuck enough about to tell you that?”
A single tear besmeared her too thick mascara. “My mom,” she quivered.
“Well, she’s right. What the hell are we doing? Running from our families, from ourselves. You think you’re the only one who’s in pain? You think nobody understands what you’ve been through? Huh?” She shook her head and shook a tear from her cheek. “I can’t stop either. They used to tell me I was 14 going on 40. Now I’m just going on 40. Look at me.” She could hardly do anything else. “Molly, my future is in the past. But you are worth saving. Fuck all these idiots around here. They have no souls. But you--aw, fuck it.” He searched her eyes for understanding. With something like the tinkling bell which signifies the ceremony for an angel who finally got wings, she confirmed her comprehension.
If he had stayed in the antechamber of her spirit a moment longer, he surely would have begun to cry. So he went into the kitchen and shot some dopr. He did a little too much and fell onto the carpet in the living room, clawing at his chest and begging God to forgive him for all of his sins--too many to recount in the split second of death."

THey started mentally tracking arrays everywhere they went and became more and more disinterested in interacting with other people. The more their father tried to suggest extracurricular activities, the more resistant to social involvement they became. They preferred to analyze the world from the margins, mostly because what they saw--contention, corruption, despair, the System--they didn’t like. On walks, at school, even at home during dinner, they silently constructed array-grid models together in a cog-sym bubble accessible only by them. Mr. Lin could only frown in disapproval and shout, “Girls, stop that!” They just giggled and continued to triangulate and manipulate the System. Their gift became not so cute anymore.
The cognitive-symbiosis bubble they built grew exponentially as their thought speed increased constantly. By the time they were pre-teens, the arrays could no longer track Meisha/Keisha. Their neural energy was undetectable: they were virtual voids.
At first, their father just accepted it. Though worried, he felt there was nothing he could do. His daughters were anomalies. He only hoped nothing bad would come of their digital non-existence. Maybe they would find something useful or harmlessly creative to do with their talent.
In a way, he got his wish. The twins wanted a more personal space, so they decided to build their own city beneath the surface of the largest planet in our solar system: Jupiter. Their dad may have been proud if the project wasn’t funded by billions of stolen dollars. It was a theft untraceable from millions of accounts since the girls instantly re-created the money electronically, a trick they did several times before for fun but on a much smaller scale.
Stealth drone jet fleets flew tons of material and automated construction bots to the jumbo planet. Jupiter has been surveyed and sampled, but remained unpopulated since no one had the funds to have robo-constructors durable and advanced enough to operate in the sub-zero slush terrain and atmosphere. Their city was spacy and distance, as they wanted. Since money to the Void Twins was infinitely replaceable, hydrogen fusion-powered machinery put their project on the fastest, undetectable, most efficient track possible.
By their 18th birthday, their city, miles beneath Jupiter’s frigid surface, was complete. It was basically a bioµ´encasing a massive maze of climate controlled corridors and plush living spaces, as well as a bio-engineered ecosystem. All surfaces were of synthetic interactive titanium. Farms were plentiful with automated maintenance. Every atom and fiber in the city were known and felt by the twins like nerves on the surface of their skin, functionally connected as their ability to blink.
Sitting in one of their many rooms, they posted their first holo vid on Facebook VR. This was mainly to let their dad know about their whereabouts. Still, they felt it was in good taste to offer something visually artistic, so they improvised 3-D printed hair follicle nanobots, then mindfully intertwined their hair into a single braid before introducing the world to theirs. THis was the first time they allowed others to interact with them since becoming voids. The mass of questions, requests, and constant noisiness soon annoyed Meisha/Keisha.
And when their father began to scream demands that they return, they had enough of social media. The System lost track of them for the last time.
The twins decided that only quiet, inquisitive minds would populate their biome. They sat for hours in search for the sincerest serene souls on Earth. The first one they touched was a kindred spirit, also in exile.
He was doing life for multiple counts of mind-hacking and mental assaults as a teenager, but he was no longer entertained by abusing minds with modified psyware. In fact, now in his 40’s, after over 20 years of being alone with his own mind, a reverant interest in human consciousness grew in him. So he spent much of his time enjoying the profound, poetic muses of the mind by ancient philosophers such as Descartes, Kant, and Schopenhauer. As he read a passage from the latter (“A man’s life, in all its events great and small, is as necessarily predetermined as are the movements of a clock.”), he heard a distinct, clear, double-whisper as if inside both his ears at once, “It’s time to leave.” Before he could question the voices, an intercom blared an announcement: “Inmate Diles, pack your property for transfer!”"

They pretend to be good and God fearing. Their TV pastors preach what they claim is the word of God, but they wear a different designer suit every Sunday, and they all think God has something different to say. How can there be only one God with so many different churches. They flash their million dollar smiles and pass the plates around collecting more and more. I could feed my family for a week with what they spend on their morning coffee. They turn up their noses, they scoff, and they laugh when I hold out my hat for some spare change.
We had to leave that place. What kind of father would I be if i raised my family in an environment of disrespect, evil, and darkness? How could I raise my niño around people who steal from the poor to buy shiny cars, and get expensive surgeries and coffee? I wear my sandals in January so we can afford to buy our niño warm clothes. Their churches and government refuse to help us because we are not one of them, and I thought that all God’s children were created equal. This is the new Gomorrah, and I want no part of it. They blame our people, but their meth, and their drugs are the evil that are killing this country. In some states they practically give you marijuana, but in other states they can give you up to 10 years for a roach and some trumped up charges. I don’t understand how one country can have so many conflicting laws. In Colorado you’re fine to do as you will, but drive a few miles into Oklahoma you would end up in prison. A country that claims to be so free has the highest prison population in the world. Most of the people in prison are there for little to no reason. They’re mostly the poor. I’m poor, and my son probably will be too, so we must leave. There are so many snakes and scorpions that would probably kill him before he even made it to prison.
This country is filled with hate. They don’t want us there, but when we get there, we are stuck. This entire country feels like a prison. It has walls, gangs, and we are persecuted and oppressed on the daily. My family has almost been killed in gang violence three times. America is a country that would ruin my family's honor, and teach them vanity and laziness. Money is the God of America.
After two weeks in the desert running and hiding from these snakes, we decided that Mexico was the best place for us. I returned to Mexico and took a day on a hammock with my wife and niño snuggled up together. We have food and water, and we have each other. That is all we need. To see the contentment and happiness in my family’s eyes on this hammock is the greatest happiness a man can have. In America they have shiny cars, and nice clothes, but here we have this. Each other."

Watch and see.” There was only one woman around my age inside the bar playing pool or really just sitting there. So I see the old lady and young woman enter the restroom, and the young woman exits first. I tell the bartender, “What kind of beer is that girl drinking?” She said, “Bud Light.” So I replied, “Give me a bucket of Bud Light and two dollars in quarters.” So she does it.
I’d never in my life approached a woman in a bar or any other place for that matter. I was green! I didn’t have a clue what I was going to say or do. I was nervous, but I told myself, “I got this.” So I walked over to this girl and said, “Excuse me, would you like to play a game of pool with me and have a drink?” She just looks up at me and doesn’t say anything. The guy next to her is silent too. I said “ummm okay” and just stood there, and right when I was fixing to turn around and leave, the older lady comes out of the restroom and says “Hey, what’s up? Who are you?” I told her, “I’m Chris. I was just asking this young lady if she wanted to play some pool.” She replied, “Oh that’s my daughter. She’s not your type, but I’ll play with you.” So I said, “Okay, here goes some beer, I bought it for you.”
I grabbed one and took a sip, trying to look cool. So I put some quarters in the pool table and start racking the balls, and this lady starts asking me 21 questions. I didn’t lie to her, I told her the truth, “I just got out of prison. I got no kids. I got a job. And I’m looking for a woman.” She asked me if I cared about other girls with kids, and if I would hook up with a girl with kids. And I replied “Yeah, I ain’t tripping.” Well I was looking towards the bar and I already knew they were making fun of me for playing pool with this older lady. Anyway, the lady tells me about her other daughter Gloria, and I was like, “Where is she?” and she replied, “At home,” so I didn’t think too much about it, and I just said “Well, nice meeting you,” and went back to the bar.
The first thing they asked me was, “Did you get that old lady’s number?” And I said no. About an hour went by and it was getting late, and the bar was fixing to close. All of a sudden, the young woman taps me on the shoulder and says, “Here is my number, call me tomorrow!” and she turns around and leaves.
I declared “already” and grabbed the $100 off the bar. The bartender thought it was a set up. It wasn’t, and I gave her $20 and kept $80. Well the next day during lunch break at work, I called the number and this girl answers and I said, “This is Chris, you gave me your number last night.” She replied “Oh yeah, I’m Lisa. But I don’t want to talk to you, I want you to talk to my sister Gloria. She’s working now, but is this your number?” I told her yes, and she said, “I’m going to text you my sister’s number and you call her.”
Well I called her, and I asked, “What’s up, this is Chris and I met your mom and sister.” So we start talking on the phone every day. We would fall asleep on the phone. I didn’t meet her, but she lived right around the corner. We were both scared. Well before I met her I told her over the phone, “I know this might sound crazy since I never met you, but I love you.” And she said, “You’re just telling me that because you want to have sex.” I replied, “Nah, for real I’m falling in love with you.”
Well, I started telling my grandma about this girl, and my grandma said, “I want to meet her first. So I agreed. Anyway one day I met Gloria, and it was love at first sight. I didn’t see nothing wrong with her. It was dark outside, and I couldn’t see her too well, but I knew she was the one. She had a 32oz Budweiser in a brown paper bag, and I was like “OMG this chick is ghetto,” but she didn’t look or act ghetto.
So I said, “She told me she drinks so it ain’t no surprise.” Well after that we kept talking. I kept telling my grandma about her. So I finally took Gloria to meet my Grandma. Let me tell you that my grandma pretty much raised me, and she has stood by my side no matter what. She is my rock.
Well Gloria comes over to my grandma’s, and right when she walks inside, Gloria says, “Ms. Josie, is that you?” My grandma’s name is Josie. Gloria and my grandma used to work with each other. My grandma kept a picture of me on her desk and supposedly Gloria used to tell my grandma “Hook me up with your grandson, Ms. Josie. I’m going to take him away from you.”
My grandma said, “Nope, he’s mine, you can’t have him.” Anyway, we all talk and stuff, and after Gloria leaves, my Grandma tells me, “Mijo, she’s a good woman. Treat her good.” So that was that. We have been together since and have 4 kids together. At this time, I haven’t heard from her, but I’m fixing to get out, and I will do everything in my power to get her and my kids back. The word of God says, “The Lord will restore my family if I just trust in our Lord and God Jesus Christ.” And that is what I’m doing. Please keep me in your prayers. For Morales family: Michael Chris Morales, Gloria, JayJay, Rubi, Mexus, and Aiden. Thank you, and God bless."

I wondered what I really would wish for if I had 3 wishes. “Money. I wish for money,” I mumbled to myself as I fell asleep.
I was awoken to a telephone call. My parents were killed in a terrible accident during the night. I would find out later that day that I had inherited all that my parents had--and it was a lot.
I was once a drug addict, but I had been clean for years. The death of my parents brought back a craving so strong, I couldn’t think of anything other than scoring some drugs and feeling release. “Drugs. All kinds. A lot of them. That’s what I wish for,” I mumbled as I fell asleep.
I was awoken to a banging on the door in the middle of the night. An old friend of mine said he was in trouble. He said he needed to stash his drugs at my house for a while, but I could keep some for myself. The addict in me agreed, and I was doped up before my wife and daughter even woke up.
When my wife woke up and saw the state I was in, she told me she wasn’t going back to our old life. She told me she was leaving me. She packed up my daughter and left me. What did I do? More drugs, of course! Hey, they were there, so why not?!
In my desperation to numb the pain, I used way too much. Just when I thought I was about to die, I yelled out, “God, help me! I wish I had a different life.” That was when the police kicked the door in. It was a raid. I was taken to the hospital, where I was treated, then I went to jail, where I still sit.
This picture is all I have left of my wife and daughter. That’s me, the idiot who had a loving wife and a precious baby in front of him but was too busy thinking about wishes to notice.
Take it from me: live the life you have. Rock it! Love those who love you, and to hell with those who don’t. Don’t wish for more. You may just wake up and find that you’ve wished it all away."

The new rooms he added didn’t even have electricity the first year, but with a few walls made of used brick and a little help from some of his friends from church, he enclosed a large area of what had been a brown lawn. He tore up the surviving grass and weeds, and laid down a beautiful tile floor. Those patio tiles were the only building material he bought new and paid full price for.
His wife was furious when he told her he had no money left for furniture. He did manage to set up a huge hammock.
She must have forgiven him. They had a daughter nine months later.
This past summer, Juan told her he had enough money for some nice furniture for the house or a small air conditioning system. She told him to set up another college fund and not to worry about furniture or air conditioning. He lay down beside her and the baby, and they talked for hours about their dreams for the future."

What did she do about that? The FBI investigation was swift.
Black Lives Matter? How much? Any investigations of the murders of unarmed blacks by police in Minnesota and Louisiana is “ongoing”, you know. Black Lives Matter versus Blue Lives Matter became a vociferous competition for scarce judicial resources. The FBI at Orlando was prompt-sodomites got preferential treatment. Investigations at Dallas are stymied because police can’t number how many snipers there truly were Acknowledge that there were multiple snipers. Assess how Blue Lives Matters concepts were damaged. Not all snipers need guns. Black Lives Matter? Well, of course… and investigators will get around to Minnesota and Louisiana in the fullness of time. These matters have to wait their turns.
Black Lives Matter… but not at Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit(note well the name) in Amarillo, and not in TDCJ as a whole. Cop-killer Rodgers, believing his food was poisoned, starved for about 60 days. What did TDCJ employees know?(answer: They knew cop-killer Rodgers had reported his food was poisoned, and that TDCJ Ombudsman from Huntsville headquarters said it wasn’t) When did they know that? (Answer: The report was in November 2015) What did they do about that? (Answer: In January 2016 they fired TDCJ Major Rowdy Boggs.) Black Lives Matter… but not much, to TDCJ employees. TDCJ Office of Inspector General Legal Assistant Susan Machutt said the investigation into cop-killer Rodgers’ death will “be open for quite a while”. (The newspaper story:”Autopsy: Inmate was starving when he died” by Aaron Davis, Amarillo Globe News April 01, 2016) Investigators will get around to doing something in the fullness of time. The matter of cop-killer Rodgers has to wait its turn, like the matters of the killings of the blacks in Minnesota and Louisiana.
Black Lives Matter? How Much? Dallas Police Department has a parking garage nearby. At 1800 hours on July 09, 2016 Saturday, ABC Radio News reported that downtown Dallas had been condoned off again. A suspicious person was in the parking garage with a clear line of sight to Dallas Police Department headquarters. The area was searched. Nobody was found, of course. Police paranoia might be less when Black Lives Matter versus Blue Lives Matter controversy is nothing near the Irish Republican Army versus British troops conflict. IRA snipers killed many a Black and tan. Police could defuse the Black Lives versus Blue Lives stand off before it escalates to that level. We could measure how much Black Lives Matter by how much federal prison time the cops in Minnesota and Louisiana do for the murders they did.
Do Black Lives Matter in Amarillo? We could tell Gwendolyn Rodgers in Dallas that they do, by pointing out how much federal prison time TDCJ employees do for the death of her son Alton Rodgers, and we could pray for her and her son. Let his needless death be the final needless death.
That was my guest column for Amarillo Globe News Looking at Getty Images 322-8493 again, remembering heroic army veteran Micah Johnson, considering cop-killer Alton Rodgers’ needless death… do Black Lives Matter enough?"
60,“Night of Fun” by Shannon Richardson,,No,2016.0,08 - August,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Soldiers-picture-b111246d90bc442e98baf97f26d69178,Kelly Yu,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezq_5BGxSm9dzhVJQsJQos8ylEpCUqmqBSFiQyaaHFI/edit,No,"My brother, Darrell, left home about a year ago. He didn’t give us a reason and he didn’t tell us bye; he was just gone. I think my parents knew more than they let on because every time his name came up, my father got angry and my mother cried. I think my mother knows where he is and sneaks out to see him sometimes. Either that, or she is sneaking food, clothes, and other stuff out to someone else.
Anyway, Darrell is a few years older than me - plenty old enough to go drinking. I remembered seeing his license the last time I was in his room. He had left it in the wooden tray on his dresser. Sure enough, there it was. I figured what would it hurt - it wasn’t like he was using it!
So I borrowed my brother’s license (and some of his clothes) and headed out for the night. I told my parents I wouldn’t be home until the next day. They thought I was hanging out at Dan’s house. I believe my mother had a bad feeling because she grabbed me into a tight hug. That was unlike my mom.
The night started out great. There were six of us in the car that night. We went to Dave’s Bar on the corner of seventh street and had a couple of beers. It was great to get together with my friends and celebrate Dan’s upcoming marriage.
I was driving on the way to our next destination when we were pulled over. The cop suspected I was drinking and driving. That turned out to be the least of my worries.
I handed him my license...or so I thought. What I actually handed him was my brother’s license. I left mine at home.
When the cop came back to the car, his gun was drawn - and pointed at me. I didn’t understand what was happening. I had never been in trouble before. The next thing I know, I was being cuffed and put in the back of the cop’s car. I only had two beers, so I knew I wasn’t drunk. It just didn’t make any sense to me!
Well, it turns out that my brother left home for a reason. He was a draft dodger. He had been drafted into the war, but he ran. When they ran his license, this information came up. I kept telling them it was my brother but they didn’t believe me. Honestly, I think as long as they had a body - any body - they didn’t care.
I was sent to the closest army base and waited to be shipped out. In the meantime, I was made to participate in boot camp and training.
I’m in the picture you’re looking at. I’m at the end of the first row. I have my hands together because I was praying for a way out of the mess I had gotten myself into. That was the last picture ever taken of me. I never did make it home - not alive, anyway. To think, all of this happened all for a night of fun."

We got work to do!” After the noise dies down, he resumes - “They don’t like us. We know that. Heck, half the country thinks we don’t even belong here. The other half thinks we’re not ‘sophisticated enough’ to fly no planes. Well, guess what? I don’t care what they think. We are the Tuskegee Airmen! Not only are we flying those mini-bombers, but we’re the best da-gone pilots this country has ever seen.”
Frankly, after a short while, I tune him out. The commander’s patriotic rhetoric usually precedes our missions: How great this country is; how we should be proud to sacrifice our life for it and hope they recognize our value and afford us equal rights.
As if, unlike all other races in this country, we have to earn decent treatment. But the truth is, no race has contributed more free labor in creating this country ten us. PERIOD: Blood, sweat, tears, and pregnant women hanging from trees while their babies hung by their umbilical cords.
“Alright, mission starts at 0700 hours. Be ready. The United States Navy will not wait on you,” With that, Commander Springwell storms out the room, leaving us to ponder another arduous mission.
“Man, I’m tired of this shit!” Larry - on the bench directly behind me - announces, like he always does, “If we was white, we would have the new planes instead of those cheap crap.”
“Not today, Larry,” Latrel says and gets up, “The way I see it any mission could be our last. And if I’ma die out here, ‘lest I could do is get me some pussy ‘fore I go!”
“You ain’t think you made enough high-yellow babies out here yet. ‘Finna have Germany lookin’ like Harlem in no time.” Big Willy said from the last seat on the second bench.
“Let’s get the party started then,” Larry says and gets up, bracing a hand on my shoulder as he does.
“We gotta pretty early start tomorrow,” I say, always sounding like the annoying grandmother.
“We know,” Jamal - the Tuskegee graduate - concedes.
“Shie, better get it out our system ‘fore we go back home; that respect-for-a-blackman-shit will be over.” Latrel’s comment sanctions a stale silence that dominates the room. We avoid each other’s eyes, suddenly finding meaningless tasks to occupy ourselves with.
The truth is, the real fight - for us, at least - is back home. Brothers like Malcolm, Luther - even the boxer, Muhammed Ali - are making headlines condemning America for doing exactly what we’re doing. How are we supposed to feel? Serving as agents of an imperialistic regime looking to oppress people of color like they’re doing us.
**My girlfriend’s stopped replying to my letters. She’s joined “The Revolution”. To her, I’m a hypocrite; a boot-licking “Uncle Tom”!
Somberly, one at a time, we all mope out the room, a slight slump in our shoulder.
Out the dining hall, across the compound - beneath a gloomy night - we all enter our sleeping quarters. We each go to our bunks and stew in thought. Out the window, by the field of planes, crickets, frogs, and other critters in the night ridicule us with an ominous chorus.
“Well, I’m finna’ go partying ‘fore we get into this dog-fight tomorrow. Who’s coming?” Latrel’s words - aimed at infusing some levity back into the situation - splatter against the wall and slowly slide down onto the dirt floors.
“Man, I’m going to sleep,” Jamal says and turns towards the wall.
“Shie, that’s what I’m doing,” Big Willy echoes.
One by one, those sentiments are repeated throughout the dorm.
“How ‘bout you, Dewayne,” He finally asks me.
“Naw, bra’, sleep’s what I’m doing.”
“Shie, why is that?”
“Because, in this situation, ain’t nothing to party about.”
And with that, I too, turn around, face the wall, and call it a night."

Then the door opened. The man who entered was not the captain. It was Corporal Agar. Someone said “Don’t take another step unless you’re bringing some coffee.”
When you’re on the front lines in a world war, coffee is very important.
“I have some news from the short wave,” Agar responded anxiously. He immediately had the crowd’s undivided attention.
When you’re in a bunker three hundred feet underground, news from abroad is very important.
“M5 has confirmed that the caliph is dead.” Agar obviously had more to report, but he was immediately drowned out by cheers, and by someone (Carmody?) bellowing “Well then, to hell with coffee! Break open a barrel.”
That suggestion was very well received. When you’ve been living on C rations, coffee, and peanut butter for six months, a celebratory flagon of rum can be very important.
A consensus seemed to be developing that the war would probably be over within another year or two. Bob knew better. Before he was vaporized, his grandfather had warned him the Jews would not stop until the temple was restored, the Mohammedans (That’s what he called Muslims) would not stop until the Dome of the Rock was cleansed, and the Americans would not stop as long as there was oil under the sands of Iran. Bob’s grandfather had been right about many things.
Agar was talking about the death toll from a new weapon technology developed by France, stolen by Russian spies, and sold to insurgents in Turkey. No one could understand much of what he said in all the noise and confusion, and Bob didn’t really think he could have followed it all, anyway.
A major victory had just been won! A few million civilian casualties were not important.
When the captain finally arrived, order was immediately restored. Appropriate salutes were made (rather sloppily, when you’ve been eating, sleeping, showering, and even using the bathroom together for two years, such formalities are not important). The orders, output by the computer on rice paper from a high speed printer, were quickly passed out.
Bob went to his cubicle, grabbed his mouse, clicked on the icon of an old-fashioned airplane (possibly a Sopwith Camel), and keyed in the GPS coordinates of a grade school in Sierra Leone. It seemed to him that there was something inherently unjust in killing children 1500 miles away. As soon as he said the word “launch”, his voiceprint appeared on the screen and his drone took off. In the third decade of a just war that had already claimed a billion lives, nothing was more important than following orders."

Most of us don’t have the slightest clue as to who we really are, and we are scared to find out. When you put someone alone by themselves for a while, a lot of things surface. Demons from our past come rushing at us in a whirlwind of what ifs and if onlys. The average person isn’t comfortable in their own skin so these masks are created to shield us from our own worst enemy: ourselves.
Nietzsche said it best: “When staring into the abyss, be careful fo rit may stare back into you.” So the next time you look in the mirror, ask yourself who is in the glass staring back. Is it me, or who I want to be, or who I was told to be?"

Will anybody even notice?
Will life continue to walk on by and walk over and walk around and refuse to LOOK AT ME? Will it be too much to witness? Or like a horrible collision on the freeway, will everybody stop and stare?

“Straight missionary. Afterward we trash the video. I do whatever you want on the case”.
Princess surrendered with a resigned sigh. “For the first time in my marriage!”. She rose from the table. “That’s our deal. Nothing oral, just regular missionary. You destroy the video. You help me on the murder case”.
“Almost! Nothing oral on your part. Fellatio has always been a turn-off”. My chair squeaked as my weight pushed it back. “But you have to let me kiss anywhere I like. Nose to toes, it all goes. Regular missionary other than that. I’ll destroy the video. I’ll help you on the murder case. Deal?”.
Princess looked at the linoleum. “Deal, then. Let me get a shower”.
My finger found her zipper. My hand moved gently downward. “You’re clean enough”.
Princess let me lead her to my front bedroom. She permitted me to unbutton the rest of her beige blouse, then hang it up. Princess reached into her bra for her ID folder. She sat it on the dresser. Her cell phone came out next. A tiny change purse followed. Several loose bills were unloaded. A small notepad was last. Finally she reached behind her to unlatch the beige bolder-holder. “All right. Here you are”. She turned to face me for the liberation scene. They might have been only d-cup but they appeared to be double-d. She allowed me to hang up her bra with her blouse.
On my dresser was a plastic box that originally had been a soap dish. On top of the box were a set of 9 illuminated push buttons. Normally the lights are off for default. When I hung up Princess’ bra, all nine were flashing in random combinations. Why would the sparkle circuit be activated? “Princess? You wouldn’t, by any chance, have touched this, would you?”.
Princess came to the dresser. “I put everything at the other end, here. I never touched that”. She watched the lights dance. “Is it some kind of radio?”.
“Would KD5CHN possess a soap dish with illuminated push buttons if it weren’t?”. The four corner buttons were tapped. “On. Three. Nine. Seven. Your turn. Press the 5 button”.
Princess reached in front of me to initiate the 1397 process. Her left breast brushed my cheek. She pressed the center 5 button. The Jeep honked once, then paused. It gave three more honks, then waited. Then it counted off nine short honks. Lastly it sounded seven honks. All push button lights went off. The 1397 process was complete.
Princess shrugged. “What was that about?”.
“You liked my story. ‘The two-five-five project’ about the robot we built in 1975 in high school. The soap dish there is an updated version of the Prisoner Express story. The Jeep has a proximity sensor. Someone entered my yard. They got close to the Jeep. It sent a signal to make this box Sparkle. Then you scared off the thief”.
Princess didn’t go to the window. Topless, she was in no shape to do it. “Look, let’s get a room. I’m uncomfortable feeling like there are eyes everywhere.” She reached to redeem her bra.
“Deal’s off?”
Princess was in no shape to rescind her word. “No. A deal is a deal.”
One last look at those luscious breasts made me sigh with as much resignation as Princess had sighed at the table. “Get dressed.” Yeah, You Can Run, Princess Gold, But You Can’t Hide. “A deal is a deal, you said?” The spooked cop’s dignity was offered for redemption. “I’ll take a raincheck.”
“Raincheck!” She agreed abruptly. Princess had found her way out. She’d found a way to delay accepting responsibility for tossing dope in my lap, on video. “You’ve got that in the bank. My word on that, Tee Dee.”
“On call. When I want it.”
“On call. Anytime.” Princess fastened her bra. “Will you take me to Fiesta on Airline Drive at North Freeway, where you picked me up? My car is there.”
On the trip northward back up Airline, a radical thought clicked. We stopped behind a red roller skate subcompact in Fiesta parking lot. “Here, take my house key. There’s no booby traps, nothing. I want you to come and go around my Shack any time you please. Peppermint’s friend is always welcome. Just leave a note on the refrigerator notepad.”
The would-be adulteress, redeemed at least for the nonce, waved as she drove away."

Has wording similar unto these;
“Allah divided his Mercy into one hundred parts.
One part HE dispensed evenly
Among the animals and mankind,

Will serve as a means of reprieve
To relieve all the reformed sinners who will probably grieve
Because unexpectedly their sins could possibly be forgiven
In an act of Heavenly Redemption."

Darkroom was right: I couldn’t see anything. Even after a few minutes in absolute darkness, my eyes adjusted, but unlike dark rooms at home, there was no light coming through the crack in the door jams or from underneath. Just when I felt the first moments of terror creep up on me, the room lighted up in a blood red luminance.
“This is the light we can work with while unexposed film is out. Any other light will ruin the exposure,” Dad told me. He moved like a surgeon over his patient. Deftly opening the film, he took down bottles of liquids and poured each of them out into large, shallow trays. He did some other things so fast I couldn’t keep up, so I let my eyes wander around the room. There wasn’t much, but there was another little door in the far back that looked like a storage closet. Some shelves with boxes marked “left-overs” and “special care” were around, and directly behind us and across from the counter was a small wall painted an unusually dark, dull black paint. As I stared at it, I felt like it was staring back. The paint was perfect and had no flaws to show depth, almost as if nothing was there.
When I looked back at Dad, he had film loaded up in the big microscope-looking device. He said this was an old technique, but it was the best the school could afford. Most pictures don’t get developed anymore because they’re digital.
He turned to the machine, and it made a noise. “OK, that’s it,” Dad said. I didn’t say that I was disappointed, but all that work and that was it.
He took the piece of paper out from under the machine and told me it was special, photographic paper. He put it into one of the trays filled with chemicals, and I watched as a picture of our trips to Santa Monica beach appeared from the blank white abyss. It was magical: I couldn’t help but smile, and Dad smiled back at me. “That’s like magic, Dad.”
“Yes, not many photos are developed by the photographer anymore. That’s only part of the reason I brought you today. You wanna see something really, really cool?” I did.
He took a silver box with some fancy carvings from a shirt pocket. It was about the size of a cigarette pack, and it didn’t have any obvious hinges that I could make out in the dim red light, but with a twist of his wrist, it opened. From it, he produced a large but single photo negative, and he loaded it up like before then asked me to step back. Instead of putting photographic paper on the counter beneath the machine, he pointed the image at the black wall behind us.
The image was of a small mouse near the bottom of the wall. I recognized him immediately. The all white fur except the little black spot on his forehead reminded me of Indian women. The image was of Mickey, my pet mouse. He was my first pet, and I loved him even after Mrs. Kitty decided he was lunch, leaving me to find his remains smattered all over my room. He had been dead for a few months, but to my little heart, he would always be my friend. “Dad, I miss Mickey.”
“I know. He was a good mouse as far as mice go. You ready?” I nodded, and he turned off the red light. The only thing visible was Mickey, the ghostly image staring bright from the wall. Dad clicked the machine, and the image disappeared as we were immersed in total darkness.
Then I heard a squeak. The red light came on again, and sitting against the wall and twitching his little whiskers, he was all white with a little black dot on his forehead.
I put Mickey into a box and took him home. That was 30 years ago, and though Dad passed away recently Mickey is still with me and not a day older. Dad left me the little silver case which was empty when I first opened it, but I have a large negative that was with it. A picture of Dad before the cancer, and thankfully, the school still runs the photography class."

I spent three years in prison.
I learned how to pick locks, weaponize plastic bags, and sharpen a shank. I learned several new ways to masturbate when the guards weren’t looking, and when a couple ways when they were (Miss Smith once paid me a honey bun). I learned how to hustle, how to con new inmates out of their money, and I improved my card game until I could make at least ten dollars a week at the poker table.
I learned that James had been busted for trafficking, but he copped a plea and got off with six months probation.
I thought about that a lot: I recalled how James told me, during one of our more serious philosophical dialogues, to trust no one. Always stare your enemy in the eyes, but watch your friends covertly. Keep personal and business information on a need-to-know basis, and our most important secret is not to be shared with anyone. Show your enemy your fists and let your friends see your hands. In life as in poker, keep your arms above the table, but always have an ace up your sleeve.
Although I totally disregarded what he told me, I had always trusted him.
I gave the eulogy at James’ closed casket funeral. I spoke of the little boy everyone loved, and I said nothing of how he died. I’ve never told anyone what I know about that drug deal that went bad. Privately, I shared with a friend after the intermission the best advice James ever gave me. On the way to a poker game one Friday night, he told me: Don’t watch your dealer’s hands. They’re too fast for you. Watch his eyes."

I ran. Just in time, it seemed, I ran until I was out of breath and then ran some more. Looking back over my shoulder, I could see the ground where I was standing, torn up, smoking and on fire.
Not wanting any part of their conflict, I kept going until I couldn’t go any further. Falling on the ground, I spoke under my breath, “Those guys are going to wipe each other out, if they don’t knock that shit off.” That’s when I heard that special WHOMP that comes from a large explosion. The tree was now a pile of flaming splinters, with a mushroom cloud growing into the sky above.
A couple of hours later, I sat down and wished I’d packed a lunch. “This sure would be a good place for a McDonalds.” Before I could finish the thought, in the time it takes to blink, a full blown McDonalds was there perfect in every detail down to the drive-through. Ordering lunch, I noticed that the only wierd thing was that all the staff were faries or pixies or nymphs or something. The food wasn’t strictly Micky D’s, but it was tasty.
Gnomes and elves, gnomes and elves, gnomes and elves. They had a town that was literally cut in two with a wall almost as tall as me. The elves challenges me; the gnomes welcomed me. I was fed, clothed, and given a place tos tay for the next couple of weeks. That first afternoon, I was invited to almost every gnome home and given a massive plate of food. I tasted everything and passed out late that night, stuffed and very drunk from the beer they kept pouring.
While I played with the gnomes, they taught me about my magic, and I helped them straighten out their defenses. We built a moat, and they showed me how to make things appear and go away with just my words. At one point, I even made an entire neighborhood move three feet to the left, just because I thought it would look better that way.
I moved on. Mostly because I couldn’t sleep on the floor of their meeting hall anymore. I had a crick in my neck that just wouldn’t go away. I slept roughly for a couple of nights and found myself tired, muddy, and bruised from a fall down a steep slope into a muddy stream. “A nice, hot bath sure would be nice right about now.” Nothing happened.
“I said… A Nice Hot Bath Sure Would Be Nice Right About NOW!” I repeated with a bit more force. Still, nothing happened. Perplexed, I moved out of the water and into a stand of willows. That was when I heard the sound of hoofbeats coming from both up and down stream. I baked further into the thicket until I was up against the trunk of an older, larger tree.
Two armed and fierce looking groups of centaurs met in battle right in front of me. Screams, warcries, and the clash of bladed weapons echoed through the hills. “I just want to be unnoticed, like a part of this tree.” I spoke that without thinking.
Now I’m stuck here. I cannot move, or speak or blink. I haven’t laughed or cried, screamed or spoken a word in countless days. I’ve seen the seasons come and go so many times that I’ve lost counts.
Oh shit, here comes the squirrels..."

There is so much hatred out in the world!
Whether it’s abroad or right here in the USA, have you ever wondered why there is so much hatred in the hearts of mankind? I can’t give you an easy answer--it’s taken years and years for everything to get so messed up! But what is amazingly astounding to me is the fact that a lot of people feel like nothing is wrong at all.
We have homeless people, unemployed people, and starving kids living in poor conditions--right here in America. And yet we want to open the borders and let hundreds of thousands, millions of immigrants come here. I understand not all of these people are bad, and many are running for their lives from even worse places in the world such as South America and the war-torn Middle East.
I just don’t understand what “Washington” is thinking about or what they are doing. There are people like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who are running for president. Both who are terrible choices for our country, and both have billions together for campaigning, but yet kids are starving and veterans are homeless. People are unemployed.
Then I think about slavery. Slaves and slavery were abolished in America, but what do you call the American Prison system? You have hundreds of thousands of prisoners across our country, and we are forced to work in prison in many different jobs. From the license plate factory to uniforms for military and office equipment for state offices, we get paid next to nothing! $9, $16, $22 a month, for as much as 16 hours a day for 7 days a week. If you refuse to perform your work duties, they write you tickets and put you on different restrictions. So ask yourself, is slavery really over? Clearly the answer is no! For a man or woman who “broke the law” to work these hours and not receive enough money to pay for basic hygiene items is wrong. Then people say well, it offsets what you don’t pay for (food, electricity). Living in prison teaches you nothing about being a successful member of society.
With everything going on around me, I want to hide my eyes so I don’t see it."

This book was different. Large sheets filled with minute hand scripts in two columns were held by clear, plastic slipcovers. Three large, three-ring clamps were screwed to the wooden binding. She read the opened page, the last entry of the journal dated almost 600 years ago. It said, “Today, IASHSTIEM passed into the Summerland. Per his final wishes, I (Trisha Lanaghan, his homecare nurse) typed this final entry, printed it up, and placed in into his Book. He died peacefully at 119, surrounded by three generations of his family. His final words were, ‘It’s time. I love you all.’ He will be missed.”
An electric thrill went down Irceja’s spine. If this really was the Book of Shadows, it was worth more than all of the books on the shelves combined because as legend says, it contained the true knowledge of all magic.
For a moment, she wondered how it came to rest in a hidden section of her family’s library, until something caught her eye. There was a small cloth bag with feathered drawstrings lying at the edge of the pages. Irceja picked it up and carefully opened it. Inside were two small feathers, a stone, a seed, and four small wooden slats, and other small items. She returned it because she knew not to mess with magical objects without fully understanding them. However, on a whim, she closed the Book and carried it to her room.
After many attempts and failures at school where she studied magic, she met the guardian of the threshold. He told her, “Only I can give you the keys to the realms beyond to which you seek entrance, and I won’t do that until I can see you.” He had no face, just pale smooth skin.
Irceja relaxed a bit. The book spoke of the threshold guardians, though it gave little information on how to overcome the challenge each individual one posed. “How about this?” she asked. She leaned forward and grabbed his wrist, then placed his hands over her face. He ran his hands up and down, feeling her nose and ears and tracing her lips and eyebrows.
He shook his head, “I had hoped, but I cannot see you. You may not pass.” He gave her permission to try again at another time. “I will be waiting.”
She attempted to pass the guardian several times over the next week, but nothing worked. She even tried to simply slip away, but as she turned, he was in front of her with his hands outstretched to stop her. He shook his head, “Many who have come before me have tried that, but it does not work. I know you are there, but I cannot see you. You may not pass until I see you.”
That night, she had a dream that he chased her with his hands outstretched, demanding that she give him her eyes. As the guardian was placing her eyes in his head, his palms were flat against the smooth expanse where his face should be.
When she woke up, she wasn’t left with a nightmare but with an idea. Thinking about the books fleshed out her ideas more, and she studied even when she met with him again. He waited patiently before she finally put the book aside and reached for a make-up kit.
Instructing the guardian to put his hands over his non-existent face, she began to draw a face on the back of his hands. She felt the hands were key to this: every time he stopped her, he did it by holding out his hands. Therefore she needed to occupy them somehow. The instructions on drawing realistic faces from the book translated directly into skill. She saved the eyes for last, spending the most time with them and adding the most detail.
Once she finished, the face took on additional depth. The eyes sparkled, and the mouth moved in a slight smile. Irceja couldn’t tell if the effect was achieved by some subtle motion of his hands, or if the drawing really became his face. In any case, it didn’t matter.
“I see you, young wizard-to-be. You may now pass.”"

He’s the biggest reason I was able to graduate high school. He was the brain for us both. I wasn’t stupid, though. Not in the slightest. I simply chose to focus on things other than school. I was always obsessed (or so Jerry said) with people’s faces, but it began to go beyond that. When I found a face that fascinated me, it was all I could think about. I wanted to be that person. I wanted to know how it felt to be in their world.
The first time I killed someone, it was accidental. I was twenty-three years old when I met a man at a supermarket. His face was what caught my eye, so I struck up a conversation with him. Most people will tell you their whole life story if you give them the chance. I found out that he worked at home and lived alone. I was living in an apartment with Jerry and two other people. I was working a hectic job that required a lot of interaction with others. I began wondering what it would be like to live in such peace. I followed the guy home, made my way into his house, and tied him up in his basement. How was I to know he was severely diabetic? I just wanted to be him for a little while.
Jerry did what he always did - he kept me out of trouble. When someone placed me at the scene of the crime, he was my alibi. At that point, our parents were both gone, and Jerry was in medical school. He felt I was having an identity crisis, but I disagree. I know who I am, I always have, but I want to know how it feels to be someone else.
It has been thirty-two years since that day at the supermarket. I have lived a full life - fifty-eight of them, to be exact. It is no longer enough to take over a person’s entire existence. I want to really be that person.
They call me the faceless identity killer. They say that the crime is always the same, but the description of the face of their suspect is always different. The gender changes from male to female. I really have them stumped. Boy, am I glad Jerry decided to be a plastic surgeon!
The face you see on my hands remains the same. It’s the face I share with Jerry. I had it put on my hands so I will never forget who I really am. It’s the face beneath that will change as the life I decide to live changes.
Today, I am Sam, a computer programmer from Brooklyn. I have a dog named Lucy and a best friend named Jerry.
Tomorrow, I just may be you."

The above took place not in 2016 but in 2416. The narrator is not in prison, although we can all relate to be sure. Violence and hate made Earth a wasteland from nuclear winter which forced the human race to live in the orbits. As all hell broke loose, the only ones to survive were the ones who saw the writing on the wall and evacuated in space vessels. Over two generations, they were able to link their vessels in a makeshift space station.

Now imagine that prison life was all life. No wide open spaces. No trees or grass. Terrorism, both foreign and domestic. Violence because someone believes in a different “sky person” than you. Hell, violence for entertainment or even for the sake of violence. Violence because someone has a different colored sin or loves someone of the same sex.
Is this future really far-fetched? “Be kind to one another,” Ellen Degeneres said."

Looking back, Deanna saw the sporadic lights of the farmhouses recede into the dusk of early evening. In the following days, they trudged across drainages Charles named for the twins. The forests, however, were silent. Large trees, ancient beyond memory, appeared in greater numbers, arching high overhead and blocking out the days’ sunlight. The surrounding environment revealed deep recesses of dimly-perceived paths winding away into the underbrush.
Over a slope into the mountains and down, they rode into and across a lushly-vegetated valley with a broad stream that ran along its bottom. Fish darted away from the horse hooves. A deer raised its head, hesitated, then bounded off into the forest and was closely followed by its dappled fawn that was hidden in the tall grass. A handful of birds were in the surrounding trees or on the ground, pecking for the elusive worm. The trail cut off through stands of oak, pine, and hickory. Shards of sunlight filtered through the canopy, impaling their surrounds with light arrows. Deep among the trees, no light shined through, and in the green shadows thick with underbrush, saplings struggled to grow. The temperature continues to drop, but now the colder air had a crisp, clean taste refreshing to the Twins.
On the last day, the darker the ground, the narrower the way. A twist to the right, a widening of the way. They rose over a saddleback, around a bald-headed, snow-encrusted peak, and down the other side, moving into and out of the snow zone. They finally emerged northeast of the Twins River, and then they passed through a small cut and onto the Academy plateau.
Stopping just inside the clearing, they saw the oak, pine, aspen, and birch all around the fringes of a long, flat valley. In the middle, there were verdant grasses, shrubs, flowers, trees… and buildings of all kinds and sizes with empty courtyards and an archery range.
Pointing to a large, semi-fortress looking building, Charles tells them, “Welcome to the Academy of Twins. Your new home, ladies.”"

“It’s beautiful. Really it is. I’m just a little car sick.” Holding her stomach and looking out the window she asked, “Should we be so close to the edge?”
“Ya. It’s fine. The boys know not to play too close. Besides, Dad brought me here when I was younger than they are, and I turned out fine.” She didn’t look convinced so I added, “And we are setting up way over there, by the park benches.” I pointed over to the tree line.
“Alright. Everybody out. Let’s get some pictures, then setup the tents.”
The boys jumped out and ran around the car while Jen and I unpacked. The cool pine scented air cleared my head and renewed my determination for this trip. I took out my digital camera and took scenic pictures of the mountains stubbled with giant trees and the river thousands of feet below.
“Ok. Jen, take the boys, and stand over there so I can get Half Dome in the background.”
“Come here boys. Stay close,” she told them.
“Mommy can we have some s'mores?’ asked Tommy.
“Yes, yes, yes, I already told you a million times in the car.” She smiled and punched his nose.
“How are you baby boy?” she then asked Robbie. “Your tummy still hurt?”
He was two years younger than his brother of six, and like his mom, he didn’t do well with motion or altitude sickness. He nodded his head and held his stomach.
Robby said, “Mommy, I don't like this.”
“Boys get close to Mommy. No, robbie stand by your brother. Now scoot back further. A few more steps..”
“Daniel we’re already too close. Just take the damn picture.”
She was aggravated and I couldn’t blame her. It wasn’t her idea of a vacation; it was mine. She wanted hot beaches, sand, sunblock and any icy margarita.
“Everybody smile.” I took a few pictures then joined them. I put my arm around Jen’s shoulder to turn her around so she could appreciate the view.
I told her. “You know I love you, right?” Before she could respond, I pushed her out over the edge, where the ground ceased and the sky began. Other than the brief flap of her arms, she went without resistance. I was surprised really. She didn’t even make a sound, not even an involuntary yelp.
Then I looked down at the boys who's tood there alternating looks over the edge with looks at me. Their eyes wide and blue as the sky. I picked Robbie up and kicked Tommy in the back. A glancing blow that half turned him as he joined his mother over the edge. I could see the disbelief on his face, but it only lasted a moment before he was out of sight too. Still holding Robbie, I held him eye level.
“Your mommy and brother had a real bad accident, didn't they?” I said. He nodded his head in response.
“It was close, but I knew you were a keeper, just like Daddy was. Grampa would be very proud.”"

I want to protect you. It’s my responsibility.” The unlikely duo continued on.
The small girl, becoming weary after a time, began to complain, “Why do we have to go through the valley? Why do we have to go through the hard parts? I’m getting tired, and I’m hungry.”
The man looked lovingly upon her and reached out his hand toward her, “Here. I have some fruit for you to eat; it will fill you an give you strength.” The girl quickly took the fruit and began to devour it. “Don’t eat it so quickly,” the man advised. “Take your time and savor it, one bite at a time… Enjoy it as the gift that it is.” The girl looked up with gratitude for this man...but also with confusion. He wasn’t eating. He had to be hungry and tired, too. Why would he give her the only food that he had? Her hunger overcame her curiosity and confusion, and she quickly focused her thoughts back on the delicious fruit. With a meaningful, yet quick “thank you,” the child placed her hand back in his, and they continued on their path.
Before long, the girl began to complain again. “I’m not hungry anymore, but I am tired,” she whined. With no thought to himself or to his trouble along the hard journey, the man lifted the girl into his arms and began to carry her. She was almost too amazed to speak! No one had ever lifted and carried her in this way before No one had ever taken her burdens and placed them on their own back. This must be a really good man that found her lost in the wilderness. She nestled into his arms and again, meaningfully yet quickly, offered a simple “thank you.”
The young girl drifted off in her rescuer’s strong arms, somehow certain that she was safe and that he was indeed strong enough to carry her safely through the valley. As dark began to creep upon them, she quickly woke, fearful of the night sky pressing down upon them. She too quickly forgot the assurance and comfort he offered her. Knowing her thoughts before she spoke them, the man asked, “Is something wrong?”
Shivering against him, she whispered, “I’m afraid.”
The man pulled her closer to him and softly spoke, “What is it that you are afraid of, child?”
Clinging tightly, the girl began a long list of her fears, “I’m afraid of the dark. And the animals that come out at night. And the night bugs. And being alone. Most of all, I’m afraid that you will get tired and leave me here by myself.”
Stopping, the man sat down and held the girl tightly in his lap. He lovingly caressed her hair as he softly spoke, “Listen to me, child. We need the dark. We need the night sky so that we can enjoy the millions of beautiful stars above. Do you see them? Each one has a place of its own in the heavens above. And why fear the animals? They are only doing what they were created and designed to do. They come out at night with a purpose, child. And as for me, I will never leave you. I will never forsake you. You will never be lost and left alone in the wilderness so long as you continue to cling and cleave to me.”
The man rose, continuing to carry the girl. With her fears seemingly at rest once more, they began on their way again. The pair travelled for many days and nights before they finally made it through the valley and up onto a beautiful mountain top. The view was glorious! The young girl looked around and saw beauty like she had never seen before. Saw it in a new way, with a clean and fresh vision. She saw that her destination was just a short ways ahead, and she began to run. Just as quickly as she began, se stopped and spun around, seeking her rescuer’s face. “Aren’t you coming with me? Don’t you want us to stay together?”
Walking slowly toward her, the man reached out his hand and took her’s once more in his as he explained, “My child, I have always been and always will be with you. You are my child, and I am your Father. In the valley, on the mountain, and every place in between, I am with you. Even when you can’t see me, I am with you. Remember to cling to me, listen to my voice, and know that I am the Lord, your God. I will never leave or forsake you. Those words I spoke to you were true in the valley, and they will always be true.” As the Savior released her hand, she felt tears of true and deep love and gratitude spill from her eyes. She knew what He said was true. She had never been alone, and she never would be. Meaningfully, with all of her heart, mind, and soul, she smiled and whispered, “Thank you.”"

The drone was also capable of instantly killing them, as they had witnessed when the drone silently killed their wolf-collie mix dog, Tooth. When a man, who removed his bracelet and fled his assigned quadrant, shot at the drone with a rifle, the drone silently killed that man, too, with what must have been an invisible “death” ray. Several minutes after each execution, another, larger rone appeared and removed the corpses.
Everything changed in the summer of 2021 when a meteorite crashed into the mid-Pacific. An unremarkable tidal wave and damage to the ocean’s ecology resulted, but life on land and human society was otherwise intact, or so it seemed.
A month after the meteorite’s impact, all of the world’s electrical infrastructure simultaneously collapsed. The last T.V. broadcast Mark and his wife Anne heard on T.V. was that the world’s electrical systems were under attack by… then the signal cut off. Mark and Anne watched as their own electronics became covered by sparkling, moving dust that swelled as it consumed the metallic, electrical parts in their phones, radios, T.V., and even calculators, watchers, and Anne’s pacemaker.
Mark watched Anne die.
Hours later, what he dubbed a reaper drone came and collected Anne’s body, while baby Erick blissfully slept.
Whenever Mark recalled that day, an overwhelming, difficult to explain wave of emotion washed through him, leaving him empty, as if he had a soul that was freshly ripped out.
It’d been 8 years since the day Anne died, and the New Ones--what the drones called their masters--had steadily stripped Earth of its flora and fauna. Even topsoil had been scraped up. Where it all went, Mark didn’t know and couldn’t see from his designated quadrant. What was left was burned black by what looked like a broad, concentrated beam of sunlight that came out of the sky.
The New Ones were intent on wiping all life from Earth, and there was nothing that Mark could do about it. As far as he knew, no one could do anything about it. In the back of his mind, Mark knew that Erick and he would be carried off by a reaper drone. It was the “when” that Mark didn’t know. Until then, the tiny, diminishing hope that somehow the planet would be saved kept him going through the motions.
Is this how the American Indians helt? Mark wondered as he thought of European conquest of the Americas.
On the way back to what was left of their house, Erick asked another question. “Will it ever be that way again?”
“Sure. Sure,” Mark robotically answered, and then described fantastic images of what the world’s salvation would look like, far different than what the Earth would look like in real…life?"

That’s on you. Take what goes with that, though. You understand? You keep on buckin’, and you can’t get into Diagonal Taboo. The lightning bolts will come, and the Winter Hawk gets you. That’s what goes with being a hardhead.
Diagonal Taboo is the same size as my prison cell. Maybe yours is smaller, but we’ve got the Michael-type unit. Diagonal Taboo is named such because the door is a parody of the European road sign with the red circle and three diagonal slashes, meaning “entry forbidden.” Diagonal Taboo is...I don’t know...a dimensional transfer point. Yeah? You don’t believe in other dimensions, huh? Me neither. I’m in my cell on Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit in Amarillo. You’re in your cell, whichever prison you’re in. But here we are. We are both looking at this PE photo theme, somewhere neither of us have been. Now here you are, in my cell with me, although you aren’t. You came past Shoe Rock with me, though you didn’t. Your hard headed self struggled to get through the slash of Diagonal Taboo, though you didn’t realize it. You needn’t believe in other dimensions: it is what it is, believe it or not. Diagonal Taboo is a dimension transfer point, and PE brought you out of your cell, through the alpine valley photo, and into my cell. That’s my best explanation.

“The reason why I brought these items,” Lt. Nevils says, “is because the officer I interviewed gave me the same story. Every time they will do their security check, they would see Offender Joe just laying on his bed, staring at the picture. And when they will come around on their second round, Offender Joe will be in the same position, staring at the picture. Now here’s the weird part: when I interviewed Officer J.D., he told me that Joe will always be studying the Word and reciting Rev. 3:8. Now, if you open in Rev. 3:8, you will notice scriptures written next to it.” The warden examined Rev. 3:8 and also noticed John 10:9, Rev. 3:20, Proverb 8:33-36, and Luke 11:9-10. “Here’s the thing, Warden,” the lieutenant interrupts the warden’s thinking. “They all lead to a door.”
“You know what I found odd, strange, and weird, Lieutenant?!” Lt. Nevils steps back a little, sensing another one of his famous outbursts. “How can an inmate escape from a high security prison?! Especially when he is locked within a cell, and all you can tell me is that you found a picture and a Bible?! I have Huntsville and the Governor up my ass, wanting questions.”
Boom! Boom! Both the warden and the lieutenant jump and face the door. “Who the hell is banging at my door?!” The warden screams. A scrawny person enters the office: he is short with red hair and big classes, making his eyes 2 times bigger. “What the hell do you want, Officer Redwood?!” The warden roars.
Officer Redwood cringes when his name was yelled and moves a little forward, “We found something.”
The warden jumps out of his seat and yells, “You found him!”
“No, sir. We found a letter,” Officer Redwood says.
“A letter,” the warden repeats.
“Yes, sir. A letter addressed to you,” the officer answers. He leans over to hand over the letter, and then he immediately leaves the office. The warden begins to read the letter:
“If you are reading this letter, Warden, I wanted to let you know that when I first arrived at your facility, I truly felt evil within this prison. A good friend of mine once told me that prison is a seed of destruction to the people who fall victim to its ways. Prison also takes away hope, joy, and life. The only thing it can’t take away is the soul, the spirit, and God’s love. The Word of God helped me open new doors. Look at me--I’m gone! I successfully passed through into a beautiful world, a realm that many have been trying to destroy for so long. But yet, it still stands true, tall, and majestic in its own way. You are probably saying bullcrap! To you, it might be because you will never understand. When I read Rev. 3:8, I was determined: I put all my strength, meditation, and prayers into a small picture I posted against the wall. For days, I stared at the picture, seeing myself walking at the base of the mountain and gazing at the creation of our Creator. How the clouds blended with the blue skies, and the sun shines through, caressing the mountain with its touch and illuminating the snow-covered peaks. After a while of meditation and patience, I was able to walk through the forest. I felt truly alive and free. It is an awesome experience to leave your little hotel to a home of peace.
“You could either believe or keep on searching, but you will never find me. The only thing I could tell you, Warden, for your own good is that time is getting near. You need to make a decision with your life. Joshua said, ‘Choose for yourself this day whom you will serve.’ It’s time to let go of the flesh ways because we put a lot of effort in this human flesh. The Word tells us that the things that are seen are only temporary, but the things that aren’t seen are eternal. You are probably saying bullshit! To you, it might be bull because you’re still subjected to the regulations and principles of the world. ‘Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle, blinding you from the truth because of your blindness, you will never understand.’ Take care and keep your head up.”
The lieutenant grabs the picture and looks closely, and he spots him--Joe--walking along side with someone else. The lieutenant’s heart beats rapidly and yells, “Warden!”
“What do you want, Lieutenant?” The warden yells back.
The lieutenant pauses, realizing what he was about to do. He decides to keep it to himself. “I just want to know what you want me to do with these items,” the lieutenant says.
“I don’t care. Throw them away and get out of my office,” the warden replies.
The lieutenant steps out of the office and out of the building and looks up to the sky. He says, “I’ll be joining you pretty soon, Joe, because I believe. I see the truth written in this creation. The lieutenant smiles and pushes forward."

Over the centuries, tens of thousands of warriors carved the rune, Tyr’s rune, into their weapons. The families of these warriors prayed to Tyr and made sacrifices to him, as did the warriors themselves.
It may be years before I am able to find and dig through the rubble. And possibly more years to find the correct tunnel and correct room. Possibly just to be killed by the deadly and most powerful Fenris Wolf, the beast who sensed a trap as the gods challenged him to test his strength against bindings.
The first time, the monster broke free. The third time, Fenris grew suspicious and said the only way he’d test his strength for a third time was if one of the gods would place their hand in his mouth. None stepped forward except Tyr, the only one who was fearless and willing to sacrifice so much to protect Asgard. None other than Tyr would feed the Fenris Wolf either.
Personally, I believe that after the Fenris Wolf was imprisoned, he regurgitated the hand of the mighty war god to look at and comfort himself, knowing the gods didn’t walk away from and encounter him unscathed. I admire it in the dark and damp depths of his confinements as one would admire a hard earned trophy. I, however, have no fantasies about the guns and knives I carry, being able to kill or even ward off the Fenris Wolf. I bear these weapons to protect myself from predators of the wilderness and to kill anyone who may try to kill me or try to stop me.
I will leave the wolf bound and out of respect, I’ll leave Tyr’s hand there. I worry officials may try to claim it and place it in a museum to feed their green driven by monetary goals and reputation. If I knew how to return it to Tyr, that seems most appropriate. Maybe, as I continue my journey, a way to achieve this may reveal itself. But for now, with felicity, I’ll begin to search these beautiful mountains, the final location to which the stone slab has directed me."

It was then that I noticed he’d shaved his head. He was right though. The short sections of chain and rope would be of little use alone. Keys jangles as the guards came to wrangle all of us fighters.
We were on the bus a mere forty-five minutes when we veered onto a dirt road. One bus and another group of vans followed us, while the other buses continues on the blacktop. From the map I remembered that they were going to the other point of entry. One hundred twenty five inmates would be at each point. Suddenly we jerked to a stop, and the old doors squeaked open. We empties off the bus into the dusty parking area.
We were lined up shoulder-to-shoulder along the ridge when a trio of guards approached Dave and escorted him behind our bus for a search. He returned about five minutes later, visibly disgruntled, to his spot in line. No one known when it would be time to go, but after four eardrum shattering beeps and a shotgun blast, everyone just sort of ran into the unknown. Right away the guys on our left lost their footing and began to tumble down the hill. One lost his boots while the other dropped his section of chain. I picked it up, and we ran past them before they had realized.
Men’s creams could be heard along the entire hillside. Rattling chains and shouts of agony and injury echoed through the treetops, growing faint. Suddenly it occurred to me that we weren’t going anywhere near where we were supposed to be. I stopped, and Dave nearly ran into me. “Where the hell are you sending me,” I asked him. I was getting angry thinking someone that I thought was my friend was essentially leading me back to prison.
“Okay, just listen,” he said. “They’re all positioned together, and we’re going right through them.” I was confused, but joined Dave on the ground. He stuck the blade at a rather obscure angle and passed out right there beside me. Without a second though, I grabbed the knife, finished the cut and reached into pull out the device. I quickly put the gauze on it and wrapped the leg once with the tape. Then I cut my own skin and pulled it out. I used the leftover tape and wrapped my leg. Dave came to and said he couldn’t feel his leg. I had no idea where to go and Dave was nodding out again.
“Smoke screen” was all he said. I looked behind us and saw smoke rising. I put my mask on, threw Dave over my shoulder and headed for the hills. My adrenaline was high of Dave was lighter than I’d thought. Today we share a six-room cabin in Pennsylvania. The fight ring was illegal anyway, and no one ever looking for us.

During the winter, we get real heavy snowstorms, sometimes even with lightning and thunder. As I watch the storms, I often think about the poor suckers who have to drive in it. And while I feel bad for them I’m just glad it’s not me.
I wonder what kind of wildlife lives in the area where this picture was taken. Depending on the region of the world, I’m sure there are raccoons, skunks, of course squirrels, maybe bears, or big cats. There may be some mountain goats--I’m sure there are eagles, along with other birds.
I would really like to go camping and hiking in an area like that. I used to enjoy camping, hiking, mountain biking, and other stuff like that. But that was another life ago. Now, the closest I can get to camping is taking a nap on the baseball field at yard. No more hiking or mountain biking. Those things will definitely live on in my memories though."

The tears gushed like water from a broken dam, smashing the mask of calmness he’d been wearing for the past week. It just wasn’t right! Briefly, he thought about his SUV, abandoned on the side of the road at the bottom of the hill. He’d been on his way to the funeral when--before he realized what he was doing--he’d pulled along the side of the road. It was the same road where Christian taught him to drive; he picked it because it was away from the city. “This way, you can’t run nobody off the road and have both of our asses in jail on some vehicular manslaughter,” Christian joked as he directed Martin.
That was the sense of humor he had; it was the kind that always infused everything with levity.
Outside the SUV, Martin stood besides the road awhile with both eyes fixed upon the expansive mountains ahead. He’d always wanted to hike those hills, a desire rekindled every time he passed by them. Well, there’s no time like the present. Better enjoy each day before you’re killed by an officer for reaching to scratch your face too fast, he thought before bolting for the mountains. That was twenty minutes ago.
Now, with the strength returning to his knees, he pushed off the rock and continued up the trail and away from the road and his car, away from the funeral and the eulogy he was supposed to give.
Although he agreed to give the eulogy, he wasn’t prepared because nobody should be giving a eulogy about his cousin. Christian should be alive! Alive and breathing, raising his kids and enjoying his family.
Already, the media had started--doing what it always did--laying the groundwork for the cop to evade accountability. Already, the major networks were tarnishing his cousin’s character in their nightly broadcasts. Some were pictures, from his Facebook page, of his holding a joint, and another one was of Malcolm X. Suddenly, Christian was a weed smoking radical. As if they, themselves, haven’t smoked on a few “dobbies” in college. Only when black males are killed by the police is the family called upon to defend the victim’s honor. (Apparently, black men are judged on a different scale. No rapid movements, and fight for your right not to be shot down like a rabid dog in the streets.) Only one network vaguely alluded to the fact that Christian was a college graduate. “There’s some indication that the victim may have attended college,” they muttered, as if that was some unsubstantiated rumor they couldn’t confirm.
And as always the case, after about a month of more biased coverage, the protest will die down and the grand jury won’t indict the officer. The subsequent “Department of Justice” investigation will find no rights violation, and that’ll be it. Another nigger dead. Oh well, please pass the salt. The American “just us” system: like it or shut up!
At the mountain’s peak, he stood for a while, gazing at the vast terrain. A lone mountain, peppered with snow, loomed off in the distance. The odd thing was that it wasn’t even close to winter. Up above, the clouds lingered and drooped. From this vantage point, the view emoted a mystical presence. The mountains, laid below, ruffled like a wrinkled bed cover and created zagged regions of valleys. He followed a trail, through the shadowy alpines, and down the hill. All around, the tree stems were strong and wide, tall and reaching far into the heavens. The fallen leaves formed a carpet beneath his boots. They crunched as he walked.
“Damn, Christian. We were supposed to grow old together,” he mumbled to the trees, as if his cousin’s soul lurked behind a thick stem.
Ironically, Christian was the most cautious person he knew, always warning them to “watch out, out here. A nigga gotta literally hide from these streets.” And hide he did. That boy must’ve spent a third of his high school years in the library. If you needed to speak to Christian, you knew where to find him: back corner of the library in front of the sad collection of “black literature.”
“Double curriculum” he called it. First was the one the school crammed down your throat. That Eurocentric narrative that purports that Europeans started everything and conquered all. The bogus “facts” you regurgitate back to them on exams to earn a degree for that job.
Then there’s the real narrative in which you discover that despite what the “textbook” says, Egyptians weren’t white and astrology, philosophy, and the sciences attributed to the Greeks were really started by blacks thousands of years before whites descended out of the Caucus Mountains.
“So while you write Pythagoras and Aristotle as the fathers of philosophy, you pretend to not know about Ptahhotep or Imhotep, or that they themselves openly admit to learning at the feet of black men.” His cousin would go on like this for hours, proclaiming the truth like John the Baptist by the Jordan River. And that’s when he was sober. Put some weed in Christian, and it was ten times worse: his why-do-they-hate-us speech and what-have-we-ever-done-to-them speech would always start with sporadic comments between puffs and coughs. Then, as the weed kicked in, he’d kick into high gear: “they’ve been hating on us since before the Christian era when the Hyksos then the Assyrian encroached into Egypt. So we migrate south and let them have the damn place?” Martin would ask, “We?” because he knew that would irk him. “Who? Nigga, we black folks. Anyway, then again in the fifteenth century, when we had one of the most established regions in Mali, Songhai, and Ghana. And here they come again, doing us so bad with that slavery shit. Did you know that they threw so many black people overboard that the sharks in the Atlantic Ocean altered their yearly migratory route, following the free food of black bodies? Man, somebody take this blunt before I start singing negro spirituals in this bitch.”
Martin chuckled at the memory, just as he discovered a stream through the thick trees. He sat on a rock by the water and began to think of Christian, police brutality, and the black man’s reality in this country, a place publicized as the “land of the free” and never adding “unless you’re black then no rapid movements, nigger.”
The sound of crunching leaves pulled him out of his reverie, and a white man with long hair and a beard wore sandals and a tie-dyed shirt. A chain of black rope and sea shells rested atop his bright, multi-colored shirt. His frame was skinny but tall. As if feeling Martin’s presence, the man slowly turned toward him and acknowledge him with a nodd. Navigating toward the rock, the man said, “What’s up, bro? Didn’t expect anybody else here.” Martin simply nodded. The feeling was mutual, but he felt his solitude encroached.
Methodically, he dug a pouch out from his pocket then pulled out a joint. After inspecting it, he took a lighter out and sparked it. “Yeah, bro. I absolutely love this spot. Smoke?” he asked as he extended the joint toward Martin.
Silently, Martin accepted the gift and inhaled it a few times. “Yeah, bro. This is my meditation spot. There are mystical powers in the mountains.” After retrieving the joint and taking a massive hit, he resumed, “Yeah, dude. All the prophets, Moses, Elijah, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, knew about the power of the mountains. The Bhagavad Gita, even, expounds on it as one of the prerequisites to attaining enlightenment.” He passed the joint, but this time, he reached into his pouch for a second joint to light up. “Yeah, bro. The ancient knowledge of the Gods is around us.” He looked around, as if trailing the knowledge with his eyes. “Know what I mean, bro?
“Sure,” Martin responded as the weed slowly eased his apprehension.
“Yeah, bro. They all received their divine orders in the mountains which call out to the chosen. Awesome.”
He said nothing for a while as they both listened to nature’s voice, whispering all around them. “Well, brother. I’m going to continue my walk. It was very nice to meet ya, and don’t forget:
bring about the change you want.” Martin accepted the extended hand.
“Alright. God bless,” Martin said as the strange man continued along the stream. With renewed vigor, Martin hopped off the rock, ready to traverse the large mountains and be on his way."

Hyenas preyed on the weak and those stupid enough to think they could outlast nature’s fury. Thousands of lives were put to the toil to eke out an existence for the privileged few in the barren wastelands. They were put in chains and staked out in the desert, made to dig holes searching for water or to cultivate gardens of the few surviving desert plants.
Every now and then, one would get it in its head to shake off its leash and run. And that’s where I would come in, sent to retrieve those that escaped. Most of the time, it wasn’t hard to do. A starving bag of bones can’t get very far out in the wastelands without any water and dragging chains. Usually, you could find them the next morning a few miles away, dead.
But the last time, no. The last time was different.
He (I told you it was a he, not that it really mattered much) was staked three days out into the wastelands. Late teens, brown hair, brown eyes, nothing special about him. I figured he shouldn’t be too hard to find, especially because not too many guys walked around the wastelands dragging a chain around their neck. Go out, find him, bring him back (preferably alive). Just another job.
I got my gear and set out on a 450cc Honda 4-stroke dirt bike with an extra gallon of gas. Finding gas wasn’t hard: all the old gas station tanks underground were close to full, and a map of how things were before the disasters showed where to find all the stations. I also had a tent to keep sun the off me during the day, a mask to filter out the ash and dust, a double barrel shotgun with plenty of ammo, and most importantly, a week’s worth of water.
I opened the throttle wide and rushed out to where they said he had been staked. I could waste fuel on this run because of plenty of stations in between. Time and water, though, were my enemies. They said they wanted him alive, but there’s not much chance of that if he’s wandering the wasteland on his own for three days. The bike ate up the ground, carving a trail throughout the mounds of ash. Stopping only for short breaks or a quick nap, I managed to make a three day trip in 36 hours.
I spent the next six days looking for him. At first, it was easy given the clear tracks in the ash and sand to follow. I had seen only one set of footprints leading away from the stake, which had to be his, and I figured he was carrying the chain. However, the second day out, the winds blew a wall of dust and ash high enough to block out the sun for hours and erased everything on the ground. His tracks wandered back and forth but always headed east. When the winds died away, I set out opposite the setting sun, hoping to see signs.
Three days later, I picked up his trail again. I don’t know how he managed it: after the dust storm, I had to ration my water. He had gone seven days with what little he had saved or the little he managed to find. The chain around his neck must have grown too heavy to carry anymore, but the trail it left, dragging behind him, was a road beckoning to me.
I found him the next morning, and to make sure it wasn’t easy for me, he managed to make it into another gang’s territory. And that is why I always carried the shotgun. They didn’t give me any trouble because it’s not worth it for a run away, especially one half dead.
My remaining water barely got us along, until we came across a watering team. I got him back alive, just as I was told. When I dumped him on the flood at their feet… laughter. You ask why they laughed. So did I.
“We bet the son could outlast his old man.”
When I tell you to go, pull on the chain and be ready to run with me."

Should he or shouldn’t he? Steve still hadn’t made up his mind as he headed into the biggest match of his career: the main event of a pay-per-view called Making America Great Again. It was to mark the rebirth of ROT. Judging by the turn-away-crowd at the Civic Center, things certainly seemed to be heading in that direction.
Would betraying his brother be worth a shot at fame? Maybe Jimmy could join him in the UWE once he got established. Then again… Wouldn’t Jimmy jump at the opportunity if it were offered to him? Steve had heard horror stories about how wrestlers had been lured to the UWE with promises of fame and fortune by UWE promoter Vince Turner, only to be dismissed due to the slightest indiscretion. ROT’s locker room was full of such sad outcasts. Then again, those guys could be just bellyaching because they’re wash-outs.
What would be worse: washing out or never getting the opportunity to begin with? Steve wondered.
The crowd was red-hot as the Border Patrol and the Soldiers of Mercy squared off in the center of the ring. They were on the verge of rioting when Donny Deuce distracted the referee while the Border Patrol worked over Jimmy.
Steve hesitated when Jimmy hot-tagged him. He waited for Jimmy to crawl up the turnbuckles and regain his balance before letting go of the tag-rope and stepping into the squared circle.
The crowd grew deadly silent when Steve kicked Jimmy in the groin and hoisted Jimmy onto his shoulders in preparation for his finishing move, Merciful Fate.
“Dammit, Steven!” Jimmy shouted, as Steve drove Jimmy into the mat, determining both of their futures..."

John, the father, had convinced Linda, his wife and mother to baby June and their twins Lindsey and Hank, that the rumors were just hype: “No authority could allow such an unwholesome way of life to exist in this age.” Little did he know of the truth.
Now you might wonder what a “wasteland” would have to offer to a vacationing family but it really is a splendid and beautiful environment to visit. Just like Death Valley in Nevada and the Utah badlands back on Earth, extreme places can have great beauty. Sitting in the Elder hot springs at night while Altara’s two moons light the sky is exquisite.
When the assault happened, the Jones family had been in the wastelands for just over a week, local time. Most assaults happen around this time frame, and they didn’t realize they were being watched for days before the thugs approached them while the Jones ate lunch.
There were four of them in all. They were a greasy but wiry looking lot. It was a weariness that carried strength despite a lack of large muscle. There was an almost feral intensity to their eyes, and they had a dangerous and lustful look as they gazed at the nervous family.
“What are you doing there?” the blond thug asked with a sneer.
“We’re… we’re travelling to the hot springs,” responded John.
“Mmm… what a beautiful family you have, the black-haired thug said, disconcertingly. All the while, they had inched closer to the family, and this is when they attacked. The poor Jones family, in their fear and nervousness, didn’t even see it coming, not that they could have done much. John was a computer technician and spent most of his time at a desk. Linda was a housewife, and the twins were barely 15 and unaccustomed to any violence.
The black-haired thug did a quick move up to John and gave him a vicious backhand to the face, sending him sprawling into the dirt. The blonde sprinted over and grabbed Lindsey with a knife in his hand.
“No!” Linda yelled as she tried to run for Lindsey. Unfortunately, the thug with piercing green eyes intercepted her with a knife in hand.
“I wouldn’t do that,” he smiled. “I might have to use this,” he noted as he brandished the knife.
Meanwhile, the last thug, the stern faced one who was obviously the leader, stood back and watched. He produced a pistol once the melee started, and once the situation was under control, he flashed a smirk. His dead eyes never showed any emotion.
This is when the shot rang out, except it wasn’t stern face who’d done the shooting. It was his chest that erupted in blood as he collapsed to the ground. It was the beginning of the thugs’ end, even though they hadn’t quite realized it yet.
“Step away from that family or follow his lead.” It was a hard-edged voice that carried authority and violent experience. The man behind the voice seemed to rise up out of the ground. He held a rifle, and even as he moved it was rock steady on each thug in turn.
You could tell his clothing was meant to blend into the environment. It was all utilitarian too. He had a sidearm at his belt and extra clips and rounds in his vest. He had sandy brown hair and slate gray eyes that never ceased moving and assessing. Every move was precise and calculated.
The thugs were nervous and uncertain now. The weasel-like calculations were going on behind their eyes. The blond thug was trying to move more behind Lindsey, hoping not to be a rifle target. The green-eyed thug backed away from Linda who sank to her knees, wracked by sobs, while the black-haired one stood confused in front of John with his hands at his sides.
Then, the blonde, trying to adjust his position, moved the knife from Lindsey’s neck. In that instant, he took a bullet to the shoulder and dropped to the ground in agony.
“On the ground, the rest of you,” came that authoritative voice. Realizing what had happened and scared of the rifle, the other two complied. They knew who this man was: he was legend and anathema to their kind. It was over.
He escorted the family to safety, and the thugs to jail. He buried their leader. The jones offered much to him, and he accepted nothing more than their thanks."

The yard wasn’t fenced in, yet the garden was bordered by arious sizes and shapes of rocks. I felt the need to take in the sight as it was calm and soothing compared to what I left behind. With my duffle bag in hand and camera strapped around my neck, I raised my left hand and knocked at the door. “Hang on! I’ll be right there!” I heard a woman’s voice call out. It sounded distant.
After a few minutes I was greeted by an elderly woman, mid-sixties maybe, wearing a turquoise and white flower print shirt and black slacks. Her hair was up in curlers, and her face was nicely tanned. Before I could say a word to her, she spotted the camera around my neck, the light in her eyes soon veiled by tears. “Come in,” she said, trying to keep from crying, “it looks like we have…” Her sentence trailed off as I followed her toward the kitchen near the back of the house.
I pulled out a chair for her, and she sank slowly into it, folding her arms and burying her face to let out her painful cries. I sat down my duffle bag, placed the camera on the table, and took a seat. Unsure of how to comfort her, I waited for her reprieve for us to talk.
A short time later, she gathered her composure enough to talk. She pulled a Kleenex from a shelf above the table, dabbed her eyes, blew her nose, and pointed at the camera and asked, “Where did you get that?”
I gave her the story on how I came across the camera with its owner, and she lost it. It seemed quite a while before she regained her composure. The pain in her eyes was deep. I said, “I can see this is hard for you. Should I come back another time?”
“No.” She said,” I needed to hear this, and now you need to hear my side of the story.” I could tell we would be there a while because this time, she took the box of Kleenex from the shelf and began telling me of her son Daryl, the photographer.
It turns out his passion was to immortalize those who may not get to tell their story. He wanted to show the world a day in the life of a soldier, whether man or woman, and the challenges walking through that day. It didn’t matter who the subject of his photo would be; all that mattered is that he caught a moment of their story. It was hard for me to contain myself after hearing that, but I’m glad I did. Now his story remains."

His parents were both at work off-satellite, so Jalen could yell any kind of language and volume. While everyone else slides in mostly straight lines, Jalen often swerves just for the hell of it, even in corridors.
It often annoys people behind him, but a neural impulse app window called Person Ahead Trajectory Holosignal (PATH) displays for others the shape of his intended direction. When Jalen slid into a “(“ after his PATH showed “)”, Brian said, “J, yo’ neuros firin’ disinfo, bro. You better scan that shit.” Brian warned his friend, mindful of the threat of head-hackterrorists who’ve been known to induce suicides and self-tortures.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Jalen droned, sliding up to the old decommissioned spacejet. Once Brian was in the passenger seat, Jalen handed him a contact lenscreen holder. “Take your lenses out, put these in, and prepare to launch!” Dej’s warning resurfaced in Brian’s mind, and to Brian’s questioning, Jalen preached, “Look, B. Just ‘cause you pussy-whipped don’t mean you gotta be a pussy, too! Besides, I uploaded a whole diagram and description in the program. Just check it out!”
The simulation was a perfect illusion. They’d surged through earth’s scorched atmosphere, but Jalen juxtaposed that with an impossibly revived, repopulated terrain sans any anti-atom bomb craters and fallout. He’d also imagined a complete Dragon Island in the South China Sea. Soaring above the skyline, casting shadow on hyperloop tubes spiraled around mile-high buildings with shifting facades, hovering over a nude beach and supathick multi-racial women in a twerk mob, their gyration frames multiplied, zoomed, slo-mo’ed and rhythmically overlaid in a 3-D montage as Brian’s high became a literal, chemical one. That’s when Jalen’s face appeared on his cockpit’s sim-screen.
“Feel that, B?” Jalen was barrel rolling the jet now, enhancing Brian’s ever-increasing disorientation.
As the imagery morphed, twisted, and blurred, Brian answered, “Yeah, man. What the fuck was that?
Laughing, Jalen explained, “The best part of this trip, B! I infused some releasers into the lenses. I found this throwback chemical ingredient for a plant-data mining earlier. It’s fire, right?”
“You what?!” Brian was still trying to process what Jalen had done when he lost consciousness.
“Why would they even want to touch down here?” a medic asked his co-worker. His voice came through his earpiece slightly muffled, filtered through a mic-equipped oxygen mask. Looking through a haze of fallout dust at the crash site victims, he ignored the question. As he lifted one of the teenage boys onto his cyber-enhanced, biohaz-suited shoulders, he posed another baffling question. “Hell, what I want to know is, how in the age of thought recognition did these two idiots mobilize a decomm’d space jet in the first place.”
“Yeah. I still can’t wrap my head around that one."

Notably, there is only one of this kind. I have dubbed it the Sufferer because it seems to suffer. This monster seems to suffer pains much more than the fates suffered by the other breeds of monsters. I could not catalogue an execution for this monster’s demonic manifestation. One thing, though, about the Sufferer that is so apparent is that it suffers as much as the prisoner Torque. I have seen Torque consumed with such fury that he seems to go through a transformation.
In his mind, I believe Torque actually turns into the Sufferer.
That may explain his ability to wreak such havoc among the monsters on the island. One wonders if this monster in Torque’s mind could completely consume him in its hatred. There have been times when this creature has ran pass me, believing I might be killed, but it would ignore me and butcher a pack of closing Slayers instead (which is why I’m lucky enough to be alive and write this entry). I have also seen just a glimpse of a huge monster on the island once, down by the docks.This monster undoubtedly had an apparatus on it that resembled the human body of the prisoner Torque.
Whatever Torque’s connection to these Hell dwellers is is uncertain, but clearly, it is Torque who will dispense them from the unmitigated psychosis of his mind.
Maybe it is an effect of the island, much like when the monsters came. But I have actually seen the prisoner Torque become so consumed with rage that he turns into this monster. I have also seen Torque become close to totally losing himself in monster. Only once he calms down does he seem to regain his human, yet dangerous, faculties. What are the monsters of Carnate Island’s conversations with Torque? This writer does not know. I also think Torque doesn’t know."

Only I felt as muzzled as he looked because even though it may have been my first war, I’d been fighting it long enough to have seen the look in his eyes. It said nothing--not me, not the enemy, not death--was going to turn him from his objective. I had him outgunned and still wasn’t fool enough to mess with that.
Without faltering or slowing, he reached the north side of camp where the fog swallowed him and his human cargo in its gossamer embrace as if welcoming them home. Almost as soon as they disappeared, I began to doubt I had even seen them. It happened so swiftly, so silently, so surreally. I know what I saw, though even if everyone else was still sound asleep and confident that I was doing my job to keep them safe.
Visibility was still crappy, but I stayed alert for anything else coming out of the south. If the chained man was being pursued, I’d handle it. In the meantime, the incident had at least given me something constructive to use my imagination on, like asking myself questions I’d probably never learn the answers to. Other than the chained man having obviously been a captive, was his pale companion a rescuer who himself ended up needing to be rescued? Was he even still alive? Where had they come from and where were they going? Why didn’t they stop and ask me for help?
Soon after the sun had burned the fog away and visibility was clear to the horizon, my relief showed up. I told her there was nothing to report, though I mentioned having a funny feeling about the southern tree line. I wasn’t going to admit I had let someone run through camp without raising an alarm or that others might follow, but I thought it best to put her on point, just in case.
On my way to chow, I at least learned the answer to the one question I needed answered more than any other. There were a set of boot tracks that cut right through the center of camp. They were fresher and deeper than all the others, realer than the others."

Luca snapped back to reality with a gasp and found himself sitting on the chrome steels tool, seeing Blue in his death throes. Luca’s eyes dart between the cell door window and his dying cellie. Dripping blood on the floor, a blood smeared toothbrush is partially stuck in Blue’s neck. The pooled blood is the color of cooked beets, and the coppery scent permeates the cell.
Luca placed his hand on Blue’s chest. Blue convulsed, a full body seizure arching his back off the mattress and his head cranking back. Air squeezed from his lungs, a hoarse bubbling release. His eyes bulged, though looking at nothing at all. Luca felt Blue’s essence go. He leaned over Blue, and their eyes were inches from each other. There is something about death and the eyes, thought Luca. Then Blue was gone and beyond Luca’s reach. Blue’s body, the shell of his ego, went slack beneath Luca’s hand.
What should have been a somber moment brought excitement to Luca. Anxiously breathing and almost slipping in the pile of blood, he dashed to the mirror. He saw himself there dozens of times a day as he paced in the cell, but now he saw power and smiled at himself. Luca knew the mind will twist to survive and that anything can become normal. He learned prisons are filled with this sort of rationale; it isn’t so much to do something awful since the awful is simply the norm.
Then Luca felt pressure on his back. His spine stiffened, and a finger of fear touched him. He turned, and Blue’s eyes caught and held him. “Don’t,” Luca replied sharply. Blue was mute, but his eyes were watching. “Don’t,” Luca said again. Blue was watching him. Luca snatched the spoon from his shelf, stepped to the head of the bed, leaned over Blue, and scooped his eyes out like poached eggs, grey matter leaking down Blue’s dead cheek as jelly tears. The ruined eyes are no longer threatening.
Tick, tick, tick goes the clock in his head. Luca travels far away in the future to the land where the clocks have no hands."

Andy didn’t share Abdul’s lofty opinion of Muslim women, but this was not the time to get drawn into a fight with his buddy. “I just wish the Donald had kept his fingers off that fucking button.” He rolled over and tried to go to sleep, but sleep wouldn’t come.
The battle was to last five hours (Andy and Abdul never believed that). Dawn came and went. Three times.
Though the tent wasn’t enough for the two, they were grateful for it. Most of the unit were sleeping under the stars. Six men occupied a small abandoned farmhouse, and briefly after settling in, the Shiites bombed it. All were presumed dead, even Bob whose screams and moans died out after about four hours.
“Did you hear that?” Andrew asked. Abdul peered through the flaps. The waxing moon casted dark shadows over an increasingly barren landscape. A small boy was throwing up. Abdul closed the flaps and turned on his lantern. “Grab your gas mask” he coughed. His eyes were watering, and his nose was running. Andrew wasn’t sure if the issuing fluid was mucus or blood.
Seventeen men and one boy about 9 years old made it to the roof of the tallest building still standing in the area. The boy was wearing Abdul’s mask. He would probably have a nasty cough for the rest of his life, but he had survived. Abdul’s eyes were glazed, and his skin was cyanotic. The issue of his nose was definitely blood.
They all survived the night. Around dawn, Andrew noticed two signs, one promising and the other portentous. The boy was staring toward the east as two dots appeared ever larger and darker over the horizon, and they seemed the source of a faint sound like that of helicopters. The other significant sensation was an acrid smoke like that of a burning building. That smell was everywhere in a city that had been under siege for four days, but it was strong and increasing. When he saw the first dark wings emerge from the stairwell, Andrew already concluded that the group would not be able to wait in their small rooftop sanctuary and be rescued.
It was the boy who devised their escape plan. The descent to street level was slow and arduous and with numerous detours due to fire, flame, or prior structural damage. Andrew carried Abdul, and the boy led them and fourteen others (one fell on the last flight of stairs and didn’t get up) to a small school playground where there was ample room for a signal fire and two helicopters.
The rescue took two trips. Abdul, the boy, and eight others went in the first flight. Andrew and five other men (one had been killed by a brief burst of gunfire, source unknown) went out an hour later.
Andrew visited Abdul in the field hospital two days later. His friend couldn’t talk much. His throat was still raw, and scar tissue was forming on his vocal cords. Andrew updated him on the status of the war. He was hopeful that it might be over within 3 or 4 years.
“The British have retaken the Golan Heights, and a report from Wikileaks says the Caliph is dead.” Abdul shook his head but said nothing. “Some Israeli troops just stormed the last known ISIS stronghold a few clicks east of here, with just a couple of dozen casualties. THey didn’t lose a single man. Seventeen wounded are in the next tent. Most of them will be going home tomorrow.”
Abdul looked at his watch. “The boy?” he asked in a throaty whisper.
“He’s behind one of those curtains. They’ll probably discharge him tomorrow.” Andrew thought Abdul would be as pleased as he was, but Abdul looked upset and agitated.
“Today,” he rasped. “Now!” He was fingering a button on his watch.
“Relax,” Andrew said, trying to comfort his friend without knowing why he was so upset. “We finally located his family. His parents are dead, but an older brother should be here in the morning.”
A small tear trickled down Abdul’s cheek. “Too late,” he said. Then he was silent, but Andy saw his lips moving in a silent prayer. Andy didn’t know when his friend last washed his hands. “Do you need some water?”
Abdul shook his head. “Too late.” He pushed the button on his watch and loud enough to be heard easily despite the painful effort, said, “Allahu akbar!” Then there was a loud explosion."

From this day on, you will be listening for even the faintest sound of need from him,” said one of the grandmothers.
While the adults were speaking once again, the wolf, or perhaps a different one, began to howl. As before, the only occupant of the house to notice was the child lying in a handmade crib, and once again, he answered in the only way that he knew. Once again, he cried.
“I guess he just can’t makeup his mind tonight,” joked the father as he started to go see his son, intending to give his wife a break.
Once again, however, before he could even get completely out of the recliner the child ceased his crying.
“Mom is this usual?” asked the new mom.
“I must confess that I have never experienced this,” answered the grandmother.
When the wolf howled again this time, more than the baby heard and listened. When the howling stopped and the baby began to cry again, this time the aged tribal shaman attuned his spirit to that of nature. Once again the mother began to go to her child and was determined to go see what was making the the child cry, even if the crying stopped.
“Don’t go to the child. He is not crying for your attention. This is a spiritual thing,” reported the shaman.
“What do you mean, father?” inquired the child’s father.
“Your son is more blessed and favored than every child is blessed and favored by the spirits. The wolf spirit is introducing your son to his wolf brothers. I have only heard of this but never experienced it in all of my years.”
“What does that mean, father? How is our son blessed and favored by the wolf spirit?”
“Your son is destined for great things. He will do much good for his people and the spirit of the wolf, the most powerful of our people’s spirits, will protect and favor him. The spirit has spoken. From this day forward your son shall be called Howling Wolf.”"

La Viajera does not forget one of her own. “Animal of acorns, are you still blind?” Your green eyes see the cold December rain in Amarillo. What does your mind’s eye see, animal of acorns? Does your mind’s eye see me speaking to you there on Bonita Colina in Puerto Rico? How is it that your mind’s eye sees so many years in the past, but it couldn't see the future years in prison? How is it that mine did see? How is it, animal of acorns?
¿Porqué está sonriendo? Espanol esta lingua
Why that smile? Spanish is a beautiful
Hermosa por chapurreando. No sabe la lingua bonita.
Language for speaking badly. I don't understand the beautiful
Te sabe? Puesto que sabe, te desafío: escriba!
Language. Do you? Since you understand, that you are
En casa de otra, y en lingua de otra, esta
Challenged; write! In the house of others, and in the
La vido por ellos dijo.
Language of others, is a life for them to say.
Escriba por Prisoner Express. Escriba con espanol
Write for Prisoner Express. Write in spanish.
Dime. Porque sonando en espanol cuando la lluvias frío
Tell me. Why do I dream in Spanish when the cold rains
Veniendo? Dime.
Are coming? Tell me.
Aye, the December 2016 Photo Essay picture tells me: “The Witch Of The Rains does not forget one of her own animals of acorns.”"

In the nine visits I took to that tent, I had not seen a single other man. Not one. There were plenty of women, women of all ages, all signs, all variety of shapes and colors. The strangest thing to me was that without exception, they were all absolutely gorgeous women. One woman had to be at least eighty years old, yet she was stunning to look at. I saw a girl of perhaps thirteen who possessed an ethereal beauty, a beauty that exuded from her every pore. Asian, African, Latina, European, all of them were luscious. Fat girls you longed to squeeze, women with enormous breast, big fat asses, long legs, skinny girls. It just didn’t matter because they were all smoking hot.
Each night fulfilled another fantasy. There was no limit to what they’d give to me without hesitation, and without judgement. It was a hedonist’s paradise, one I hadn’t even dreamed of before. Every visit seemed to be a dream later when I was at home, or at work, but whenever I returned it was all reality again.
Tonight felt different. To begin with there was nobody around. The air felt colder, and the night seemed darker. When I stepped into the tent, it went very quiet. One woman sat on the stage, just one all by herself, though she too was completely nude.
Approaching her slowly I saw that she was a tiny ancient woman, she looked so frail, I guessed her to be past one hundred years old. Her skin was covered with deep wrinkles, and age spots dotted her hands, arms, chest and neck. Her hair was thin and gray, braided with silver bells and feathers.
Her eyes… when she finally turned her head to look at me I saw her eyes were completely covered in with cataracts. She was obviously blind, yet I knew she could see me, perhaps even see me better than I saw myself. That’s what I felt anyways.
“You have given of yourself unselfishly to my ladies. For that, I thank you,” she said in a voice that rasped in a barely audible whisper. “Your seed has provided us with much needed strength, health, and vitality. Your service will be greatly rewarded. Anything your heart desire will be yours for the asking do not limit yourself with preconceived notions. Ask and it shall be given to you freely,” she croaked harshly.
I actually felt a power radiating from this tiny ancient woman, and I knew she was being sincere. “I want to be able to become invisible at will, with the ability to appear when I choose to do so.” I began, letting my imagination run wild. “I’d like to be able to stop and restart time. I’d ask to have good health and youth for at least three hundred years. The ability to change my appearance, to alter my body shape and size would be extremely valuable” I said imagining the possibilities. “Finally… I’d like to know true love,” I finished wistfully.
“Your request show wisdom,” she rasped softly. “Health and love are yours. Invisibility, time control, and shape shifting take a little longer. You will have your regards I promise you. I ask of you now to once more sate your lust on this stage. Spill your seed in this body, and all your desires are in your grasp” she said, almost pleadingly.
“Are you asking me to use you? Sexually?” I asked at a loss of how to proceed. “You are more than beautiful to me, madam,” I said honestly, “but I’m afraid I’d hurt you if I tried to pleasure you in the way I’m accustomed.”
“You have nothing to fear,” she said in her quietly raspy voice. “My body has known more than you could imagine. Take whatever you want from me, but please fill me with your seed.” She laid back and spread her legs wide, displaying an incredibly youthful vagina. It appeared to be wet, pink and tight.
I removed my clothes as she layed there watching me with her cloudy blind eyes. When I got between her legs I was overwhelmed with her fear that I was about to hurt her, but she laughed and said, “Give it to me son. I can take it I promise you.”
When I entered her, she was no longer the ancient girl creature she has been… Now she was the most incredible sex goddess in existence. Her pussy felt like heaven to me. The taste of it pumped my prick in and out of her the better it felt! The walls of her vagina squeezed my dick like a fist as I drove myself home in her hot, wet canal.
I couldn’t help myself. I was going to cum so hard I didn’t want to stop. Thrust after thrust, I spewed barrels of my sperm into her dripping cunt. Again I was amazed and shocked by the extreme volume of cum I was spurting inside her: it felt as if literal gallons of goo shot out of my cock. Each burst only pleased her that much more. To my utter astonishment, she now looked to be no better than eighteen, and more devastatingly beautiful that I thought possible. Gone were the wrinkles, the cataracts, the raspy voice, all replaced by youthful loveliness.
“Thank you, my son,” she purred like a happy kitten. “You have done far more for me than you can possibly imagine. The gifts you asked for are yours. If you should ever need me for any reason what so ever, just call out ‘mother.’ I’ll hear you and be there for you,” she said moments before she vanished from my sight in a puff of smoke.
“Well, thank you mother.” I said with a smile. I looked down at my flaccid penis and wondered what a foot long dong would look like. Before my eyes, my dick grew enormous in a matter of seconds. I had twelve inches hanging between my legs! I then imaging being invisible… I saw my body disappear! Amazing!
Life will never be the same. I can only barely imagine the possibilities."

I had traversed oceans and mountain ranges to be in this moment, to inhale this atmosphere.
Slowly, I unfurled my grip, and unrolling my fingertips, I had come to set us free from disjointedness, my one true self, separated by a constructed age of reinforcement.
Softly, like an ebbing tile, the voice rose once again pervading my skull from inside.
“Careful. Beware.” It repeated several times as I inhaled the dusky cool air deeply through my nostrils as time crept up my spine, like a knife at the base of my skull. As I stood, the seer looked up. With my numb ankles and feet haggering my stance, I watched silently as the wrinkled mottled mahogany stained skin slogged off in dry chunks that whispered into ash. As the seer’s soul rose up into the air, its illuminating sun lit the cavernous walls as I turned in a limp, examining the space around me.
Now was the time, I felt it, sharply and suddenly I jolted back my arms, welcoming, stretching my shoulder joints completely. The seer’s soul, my soul, tattered and turn so long ago, was now almost complete. The bluish bue it gave off began to flicker as it whispered to and from on the slight air current before me. I absorbed it in total, and the process long and painful. Sitting to my haunches, once again, and hanging my head with exhaustion after the feat, my soul was now complete.
I’ve rested ever since in total bliss."

I’ve even kept some of them. He cheerfully acknowledged that his eyes weren’t what they’d been twenty years before. His diminishing vision was the main reason he’d retired early (as soon as he reached 65 years old), but he assured me that he could still see things younger men could not.
My own vision was slightly impaired at that hour-tunnel vision, differently focusing, sensitivity to bright light… but I was always ready to accept a challenge when I was “under the influence.” That trait has almost got me killed more than once. (That’s one reason I don't drink anymore.)
“Close your good eye,” I said. At least I tried to. My tongue was dry and feeling fuzzy. So I may not have pronounced “close” very well. Perhaps I told him to put clothes on his eyes. Anyway, he seemed to understand.
He even put his hand over his eye. Then I realized he had closed his clear eye, the one that had been fixing me with it’s unblinking gaze. The older eye was wandering off somewhere in his left. Before I could protest, he told me what he saw.
He started with my fears and my nightmares. Then he told me about my hopes and my fondest dreams. He spoke of thoughts and feelings I’d never share with a woman much less a crazy old man.
He stripped my soul naked and left it lying on the floor. My friends say I passed out from too much whiskey and beer.
Maybe so, but sometimes I think it was my self-defense."

It was an odd looking thing, and I wanted nothing to do with it. She then goes on to explain to me the meaning of the machine, and it intrigued me. After a few demonstrations of her scanning the living room then playing it back on our television set, I decided to give it a try. It was a heavy little thing and had far too many buttons to remember. Quickly, I fell in love with the new machine. It’s not quite like my husband's old camera which only snap’s one still picture at a time. It now saddens me that we never purchased one of those video recorder machines; my family in the hills would love to see its wonders.
For the past few months, the bones I’ve been given have hurt too much to move around. Without husband here anymore, it became pointless for me to carry out the daily chores. Now I know why we bore thirteen children: if not for the love then for the help. I’m tired of laying around in bed all day. These are going to be my last days, and my visions of our world have slowly become erased. The last thing I want to remember is the ceiling in the bedroom, white, pasty, and lonely. What I do fondly remember is that damn video recorder and how I always has to close my eye to see through the machine. What a marvelous memory catcher it was.
The mind, what a crazy adventure. With the few memories of the video recorder left within me, more come flooding to life with the simple thought of having to close my eye. I need more memories. The journey outside was a tremendous trek but one that needed to be taken. Standing on my porch, back against the door to hold me up and facing the hills where I grew up, my left hand covers my left eye. The world goes black all around and only sounds of life invade my mind. My right eye opens to allow light in, and then my head begins to turn to the right, then to the left. Capturing all of the images that go by: birds flying, children playing, clouds evaporating, tree after tree dancing with the gentle breeze and then the sun warm, warm sun fills these aching bones with a few more minutes of life. Just enough time to record and remember. The right eye closes, and the video recorder is turned off. Live on, memories."

I start to gain up to him till we are side by side. The finish line is getting so close I can almost taste it. By the looks of it, it is going to be a photo finish. The other guy tries to ram into me in a desperate attempt to knock me off course and gain back the lead, but I keep my control. I try to ram him back, and now we are practically going at it like a pair of vicious Siamese twins. I have worked too hard. Once I felt him shoving into me hard, I quickly slip under him. With the absence of my force equaling his, he loses control and starts to hydroplane. I would have loved to look back to see him crash, but the rest of my life was just ahead of me.
I plummeted head first into the gamete, thrusting myself inside with such intrepid excitement. The excursion is over. I will live out the next nine months in utero. My cells transforming from zygote, embryo, fetus to newborn.
Then on the eighth month in the year of 1990, the cozy, little home I lived in my whole life will be invaded by a light that blinds me. Since my eyes are immature and incapable of seeing, a masked figure will use this chance to grab a hold of me by the back of my neck and extract me unwillingly.
The unexpected coldness of the air envelope me, and oxygen was consuming me. I kicked and squirmed to break free, but the masked man just held me suspended in air as if he was taunting me. The man brandished a large pair of sharp scissors in front of my face as another clamps my lifeline shut. Then with the gruesome looking shears, he severed me completely from my mother and my home. The room was full of smiles as I was suffering the cruel, unwanted raid. I couldn’t help but cry.
Welcome to life: this is what I won from the race nine months ago against millions of my potential sisters and brothers. I guess from that point, I began to hold some type of angst toward the world for ripping me out my comfort zone. I felt that the world owed me something, and I was going to take it at any means necessary. I resented life and gambled with it everyday, taking my winnings for granted and not understanding that I also won the lottery when I was placed in the arms of my mother.
My very first winning in life was the most important one. It paved the way for many more winnings in life to even have a possibility. Life can easily be forgotten as a reward for the strenuous feat we had to endure, just to be able to breathe the very air around us. So before you start to feel like a loser or worthless at times, remember that in a million to one, you can come out the winner."

A trail of tears of gratitude for the bison who lay down their lives so my tribe could eat and I could sew the hide into robes and tent sides. A trail of tears of thanks for a successful hunt. A trail of tears of thankfulness for the years of great abundance. A trail of tears for the seasons of lack. A trail of tears for loss as fires swept the prairie land purging it of all we worked for and in.
A trail of tears for the times of physical and spiritual purification in the sweat lodge. A trail of tears from when my people were forced from the freedom of her homeland into places that could not sustain our way of life. A trail of tears for the times the whiteman broke with us the treaty he swore to. A trail of tears for pity of those who refuse to understand we wish to live on the land our way instead of bound in identical homes.

See the pain and the sadness of loss and betrayal. Take time to wear the moccasins in which I’ve walked so many miles… miles that produced these trails of tears of which I am so proud of.

He took the paper and read what was written on it. “I suggest you give these people a call. I’ll give you a week. Then you’re out.”
Eddie looked up at his step-father then back down at the list of military recruitment offices with their addresses. He walked past him then went to his room, closed the door, and sat on his bed. No, he didn’t have a choice; it was either the mean streets of Miami or the military. No leap of faith in that.
Eddie’s life began when he moved out for boot camp. That’s when he had to start making choices and decisions on his own. A lot by guess work, a lot by trial and error. And throughout the 40 years since he moved out of his step-father’s house, he’s made more life changing decisions and choices, both good and bad, than he cared to remember. That morning, sitting in his bed and sipping his mint tea, Eddie tried to reminisce on them all.
“Faith… Faith in what? In God, Jesus, or some Higher Power? I’ve read the Bible many times, and one of the key themes is faith. Faith, God’s will, Jesus the Savior… Faith. Is it faith in myself? That I can do whatever it is that I’m destined to do? Faith that I’m capable? Faith that I can achieve? That I can survive? That I will be accepted? What about faith in whatever it is that I’m leaping into? Will it work out? Will it be acceptable to both myself and others? Will I or it be successful? Makes me think of all the years I’ve been drunk and stoned. Did I not have faith in… Whatever? Faith… HA!”’
Eddie got out of bed and got dressed. He picked up a pad of writing paper, a pencil, and a pen. Then he clipped his MP4 player to his belt and put the earbuds in his ears. He walked outside to the courtyard where he lived to sit in the sun and get some fresh air. He wanted to ponder more on this leap of faith and maybe write an essay on the subject. Sitting in the sun with a cool breeze blowing, he watched the people in the complex as they walked about and sat at tables to talk, read, or play games.
“I have faith that this essay will make sense and be good enough to be published. And writing this essay and submitting it will be my leap of faith.” Eddie said to himself then laughed. “I think a leap of faith will be something bigger than a simple essay. Something major. A life determining choice.
“Think, think. What in my life did I do that was a leap of faith? What did I do that I was frightened of, not sure of the outcome. Something that I did that was life changing?”
Then it came to him. One of the most significant life changing decisions he’s ever made. A decision, a choice, a leap of faith. He wasn’t sure of what the results would be. Eddie hasn’t had to make this leap of faith only once: he’s made this same leap of faith over and over since the year 1990.
Eddie is gay. He had always hidden his true sexuality from his family and friends. He had hidden his true sexuality though his childhood and teen years, and most challengingly, through the 12 years in the Navy and his two marriages. He lived a frustrating lie. It wasn’t until he was out of the Navy, divorced, and in college and at the age of 33 that Eddie decided to start living the life he had longed to live for so long. In 1990, he decided to take a leap of faith, the leap that those that he chose to tell of his sexuality would still accept him. No matter if they were family or friends, or just acquaintances, the faith that everything would work out for the best. And 20 years later, Eddie still takes that leap of faith. “HELLO WORLD. I’M GAY!”"

The devils also believe, and tremble; But will thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?” (James 2:19-20).
Sometimes our belief dictates an unpopular action. We say the end justifies the means. Sometimes our faith requires an apparently self destructive action. One might say, although it certainly seems less common, the means justifies the end.
We step out on faith everyday. Even the fool who calls himself an atheist or agnostic demonstrates his faith, however misplaced it might seem to me.
I knew my wife had an expensive habit. When I learned that she was using my children to finance it, I had to take drastic action. Many people believe I should have killed her, but my knowledge of the North Carolina “justice” system was incomplete. My mother wanted me to drop everything and go home. My faith didn’t allow a father to abandon his children to sadistic pedophiles. I could have taken my children somewhere in the woods or swamps and hidden, but they weren’t ready for that kind of life.
So I took a leap of faith and went to the courthouse and applied for domestic violence protection. My knowledge of the dirty, dirty South didn’t compel that result. My faith in God did.
I survived several attempts on my life and after years of struggle, won a court order for the salvation of my children. On advice of counsel, Pamela defied it. As I was getting ready to take a contempt petition to the courthouse, a corrupt cop came to my house and arrested me.
Seventeen years in prison have radically altered my beliefs about the courts and the P.I.C. not just in Carolina but throughout the U.S.A. My belief is based upon first hand observations.
If I had things to do over again, I would.
53 years ago, I sang, “I have decided to follow Jesus./ I have decided to follow Jesus./ I have decided to follow Jesus./ No turning back./ No turning back.” My belief has changed. Faith remains."

The cabinet was stuffed with the accoutrements for different worship services. Our chapel is full service, meaning it represents all of the major religious and spiritual groups, not just the ones approved by the Republican Party. One of my duties was to take care of these religious items. In short, I was to guard the materials to make sure no one was: using prayer rugs for home decor, stealing prayer and rosary beads for use as hair ornaments or beading projects, using zafus as decorative throw pillows, making the runes into scrabble tiles, drawing a moustache on our Lady of Peace, graffiting on the Sacred Heart of Jesus, shredding the Buddhist books, defacing the Quran, or obliterating the alternative religious resources. Mostly, it was the adherents of only one fundamentalist religious persuasion who felt a calling to do these kinds of things. Some of the more insistent Pentecostal type persons were anxious to tell me what “their god” has told them. Apparently, there were many gods with conflicting points of views jamming up the midnight phone lines. This is why the cabinet had a combination lock on it, and I learned to bare my teeth menacingly and moved the cabinet behind the desk.
At first, it was a struggle to not tell people what to do. After all, as a law clerk, people wanted me to make decisions for them. Now, it wasn’t my job to tell people what to do anymore; they have to make choices by themselves. Reviewing your options is what free will is all about. Ask my personal opinion, and I’ll give it. You would be surprised what worshippers come out of the woodwork once they feel there isn’t going to be any persecution about their religious preference. I liked helping them because otherwise, we’d never be able to have a conversation. I found that you don’t have to agree with those you are serving in order to be happy in the work.
The sedentary job in the law library was a lot different than my running around in the chapel. There was always something to do, papers to deliver to different departments, flyers to post, inmates to track down, and services to set. Because of limited space, some of the programs did not actually meet in the chapel but in satellite locations all around the compound. My co-workers and I were always hauling things down to these classrooms then collecting them afterwards. It was a labor of love. Service work makes you a happier person.
One day, I was helping to set up for the weekly Rosary Prayer. Carefully, I brought the statues out to a side room in the sanctuary. My co-workers were arranging the battery-powered votive candles and decorating the table with plastic plants and fruit. In walked one of the Little Sisters of Charity who occasionally came to the prison. It was Sister Glorious Savior. She walked right up and gave us hugs and pats on the shoulder, exclaiming what a beautiful presentation was set on the table. I happened to look down at Sister’s feet and noted that we were wearing the same shoes as her: humble, black Crocs.
I think no matter what leap of faith we are asked to make, faith shoes are going to be provided."

She hadn’t seen him since the 50’s. My Uncle Steve found Dan in the ‘80s, and Dan wanted to be “left alone.” Rather than hurt his mother, he told her he couldn’t find him. If Dan doesn’t want to be in the family, fine, but he can’t speak for other family members.
It’s 2003, and thank God for the internet! I discovered he was a widower and made contact with his ecstatic daughter, Alice. We made plans to meet, and 15 of my relatives including grandma flew to Alabama for the sibling reunion. During the flight, my mother whispers, “B.B., did you tell them we’re black?”
“No, they know that. Doesn’t matter,” I replied. My mother paled and notified the others. Imaginations ran wild, and in each horrible scenario, it’s my fault.
As we were getting settled in at the hotel, Alice called and said they had all been waiting downstairs for two hours. Initially, we planned to meet at a restaurant, but Alice said they were too excited. How did we walk right past them? Oh. My. God. They think we’re white. I was guilted into escorting grandma down, while the cowards waited for a report. We exited the elevator and standing in the lobby is an older, bald white man. On a closer inspection, he resembles grandma, albeit his complexion is olive toned but the green eyes are the same. A gang of at least 20 white people wearing Confederate flag hats appeared beside him. Oh Lord, what have I gotten myself into? They probably left their robes in the car. The elderly wins quickly shuffled toward each other and embraced while murmuring, “Thank God,” over and over again.
All eyes fell on me. Some said, “Thank you so much. That will be all. We can take her until the family comes down.”
I smiled, took a deep breath, and said, “I’m B.B. Before you ask, I’m not biracial: I’m black. I’m not adopted. My grandmother and your father are biracial. Is this going to be okay with you?”
Silence. Hotel clerks and guests are all staring. It’s a strange scene with me in stilettos and black business pants suit and the women in cut-off shorts and wife beaters. I couldn’t move. I thought, “At least she got a chance to see him. This was a bad idea. They hate me.” It took everything to remain there. This was when I took a leap of faith. In my Yankee accent, I reached out to my country kin and say, “Y’all, we family.”
A lady stepped forward with an extended hand. “I’m Julia, the baby girl, and if it’s not okay, don’t worry. We gonna make it okay. We family, girl.”
I didn’t realize I’d been holding my breath, and I burst into tears. I couldn’t stop looking at Julia. She looks identical to my mother. If she got a dark tan and was taller, they could pass for twins. After reporting to the cowards, half of Dan’s family left before they arrived.
“Liar!” my relatives yelled. To Dan’s credit, he offered no excuses. When asked why not just tell the truth, he replied, “Who would choose to live a hard life? You live a lie so long, it becomes the truth.”
Just as he was present when my grandma entered the world, he was there when she exited. The fat granddaughter reunited them!"

I, too, am in prison for murder, but my case was purely by accident. Of course, that doesn’t make me any better than anyone else, but I wasn’t as hardened as some other people. So I had to take a leap of faith and trust that they weren’t going to steer me in the wrong direction or take advantage of me.
For them, the leap of faith was in trusting me to not be a snitch or a child molester. They also had to trust that I would have their back when shit hit the fan and that I was a good person.
There are lots of things you do everyday that require a leap of faith, some of which you don’t even think about. For example, when you cross the street at a busy intersection, you press the button for the crosswalk signal, the traffic light stops cross traffic, and you begin to cross. You have to have faith that the cars see the light, that their car isn’t malfunctioning, and that they are able to, and in fact do, stop. That’s just one of the many examples.
The fact is that anything you do that you don’t completely control asks you to take a leap of faith and trust that the functions go properly."

I had applied for a college scholarship for ex-felons that had stayed out of prison for at least a year. The problem was that I mixed up the application deadline and turned it in two weeks late.
The sum of the scholarship was exactly 100x the amount I had given to my old high school acquaintance--crazy, huh? I begged for mercy with e-mails, phone calls, a personal visit to their office, and finally, prayer. They agreed to include the application with the others but note that it was late.
My prayers were answered, and I was blessed to receive the scholarship which financially helped me a lot. But more importantly, this experience taught me a valuable lesson: we are all beggars at some time or another, and to give is to receive.
I’m in prison again, but not for a crime I committed. I have also learned recently that my old friend has gotten his life together and is doing well with a new wife and a baby on the way. “See yourself in the eyes that you look into because your eyes are there looking back at you.”"

She prayed for me to take a leap of faith and rely on God. I argued against her, telling her that once I turn myself into Maryland Authorities, she would not see me again--that despite her belief in God, Maryland would not accept my mistake in Pennsylvania because of my long history.
Time and time again she begged me, but instead, I looked at my shortcomings in not taking care of her and our present state of need. I made a decision to provide her money through robberies I was planning before I was reincarcerated in Maryland. I could not place my faith in God.
Of course, none of my plans worked out. I never was able to send money to her and was eventually reincarcerated in Maryland for numerous felony charges. As they were being adjudicated, I went for my violation of probation where I was facing about 17 years.
I walk in the courtroom where my attorney had already worked out a plea. I was to receive only 5 years due to paperwork errors. I was stunned. I committed numerous felonies which contributed to the 5 year plea, but had I listened to Marion and taken that leap of faith, I may have ended up with far less or even reinstated on probation.
It took me a long time to admit this to her and myself. I believe that on that day, I was shown the difference between not taking a leap of faith and making my own choices.
My felonies overrode the 5 years, and my total sentence ended up to be 20 years. I never hesitate to speak about this time, and I recommend to others to take a leap of faith. In most things, I now look to my Creator who I do not specify under any specific faith. God represents all of us."

I know it and have experienced it first hand. The woman I loved was turned against me by the prying hands of the legal system, for their benefit and neither hers nor mine. I will never forget reading the surprising and scathing letter that she was coached to write for my sentencing. In it, she summated that I “did not need to be on the outside with the good citizens of the world.” Really? Is this the world we live in? A man with no record, no history of psychological issues or violence, locked away and excommunicated with no inquiry as to what went wrong, as if anything actually went wrong or truly happened for that matter. What is a good citizen anyway?
I may now e a convicted fellow, but I am comprised of the same traits that we all collectively possess. We are all capable of greatness, and we are all capable of great missteps into disaster. “Good citizens,” huh? I’ll give you “free” citizens in comparison to me because no one is complete good...or perfect. Chaos has not ceased in the world because of my imprisonment or that of any one of my peers. I honestly fear the outside world more than I do my cell. This country--this world--is going mad! I fear for my daughter, her mother, my family, for everyone! Our news is filled to the brim with accounts of our steady downward spiral into calamity. Should we be building bigger prisons and locking more people away, or having massive think tanks to better understand what is so wrong?
Modern society may portray unbiased, tolerant, or P.C. views for many things now, but I realize that any are still highly prejudiced to the convict. We have taken great leaps with technology, gay rights, and medical marijuana, and so why can’t we take a giant leap for the proper processing, sentencing, and rehabilitation of prisoners?

Obviously this is something a person in league with The Thing would do to reassure the victim that it is okay to get off of the furniture. He’s laughing hysterically as I make flight from the table to the loveseat which has no dust ruffle and is perched on long, slender spindles, thereby leaving no space for the tentacled Thing to hide.
He asked me if I realized how ridiculous I looked, and so I snarled, “Just ask yourself if you’re being helpful. Because you aren’t!” George turns and whistles for Gracey, our Whippet who needs one last outing for the night. She ran into the room and sniffed interestedly around the loveseat. Aha! I think there’s something there, but Gracey is obviously lulled by whatever “it” is. Hmmmmmm.
Just as I fly onto the rag rug, George and Gracey disappear out the door. I had just enough time to scramble and snick the lock into place. But what I was really thinking was crap, Windigos! George gave an inquiring glance over his shoulder, and I mouthed the word “Windigo” as I twisted the blinds shut over the glass window. He really shouldn’t have picked a movie about those ghoulies. Especially since we are vacationing in the mountains, and everyone knows it’s the Windigo’s favorite lurking spot.
I charged up the stairs, hair prickling on the backs of my arms, not because it’s cold but because The Thing has probably snuck under the open risers while my back was turned. I successfully reached the top of the stairs and flew into the bed, wriggling under the covers. Undressing, I tossed my clothes onto the chest under the window. I laid there contemplating the fact that I am the sort of girlfriend who locks a man out with the Windigo. I laid there listening to the cabin settle for the night, creaks and a breeze blowing over the shingles. There was a large thump and the click of nails on the hardwood floors. Obviously not a Windigo--they don’t have opposable thumbs to use a door key.
George thumped up the stairs then stood at the foot of the bed, removing his clothing. Sliding in, he whispered, “You’re cold.”
I whispered back, “I’m always cold when I’m scared.” I rolled toward him.
“Don’t be scared,” he said. My nose fits right under his ear. We lay there for a moment before I whispered back.
“George.”
“Yeah?”
“I’m not cold anymore.” I let the covers slip off my feet. His body moved to cover mine, and we kissed for a long time, touching everywhere."

When it becomes your life or their life, self-preservation kicks in. The adrenaline kicks in and takes over. You do what you’ve been trained to do. I was in the country for 9 months and 7 days before I was injured. I was sent to Germany for some needed surgeries before returning back stateside to Ft. Campbell to start my rehabilitation process.
I broke my left femur, my left ankle was crushed, and I had a traumatic brain injury and burns on my left arm, back, and leg. It knocked out my two front teeth. Then I was diagnosed with PTSD. I ended up getting out of the Army at my first chance. I almost died, and I’d been through some terrible things. I was ready to get far away from that life. I came home where I dealt with a whole lot of new fears! Not having a job or a steady income, fighting with the VA, and trying to get to all of my medical appointments. Finally, after 10 months of fighting with them, I got approved for disability. I am considered 90% disabled and receive $1600 a month on the streets. But during the 10 months of no job and no income, I had to do something to make some money. I made some very poor choices!! As times got harder and harder, I chose to self-medicate and began drinking heavily, smoking pot, and using other drugs. Then I started selling drugs to pay my bills and for my habit. By the time I started getting my check, it was too late. I was in too deep in the drugs, the money, and the lifestyle. I couldn’t stop, or wasn’t willing to stop.
And that’s when 5 people came to my apartment, trying to rob me. They brought a 2x4 with nails in it, and I shot the board-wielding man in the head. I continued to fire 4 more shots at the car as they left, to make sure they left. In the end, my training kicked in, and I did what I needed to do to survive. I received a 28 year prison sentence for my actions. The judge told me at sentencing that had this case not been surrounded by drugs, I wouldn’t be giving you this much time. I had to face the young man I killed, his family, and friends in court. His mother said something to me in court that I’ve never forgotten and that still sticks with me to this very day. “I don’t know how a man like you can serve his country in Iraq, come home so easily, and take the life of another human being. You deserve to never see the light of day again as a free man.” Not a day goes by that I don’t think about her words, her son, and all the pain I’ve caused. Being a trained killer is not something you can just forget how to do! When put in a kill or be killed situation, preservation kicks in! Now I fear some different things in life. As I sit in a supermax. prison for a while, which of my family members will die next? Who will be there at my release date? Will I make it to see my out date?"

It was a cold afternoon, and my first meal was supper. The bell rang, doors came open, and people filed out in jacket and boots. Behind me was an old school dude from Michigan City Prison named Ben.
We get back to the chow hall, and guys are coming from the left and right to walk single file through the chow door. A guy on my left steps up to go in, and a guy from my right rushed past me, pulls the jack of the guy in front of me, and hits him in the ribs--hard. Uhh, you hear as the attacked rushes off. The victim falls in the doorway, pulls his hand away from his rib and is leaching blood. 12 inches in front of me, a man had been stabbed, two hours after walking into the prison.
I started to help him up when Ben grabbed me from behind, “Do you know him?” As I reply no, he pushes me through the door, “Then mind your business if you want to survive.”
I walk through the line on the right, shaken and so scared I want to puke.
When I get to the window, I see the opposite from me is another window with a black dude grabbing a tray. Behind and there out, the whole line is blacks. Behind me is all white. I go to the Kool-Aid stand and wait on Ben to decide where we should sit. We find a table on the right side of the chow hall where it’s all white.
I look down at my beans and corn head and realize I can’t eat. Just the Kool-Aid makes me want to vomit. “You gonna eat that?” Ben asks. I slide it over to him.
That was the beginning of my nightmare. After all these years, I’ve learned how to sit, never with both legs under the table, in case you need to get up quickly. And always sit across from a friend. Lovers sit side by side; friends sit across from each other and watch out for each other.
I heard my first rape about a month into it. I laid in bed, clutching a piece of metal and crying with the knowledge that I couldn’t help that kid without putting myself at risk.
It didn’t matter: I was at risk anyway until I proved I was not prey. I stabbed my first man within 90 days to avoid being claimed.
Every step I took was pure fear. I was in a 48 man dorm with no police and no cameras. The police came in 6 times a day to count, locked the door, and went back downstairs. My choice was taken from me. I lived in fear, and there was no escaping it. No choice but to face it. To overcome it meant being feared. So I adapted and changed to survive.
I’ve lived this way for 20+ years, and I have scars from the top of my head to my knees. I’ve had at least 8 broken bones, and the scars people see are the least of them.
Now, I don’t fear prison. This is my world. I know how to survive. Now, as the possibility of getting out approaches, I fear the real world. I am a convict now. What will I be when I get out? What will be my identity?
I have a beautiful, loving wife. Will she see things she doesn’t like in me? Can I give her and be for her all that she deserves?
I want to be loved and truly respected, not feared. I only chose that path to survive. Can I survive out there? My question now is, can we ever be completely at ease with no fear?"

Trust in Jesus who overcame death and promised likewise for all who believe in Him (John 5:24). Since I am promised eternal life, I only need to embrace what is inevitable in order to achieve it--death… (Hebrews 2:14). Another way I will face my fear is to face the torments (1 John 4:18). I put myself through my self talk. It’s simple -- Isaiah 26:3: Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayeth on thee because he trusted in thee.
Wow! How peaceful I look forward to be. As I recall the things I had accumulated in life before prison, none of it helped me face my fears and difficulties I had no peace. How I look forward, ironically, to have peace with imprisonment and to face my fears in this hostile environment.
I look forward to facing my fears by intense commitment to Jesus and the Bible because I have experienced positive results since my 21 years of being locked up. Though I still get negative when I awake, I don’t have any positive alternative other than Jesus and the Bible. The world didn’t help me when it came time to face my lawlessness whether in or out of prison. However, Jesus has helped me and will help me, especially when I surrender to His perfect will and plan for my life. I am now ready to start facing my fears."

I’m feeling lucky today.”
“Okay, Mr. Lucky Charm. Be sure you come right back because you’re not escaping eating dinner with your mother this evening,” she said demandingly. My mother loves it when I come visit her. After kissing me on the cheek, she hugged me, “I love you.”
“I love you too!” I replied, embracing her back. I walked outside and stood on the front porch thinking how some things in life never change. I remember her saying to me, “Baby, you’ll never know when the day one of us will never come back home. And I don’t want you to ever forget how much I love you.”
Walking to the convenient store was something my mother would let me do when I was a kid. I just had to be within yelling distance--when my mother had to call my name to come in the house--before the streetlights came on. My mother lives in a low income residential area with a Section 8 housing project six blocks away. So it wasn’t a surprise to hear gunshots or to see thugs, drugs, dealers, or hoodrats walking the streets. But the part of the neighborhood my mother lived in was rich with love because the good that abodes in the people’s hearts. The people were always friendly, and they would sit on their front porch and speak or wave at almost everybody who will walk or drive by. But for some reason, something bad would happen that would break these good, well-respected, God fearing people’s hearts. I remember how I liked to go around the neighborhood doing chores to make money so I could go to the store to buy what I wanted. I was excited to bring back some Hershey Kisses and a strawberry Fanta to the girl I had a crush on. That was my young player image to the other kids on the block, but I faced a fear to actually receive a kiss from her. I called myself a hustler, but my mother didn’t approve of me using that word: “You work for your money, not hustle.” A couple of times she thought I was selling or running drugs, but I didn’t ever take that chance. My older brother had a reputation that most of the teenagers feared, and I feared what he would do to me if he caught me selling drugs. However, the people in the neighborhood loved him because he always helped the elderly in some generous way. He didn’t like accepting money for his generosity, but if it was forced on him, he will give the money to me so I could go to the store. It was our secret. It was still amazing to walk through the neighborhood seeing the kids playing and the people who had grown older in this chaotic world sit on their porch waving at me, but being faithful church goers and believers, they were at peace with their lives.
As the evening grew closer, the air became colder. I put my hood on and shoved my hands inside my hoodie’s pockets. Out of nowhere, a patrol car drove past me but suddenly stopped. The police officer ejected out of the patrol car with his gun pointing directly at me, “Freeze!” I immediately stopped but looked around to see if I was the target that the officer was aiming at. I heard a report to the dispatcher that he had the suspect at gunpoint. But what am I suspect of? A young black man in a hoodie? “You in the black and blue hoodie, slowly put your hands over your head,” he ordered demandingly. I panicked as I pulled my hands out of my pockets with my phone in my right hand. Suddenly, I fell to the ground after hearing what I thought sounded like large firecrackers. I felt this burn going through my body and my clothes were starting to get soaked with this thick liquid substance. I couldn’t move anymore, and I was in excruciating pain. I heard the screams, “Oh my god!” echoing in my head before my conscience began to talk to me. Is this what it’s like to face fear? Is this the day my mother told me about? The text from my baby’s momma. Who’s going to play video games with my son? What about my brother? Who’s going to tell my mother that I’m not coming home? Her kisses. Her hugs. Her I love yous. God forgive me. I exhaled my last breath. In reality, I woke up from this dream. Or did I?"

Of course, I had to prove myself, and since then, I’ve been able to just do time. It seems that my fears were unfounded.
Some people, though, don’t fare so well in facing their fears. Like the person afraid to fly, going on his first flight, and the plane crashes. Or the person afraid of heights goes on his roof and falls off and is paralyzed for life. Of course, these instances are one in a million, but sometimes, that one is all it takes.
Also, some fears are irrational, like the fear of dying or getting skin cancer. You become a hermit and stay inside your entire life. I know these fears are real because I’ve heard their stories, even met a couple people like that. These people live in perpetual fear, never experiencing the joys of walking through the grass or smelling roses that have freshly bloomed. For people like this, I truly feel sorry because they are missing out on so much, and they just don’t know it.
Some fears are healthy though; being afraid of some things keeps you safe. If you’re afraid of fire, you’ll never have to worry about being burnt or being afraid of heights can keep you away from tall buildings and cliffs where you could fall and be injured, or worse.
In today’s day and age, some people say that if you have fear in your heart, you’re a coward. I don’t believe that, though. No, I think the real coward is the person who’s hiding his fear instead of facing it. The guy that everybody thinks is so tough, so brave, but secretly, he’s afraid to face his biggest fear. He’s afraid of what he might find in himself. That is the true coward!"

Fear filled my mind during the whole ordeal. Before I can finish trying to explain things to my son, his face fills with disappointment as though I just crushed him.
I pick Steven up and sit him on my lap, telling him that fear isn’t always a bad thing. It saved my life: if it wasn’t the driving force of fear, I wouldn’t be here with you today. I can tell he doesn’t understand. I know I’ve got my hands full trying to explain fear to him.
Knowing this is a great opportunity to teach my son a valuable lesson, I decide to tell him the whole story because maybe it will help him in the future. I’ve learned that fear isn’t a bad thing as long as you can overcome it and face it head on. “Daddy was very scared, Steven.” I could have lost my life, and there will be times in your life when you have to face your worst fears just as I did. He looks at me and asks why those bad men shot me. I tell him that some people try to use violence to get what they want. Here’s why your daddy was shot: I was working out of town doing construction work, and it was pay day, and I’d work six 12 hour shifts that week. I was ready for some fun to unwind.
I met this pretty girl at a bar, and after a few drinks, she asked if I’d like to take a walk. We headed toward the beach to find a secluded spot to watch the sunrise bring in the new day. Only minutes after we sat down, two men came out of the dark headed straight for us at a job. I realized one had a pistol in his hand.
When they arrived, fear filled my thoughts, but I didn’t let it paralyze me. I was trying to figure a way out of this situation, and then the man raised his pistol and put it near my face. He demanded my wallet and cell phone.
I tried to keep thinking and looking for a way out, and so I handed the two items over, trying to delay the outcome I was sure was coming. The woman, whose name I don’t even know, says, “Kevin, let’s go.” Kevin starts yelling because she said his name, and now my fear level reaches new heights. But I don’t freeze. I tried to jump out of the way, but I was still shot three times.
I can tell he still doesn’t understand what I’m trying to say. I tell him that fear worked in three different ways to save my life. First, it gave me the adrenaline rush to keep going. Second, Kevin’s fear of being caught made him run off before checking to see if I was dead. Lastly, the fear of never seeing you again gave me the strength to live. I had to alternate walking and crawling to get help. The fear of losing you gave me the will to keep on, and I found to see my son again.
Never let anyone tell you that fear is a negative emotion. The only time fear is a bad thing is when you let it overcome and paralyze you. There’s nothing wrong with being afraid, and it can be a valuable tool as long as you overcome your fears and face them head on.
Fear is actually good for you. It keeps your senses sharp and helps you find the drive to overcome it. Always respect fear and use it to your advantage. It will be a great asset in dealing with the struggles you will surely encounter over your life. It will help you overcome dangerous situations. It helps you give your undivided attention to your problems.
On the other hand, never lose the emotion of fear. Once this happens, you will make costly mistakes. A lack of fear will make you careless. It will cause you not to respect and give proper attention to dangers. You’ll be more likely to encounter tragedy and get hurt without some fear.
You see, son, fear is why I’m here now. Always control and overcome your fears: never give into it. Use it to your advantage, and you’ll have the upperhand in life.
The way a child can brighten your world still amazes me. The look of Steven on that day will be in my mind as long as I live. When he told me he was proud of his brave daddy, he melted my heart. To top the matter off, he told me he would never let fear overcome him and that he would tackle his troubles head on.
All in all, remember fear isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The difference between a coward and a brave man is being able to overcome your fears. My greatest fear was never seeing my son again, and that gave me the energy and fight to survive."

Monday morning, a complaint was mailed to Chaplain of Brazoria County Detention center. The entire incident was related just as you read it in Prisoner Express. These two Churchy People are banned from county jail.
Facinus Quos Inquinat Aequat. Villany makes all those whom it contaminates equal in character. The Bible calls me--and you too--a lost sheep for whom Christ died, and for whom Christ will intercede before my final judgement. Then who was that Churchy GUy? Was he speaking as the Dragon would speak, or as the Lamb?
What about you? Did you pick up that Bible when you came to TDCJ with me? Fine business. But whatever you’re going to be, just be that. Preach to me by what you do. That’ll carry more weight than anything you can say. God can hear you just fine, even if you rarely say a word."

I discovered something about myself: I am not stupid. Some courses are harder for me than others (thank God my math requirements are over), and some courses require more hours of study than others, but that is expected. I am currently in my third semester of college, and this semester, I am taking 9 semester hours. It is a lot of hard work and requires me to put aside other things that I like to do, but to me, it is well worth it.
I wish I had the courage to face all of my fears while I was still a free man, but that is not the way it unfolded in my life. I will never be able to get back those years that I listened to other people and allowed them to dictate what I did.

Prison administrators (prisoncrats) typically conspire to inflict as much misery and degradation on prisoners as they can get away with, typically resulting in a prisoner’s mind being destroyed or their personality growing ugly.3,4,5
Evil in, evil out.
For the many out there who believe otherwise--it must be many, because this is a democracy and voters haven’t dethroned the prison cats causing prisons’ systemic degradation--please explain why we so often hear of soldiers returning from the acute NEF or war with dangerous mental problems but have never heard of a soldier returning from war with improved mental health? This belief that you can torment people and they they are still to blame for any negative reaction to that torment is based on the delusion that people have a miraculously, entirely free will.6 This belief often results in people who’ve been tormented from birth--such is the case for many prisoners--and responded negatively to that torment.7 Then they are further tormented by the prison system for that negative response, ad infinitum.
For society to knowingly permit the persistence of this sadistic cycle of degradation, society must be scared of something or hate something--same thing. What society fears or hates must have something to do with what might occur if society ran humane prisons in which those wanting to be restored to society have that opportunity--and even those who persist in their criminal ways are restricted from doing so. Or a prison where no one is incarcerated as punishment or held in punitive conditions.
A treaty ratified by the U.S. requires as much: “All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person” (Article 10 of the U.N.’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). The U.S. is a leading member of the U.N., yet awesomely ignores Rule 57 of the U.N.’s Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners: “Imprisonment and other measures which result in cutting off an offender from the outside world are afflictive… Therefore the prison system shall not...aggravate the suffering inherent in such a situation.”
There are many theories as to what some of the fears are that motivate people to at least ignore the nature of the prisons their elected government has created. Whether or not those theories are correct, nothing will change until people let go of their fears.

A responsiveness gene is a gene that “responds” to environmental factors, unlike for example, the genes that determine our eye color. The gene changes its resulting “product.”
A prison psychologist told me this, but it’s also revealed in texts like The Mask of Sanity and The Psychopath Inside.
As revealed in Parental Incarceration (Routledge 2016), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), what I’ve called NEFs, harm a child’s development. Most prisoners have experienced numerous ACEs. However, developmental resources and support (e.g. a grandmother’s love) can cancel out the impact of ACEs.
The most frequent excuse prison staff give for punishing prisoners is that it’s needed for security reason.
In describing the effects of solitary confinement, it’s known that, “A considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a short confinement, into a semi-fatuous condition from which it was next to impossible to arouse them, and others became violently insane.”
See “Do We Really Have a Choice?” posted on my blog Prometheus Writes! in October 2011. The article explains how free our will is and isn’t. betweenthebars.org/blogs/540
See Parental Incarceration.
With all the documentaries, news reports, books, and web articles exposing the nature of U.S. prisons, society cannot plead ignorant.

She raises a shaking hand and points at the defendant seated off to the left. The same defendant that has glared at her and stalked her every word with his bitter eyes. The same defendant that has been sending her terrifying letters and threatening her life. The same defendant that will eventually plead guilty in favor of a reduced sentence. The very same defendant that will beg for the court’s mercy for his admitted “mistake.” The woman’s face is still slightly drooping to the right with her lips slightly twisted because of nerve damage from a surgery she had to undergo after the assault. Her eyes spark brightly, and in this moment, she knows that she can face fear. She can point hear out. She can identify fear and give him his proper name.
“Yes, sir. I see the man who raped and beat me in this courtroom. He’s right there.” With a sigh of relief, I lower my hand, realizing that although I just faced fear, I must now begin the journey of facing the demon that still keeps me reliving that day over and over again."

(I’m stupid stubborn.) She said she wouldn’t put in any objections on one condition: I had to wait until the next day and to write one last entry in my journal about what I was feeling and why Ray’s leaving bothered me so much. I reluctantly agreed, thinking 24 hours wouldn’t make a difference--or would writing in that stupid journal.
When I sat down that night to write about the day’s events, nothing could come to me except mundane, superficial bullshit. So I tried, for my first time, the technique of free-writing. I sat back, closed my eyes, and took several deep breaths as I focused on my emotional state and thoughts. After a while, I sat back up and started writing whatever came to me. The first couple of sentences was gibberish, but I got no more than another paragraph when I realized how effective free-writing was. I felt so foolish about how I acted, and I was hit with the realization that what I was doing was trying to hide from myself that I was afraid that if Ray got kicked out, that I would, not could but would, be kicked out as well. I would be abandoned again. Boy, was this a hard thing to accept, but as I wrote, my psych opened up to reveal one of my greatest fears: being abandoned.
The next day, I met with my therapist and apologized for my behavior, thanked her for forcing me to wait and for suffering my tantrum, and decided to stay in the program. When she read my journal entry, she was pleased and let me know how well I’d done. Then she told me that Ray hadn’t been kicked out of the program; he requested to be removed because he wasn’t going to comply with some of the program requirements.
That was a mean trick she played! Haha, not really. The lesson I learned is to always face my fears and figure out what the core issues are and deal with them instead of hiding from them. By hiding from my fears, I hide from living life and learn nothing. Eventually, I would destroy who I am and who I can become. When this happens, it takes years to either rebuild what’s been destroyed, if that’s even possible, or build a better me. I never forget it is possible to accomplish building a better me and never give up on myself. I slide back sometimes, but I never quit."

The person that had let me down more than anyone, although I continued to place the blame elsewhere. The person I could no longer recognize when I looked in the mirror, seeing only the image that my fears had produced: a grotesque mask, filled with as much self-loathing as it was unbridled hostility toward a world in which I never felt like I quite belonged.
It wasn’t until after I had spent more of my life in the confines of a cage than I had as a free man living and walking in society, that I began to face those demons within me which were the accumulation of my fears. I began to peel back all those layers that had been used to cover up my vulnerability and insecurities. Slowly and gradually, my true self/spirit began to emerge.
Today, there is the occasional worry or apprehension about one thing or the other. The difference now is that I know how to face them and get to the root of the issues before they can become anything more than a passing anxiety. I stop letting my fears become greater than the circumstances which cause them. Now I am able to face life’s challenges with the confidence and certainty of knowing I am equipped with a very strong determination and resolve.
Facing and overcoming my fears have been the most liberating of feelings. They enabled me to channel my thoughts and emotions in ways and to places that have help me expand as a human being. I have been able to use past experience to glean wisdom from life lessons while I use new experiences as an opportunity to gain fresh perspectives. I am so humbled by what I have made it through and how far I’ve come. And I know none of it would have been possible if I didn’t have the courage to step beyond the boundaries of my fears."

Unlike the previous categories, these monikers are given to strangers in foreign areas, along with a conscious effort by the perpetrators to conceal his real identity. Additionally, unlike the other categories that could apply to anybody, these types of nicknames are reserved for the criminal element and those looking to evade accountability. For example, a guy that moves to Seattle with the intent to sell drugs would not give his “real” nickname but rather create a second nickname. Or a person running from the law, or the homies, would also be inclined to give a fake moniker.

Perhaps because I’m in prison, it’s refreshing to meet someone without a nickname. As opposed to “Big Liquor Sto,” plain ol’ “Josh” has an unpretentious feel to it. To me, nicknames are facades that people hide behind. The question becomes what makes a person feel the need to want to hide behind such facades. COuld it be shame? A sense of insecurity?
Such feelings of inadequacies--believe it or not--are actually fostered within our society. Radio and television constantly bombard us with the notion that we’re not complete in our natural state. In other words, females need makeup, guys need to shave and workout, the dog needs a collar, Susan needs the new cell phone, and Dad needs a sports car--all to feel complete. (Some cultures find the natural human scent erotic, something we find gag-inducing here.) Perhaps nicknames are the psychological manifestation of the seeds of inadequacies planted by the media and society To those that merely call it improvement, I say that they presuppose that there are inadequacies that require improvement.
So what am I saying? That you are perfect as you are, so do nothing to improve? No, of course not. I’m just saying that you’re alright, even without a nickname."

“What?” He asked.
So I told him, “Yeah, she hollered out ‘youngsta’, that’s my name!”
Before I could continue on with my rant, him and his homeboy busted out laughing. In between their laughter I got a few words in, “Shit, go and ask the rest of the smokers, they call me youngsta too!” Calming down, he told me, “Say lil’ homie, they call anyone younger than they are youngsta, and especially if they got dope.” Dumbstruck, I glanced over at the dope fiends and thought about going over there to help make my point, until one came over to us and asked a boy that was talking to me for some dope.
“Say youngsta, let me get a wake up. I got you when this trick pull up.”

Wisconsin would pull me back, and so while in the feds, I intended to get all I could, including head tattoos.
When a Latino prisoner ineffectively attacked a guard in the chow hall, twenty feet from me, we were all locked in our cells for a week. During that lockdown, I had my toothless, meth-head cellie go nuts on my head with his tattoo gun. On the back of my head, I had him put a Celtic knot inspired horned owl to scare off anyone who might try to attack me from behind. On the side of my head, I had him put “144,” my full-scale I.Q. score, and from the ends of my eyebrow to the crown of my head, he put solid black horns.
The horns had multiple meanings. The next time someone called me a white devil, I’d say, “Duh!” I was an Atheist, not a Satanist, and the horns should discourage theists from bringing their mind poison to me. Horns also, to me, symbolized rejection of authority, as Satan did God in the Christian myth. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was like Satan in that he enlightened humanity against Zeus’ will. I saw myself as a Promethean as I enlighten humanity through my blog, Prometheus Writes! Last and most importantly, I wanted female staff to ask me, “What do those horns mean?”
“I’m horny,” I’d answer, and see where it went from there. Every female staff member who’s seen them has been amused, especially the many who’ve asked what they mean. Male staff almost always frown on them--little-horn complexes, no doubt.
I was also going to get a snorkel tattooed on my face with the words “Muff Diver” along the tube--boy, would that have driven Wisconsin guards up the fence! But a buddy I made, Tommy “The Butcher” Pitera, urged me not to get any more head or face tattoos. I was teaching him how to draw, and he wanted to plug me with wealthy but conservative art buyers who might be turned off by such tattoos.
Nicknames are common in prison and often based on a prominent feature. With my large, blatant horns, I inevitably was called “Horns.” Now that I’m back in Wisconsin’s prison system, the nickname has followed me. Keep it horny!"

If we had to be openly called the very best parts of who we are maybe we would be kinder. Honest. Respectful. Giving. Helpful. Forgiving. Loving. And oh wouldn’t it be something if we could mean it every time we call out, “Hey FRIEND!”
Nicknames. From childhood until our adulthood and even sometimes on our graves when we are gone, we wear them, own them, love them...sometimes we can’t stand them!

Even on family camping trips to the lake, and I always had my Walkman. So did most kids I knew. Childhood obesity wasn’t really an issue then because we were always outside and active. We were without fear. Yeah we had video games, VHS and all, but those things were just part of our lives, not all of it. We were not slaves to cellphones (because they didn’t exist or were really expensive), laptops, tablets, apps etc. Instead we interacted like humans are supposed to: face-to-face.
I became a teenager and went through puberty during the grunge movement. Bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice In Chains changed the music world, particularly mine and their lyrics spoke to my angsty teenage soul. Those were songs my friends and I would headbang to, get high and escape to, or simply listen to while aimlessly driving around once we got our licenses.
The memories of those days seem endless; one long soundtrack in my mind. A song can instantly take me back. Back to when the future was bring and the possibilities limitless. Before everyone seemed so angry and afraid; before friends died young; before I screwed my life up; before the future seemed so dim. “Where is the life I recognize? Gone Away.”
I look around these days and feel like a stranger on this planet, sixteen years in prison will do that some. Still, life really is set to a soundtrack and old lyrics gain different meanings over time. Especially these:
“But I won’t cry for yesterday,
There’s an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way,
To the ordinary world,

It was the zealot mindset that planted the seeds that sparked the birth of the monster, one born with so many defects. It has spiraled out of control since the religious people are mad. This had brought me to believe that I am going to be executed because of religious persecution. Do you remember that in Social Studies class? I’ll give you another hint. It’s why our ancestors came over here to discover all reds, in the olden days.
The state of Texas passed a law outlawing pornography within the prison system. Lawmakers got us cable that was strictly basic, then religious people mandated that we should only have certain channels. We get: ESPN1, ESPN2, TBS, USA, TNT. We get five channels that are Christian, one spanish channel, and syndicated networks like:NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox. In other words, what televisions come with. They did all this within prison walls. Can you guess how that happened? Another hint. Whenever a person helps out for free.
On every unit in the entire Texas Department of Criminal Justice, they have faith based ways. At least one in which you must be trying to better yourself, but they want the betterment to come strictly by way of religion, their religion. You kind of have the choice, but you’re not allowed to choose: paganism, wicca, Adversary, etc. These are all established religious practices. Go to TDCJ.com.
Christianity is the religion that rules the roost. The program is based on, and in the realm of, that particular standard. Volunteers control the inmates that follow their own particular guidelines of that faith. Then, those inmates, that follow their own particular guidelines of that faith, control other incarcerated citizens in turn. All using the tell-on-them system. Seriously? Everything on that wing is highly regulated by inmates. Will you believe that?
The television must be off for meetings. You can’t order certain magazines. Many TV shows:sitcoms, movies, soap operas, and even talk shows, may never be viewed. People in other wings can have all those things. If a prisoner moves into that wing, they lose all of those privileges except for magazines and books.
Perhaps prison guards only do things out of necessity. More than any other life on the planet combined. Hundreds of millions of dollars. Most of which was paid for by Christian Church Congregations. We’re made from this. A lot of that was under the table payments. Bribes came forth from the little tax-free, give me, fundraiser box. An entire black market has been created along with a streamlined snitch system. Some guards bring in cigarettes and porn for billfold money. When an inmate tells on them, they get a promotion
So everybody wins right? No! Because it’s racial profiling at its best. You see, Christians are majority speckled gray. Catholics are hispanic. Blacks are muslim, and Asian people are Taoist. There are Native Americans and Jewish faiths, but they have it hardest of all. The prison officials they are looking to bust come from the cities.
Ideas are but forms of data, and information is the only thing that can keep the government in charge in working, not necessarily viable, economy. So the snitch program was instituted by the religious dorms. It is a new age slavery. The system is racist. If a white christian pleads insanity, they are unfit to stand trial. The only reason you can’t persecute christians is because they can’t tell each other apart.
Perhaps, the good old days have come and gone. Maybe I’ll be murdered for not being a particular prayer group’s cup of tea. I have been locked up for fifteen years. I’ve seen a lot of religious discrimination. I’ve seen even more racism.I haven’t seen much sexism. Texas is sexist though. When a certain woman becomes president, Ephraim and Menashe shall part."

This was my squadron. A unit of pilots that were, yes, colored, but also would be the very best. We were not the first with the famous Red Tails, but I was determined we would not be the last. It was my job to ensure their success.
I was not concerned, in the least with the color of their skin; unlike much of the world at that time. All I cared about was their ability. Nor did I care where they’d come from. Only what they could do. I had hand picked each one of these men for their accomplishments. Each and every one had the reflexes of a cat, and each had in one way or another, displayed leadership qualities.These were the things I looked for in them. The only things I saw when looking out at them now.
And so, there they sit. Quietly watching me. Patiently waiting to hear what it is I have to say to them. As I look into each of their young faces I swell with pride. This is my squadron. So, to them I say: “Gentlemen, let’s begin.”"

You did time with people who say they got framed on a possession charge.” She tossed a baggie into my lap. “Eight ball. Do you play ball or do you risk a possession charge?”
Now that’s a tough decision!
We crossed West Crosstimbers before Princess realized how much she’d bitten off. She turned to the back seat. My teddy bear sat placidly looking forward. Princess gave me a stern stare.
“I researched you. I went to Cornell University website. They have a program called Prisoner Express. I read all your essays in Prisoner Express. All of them. I especially liked ‘The Two-Five-Five Project’, about radio remote control.”
We rose to top the railroad overpass. The jeep slowed in preparation for the turn. “It’s true.” At the overpass bottom we made the right onto Thirty-Fourth. “In 1975 we built a robot in high school. We used Citizen’s Band radio to control it.”
We rounded the corner onto Pecan, then parked at 104 North Pecan, the end house4. Princess gave my stuffed animal a baleful glare. “It is bugged?”
The baggie she’d thrown into my lap for entrapment was held in the air between our seats. Shotgun saw it. “You didn’t ask that before you planted this on me. Dummy! Come inside. We’ll talk everything over.”
Princess opened her door. “Any more booby traps?”
My door was opened. “Yes! Don’t be a booby any more. Make note of my license plates.”
Detective Gold followed me into The Shack, carrying her sack. “KD5CHN? I knew you’re a ham.” We walked back to the kitchen. My sack flopped on the table. Princess took a plate from the cabinet. “Look, is there some way we could work this out?”
My curt nod acknowledged her. Detective Gold must initiate the transaction herself. Once she broke ice, though, she wasn’t clothed with the authority of the State of Texas. The matter became a routine business deal. Whatever a willing seller would accept and whatever a willing buyer would give constituted a fair price. “Yes. We can work out your entrapment.”
Princess arranged doughnuts on the plate. She started the microwave. “Hot doughnuts. Hot coffee.” Then she sighed. “What will it take?”
“You researched me? You know what I’m all about. We’ll eat our doughnuts. We’ll go in my bedroom.”
“I can’t cheat on my husband!”
“Adultery or prosecution. Your choice.”
The microwave dinged. Yeah, when you draw heat in prison then you gotta fade your own heat."

I’ve done so much of it all I do is day for day; but lately I've been looking at the future, seeing myself free! Not just hoping for freedom but seeing my freedom just a few days away. Day and month are not the same to me as to most. I do day to day weather a week passes or months there all the same. Only now I’m getting the understanding of time. Not just day in day out. There’s more to it, it’s the future that’s getting close I believe. You mention how our words can reach beyond these walls. :) Believe me I understand that I’ve had pen pals throughout the years and that is how it feels. As if our words are beyond these walls. It helps my thinking as well. I can let my aggression off on paper, and not on any one around me. Its taken a long time to keep that kind of emotion in check. And not just let it build inside off and don’t write while you’re mad. Well you can just don’t send it out on the first draft. Set it to the side and then go through your emotions after the final draft! Haha lol. I learned this the hard way you can hurt worse with these words then with a knife!

The minimum-security prisoners could earn furloughs, with approved sponsors, of up to thirty-six hours on the weekends and holidays. Now, the general population is allowed a maximum of only twenty-four hours a month, in two-hour blocks, for visiting. Only family members, one single female (or male for the women), children have to be specially approved, and all visitors have to be background checked and on your approved visitor list. If anyone wanting to visit you is on another prisoner’s list (even a husband, wife, mother, father, sister, brother, children, etc.), they can’t unless they get removed from the other prisoner’s list and put on yours, and vice versa. These same rules apply for minimum-security prisoners - no extra time, no furloughs, no conjugals - nothing.
Then, the Criminal Justice goals were to separate the convicted from society, offer educational, programming, and religious services; jobs were mandatory; a pretty much determined amount of time to do (although Utah has always had indeterminate sentencing) with a transitional program back into mainstream society. Now, even though we are offered all of the above in principle, jobs are scarce (only about fifteen percent of prisoners have jobs out of the sections), the programming and education superficial, religious services are actually better, only a few prisoners go through structured transition programs, and the Board of [no] Pardons is giving as much time as they can get away with.
Then, there was only about five percent of the prisoners considered maximum-security status, the only prisoners in county jails were in protective custody (about five percent), and the rest of the prisoners were considered medium-security status (about sixty percent). All housed at one central facility except the protective custody prisoners. The total population was only about two thousand, two hundred prisoners (1987). Now, between fifteen and twenty percent of prisoners are in maximum-security housing, less than ten percent are in minimum-security housing, thirty-five to forty percent are housed in county jails (which is tantamount to being housed in Maximum), the rest are divided between two facilities (about thirty to forty percent) of medium-security. The prison population is now between seven thousand and seven thousand, five hundred prisoners (could be more). An increase of about three hundred forty percent.
Throughout history correctional ideologies have been in a constant flux. With harcore punishment on one end and rehabilitation philosophies on the other. Over the past thirty-plus years American correctional practices has went so far to the hardcore end, the Scales-of-[un]Justice have broken - throwing off into obscurity the people that are supposed to be helped by the system (this includes the victims). Mass-punishment; solitary confinement; psychological torture; outlandishly long sentences; inadequate programming, education, mental and medical health care services, housing, diet, job training, re-entry services, parole officers, etc...The privatization of prisons has created a system with a revolving door of mass populations - the more prisoners, the more money.
Although, recently there have been tremors felt in the scales of justice. Almost like it is having a service evaluation of damage: seeing what, if anything, can be done to fix it. The tremors are slight and sporadic, but they are felt. Hopefully society can get to work and fix the Scales of Justice for good.
Unfortunately, I believe there isn’t the desire or the skill needed to accomplish this task."

As I watch him the immediate question of, how can I leave him, my dog, enters my head. Anxious flutters arouse.
Nobody can understand their disabilities such as I do. Ya sure, my sister will continue to care for him, and love him, but she’ll never understand his hidden pain. Mere moments until an inevitable lonely death take hold of me, and out of nowhere, this stud of a dog, because he is the definition of the term “horndog” and all one foot of him, loves all things female, won’t stop licking my hand, demanding my attention.
“What the cuk do you want?” I yell at mocho at three in the morning.
His desperate eyes simply say it all. “You”
An instant change in my entire demeanor was felt throughout my entire skinny shaky body. Tired tears flowed down my face as flashes of my forgotten family made their way into my selfish mind. Then, with only minutes to spare, life was pumped back into my lungs, while I reached for the comfort of my dogs weeping, uncontrollably into the comfort of their fur. They understood.
Okay, yes this story sounds a bit fishy, and the one other person in the world that listened to me tell it pretty much thought the same thing. That night thirteen years ago on my sister’s couch/ my bedroom, loaded out of my mind, with a note in hand, and a belt death-gripped around my neck, I chose, subconsciously maybe, to see what I needed to see. No, I didn’t see him talk to me, an animation episode, he just felt my pain, and somehow let me know that. A two-legged dog helped rescue me from almost certain death, and now I owe it to him to show the world his love. Mocho standing tall that night on his two back legs, opened my eyes up, enough to see a bit more truth that resides within our lives. We are who we are, inside and out. With all of our faults that plague our survival, open for the world to view, and for us to deal with. Be responsible for yourself while offering a hand to someone else in need, even if the hand is a furry stub. Every bit matters in those dark moments, believe me."

My prayers were finally being answered. I was just waiting for her to reel it in, but, unfortunately, it didn’t go that way. She started having trouble so I put my arm around her to make sure she wouldn’t go overboard. She yelled at me to let go, so I did. After a quick jerk of the rod, a catfish sailed out of the water, whiskers in sight. He stared at us as he dove right back into the water. Goldie, exhausted, hollered, “boy, get this pole!”. My cousin pushed me out of the way and came for the pole. Later we found out she was talking to me. The whole boat rocked as he ran from one end of the boat to the other, and we flipped. Before I hit the water, all I could think was “thank God I didn’t wear my Jordan’s” I was an experienced swimmer, and I held my breath before I hit the water. I made sure Goldie was safe, and holding onto the side of the boat. My cousin was my second priority. He was scared. He calmed down, and let me know he couldn’t swim. I looked into Goldie’s terrified eyes, and she told me she couldn’t swim either.
I looked to the shore, intimidated by the distance, but knew what I had to do. I told Goldie I was going to take her back to the shore. I floated on my back to conserve energy. I told her to grab my waist. I kicked my feet to gain speed, and used my arms to steer.I struggled to keep a consistent flow. I was fit, but this seemed to be an almost impossible task. I kept pushing, for the sake of Goldie. We hit a natural habitat, and I was able to catch my breath. I don’t remember exactly how long the distance to the shore was, but if I had to guess, I would say a quarter mile. Goldie saw my cousin struggling, and reminded me to help him out. I swam back to the boat, and could see the shock on his face. He panicked and dunked my head under the water. I emerged from the water, and told him to stop and be cool. He kept panicking and pulling me under. I was frustrated, and after three jabs and a bloody nose, he calmed down. I felt like he was trying to drown us. After some time, I got us all back to sure, where my cousin gave me a piece of his mind. Goldie was happy that we lost the fish rather than our lives. The next time I was hungry, she told me I could have whatever I want."

When in actuality nothing could have been further from the truth. I was gainfully employed and had a decent place to live. However, my life was very much rescued by coming to prison.
While I was still out in what is commonly called the “free world” by those of us who are incarcerated, I was a functioning alcoholic and drug addict. The sole reason that I had and kept a job was so I would have money to purchase alcohol and drugs. The fact that I was able to function in society was simply because I had not yet reached the low point in my addiction. That point where every waking moment is spent in pursuit of the next drink, the next line of cocaine or the next shot of methamphetamine.
I am totally convinced that if I had not been arrested and come to prison when I did, I would have died in my addiction. I was headed to an early grave only to receive a reprieve from this certain death sentence by of all things, prison.
Comprehension does not come immediately to those of us who have been heavily involved with drugs. I was not immediately aware that being confined inside a prison was what would eventually become my liberation. I no longer have the urge or desire to drink or do drugs. I now realize that exactly how much those years of drug abuse has ended up costing me.
That absence of family and friends that I mentioned earlier in this article is just part of the high price of living high. I know that I was not the best brother or friend that I could have been while I was out there. All of the lies and all of the denials have taken their toll even on those who loved me the most. More than twenty years inside, and they are still waiting for the slip that they are sure will come. It seems realization also comes slowly to those who have heard it, and seen it all, too many times before.
I have since been rescued once again during my incarceration here in prison. On November 12, 2012, I fell to my knees inside my one man cell and cried out to God. I told God that I was not sure if He remembered me or not, there were many times that I was convinced He had completely turned his back on me, but was there any way that He could find it within Himself to forgive me for all the things that I had done in my life that was contrary to his holy standard? I told him that I know Jesus is the Son of God, and that he Died on the cross to pay the penalty for my sin. I told him that I had attempted to run my life 45 years, and the only thing I had been able to accomplish in that time was to get a life sentence and 262 months in federal prison on top of that. I gave him control of my life and asked Jesus Christ to come into my life to be my Savior. I discovered that it wasn’t God who had turned His back on me; but it was I who had shunned him.
Yes, my dining companion that day was absolutely correct. Prison has indeed rescued me, and in so many more ways than he could have ever known on that day in the chow hall.

They have passed four new laws that let dopies and thieves recycle in and out of our Oklahoma slow-death camps faster and faster. The “Re-Elect Me!” geniuses call this their new “Git Smart On Crime!” initiative. By giving these dopies and thieves yet another cool break, our Oklahoma (OK) politicians encourage these little darlings to rush out and get addicted to even more wonderful drugs to kill and die for. The survivors will perpetrate more, worse crimes, than get recycled back to prison with endless sentences. So, “Smart on Crime” looks a lot like (The exact same as) “Tough on Crime”, except with a smidgen of “Thin the Herd” added.
OK politicians prove that they know what they are really doing by buying another slow-death camp. CCA had to abandon it when, after a twenty year fight, California finally was forced to un-ass fifty thousand of their cursed slaves. That’s pure gold for OK “pols”, whose legal slave industry still turns a humongous taxpayer-paid profit. They are filling it up now. California prisoners, much smarter than Oklahoma inmates, sued their way out. OK inmates sit on their hands while OK prisoncrats shut down fifteen pre-release work centers!
OK politicians are smart on crime like a fox to throw their inmates out with no cash, no skills, and no better education than what they were thrown in with. These lucky dopies and thieves will recycle in no time!
One problem is that OK captives are getting too old to work and cost too much in medical bills. OK politicians have a cunning plan for ditching these geriatric captives too! It’s in inadequate health care! These old buzzards are eaten up with heart disease, lung disease and cirrhosis from smoking and alcoholism, so help them die faster by taking away their aspirin and making their only choice that liver-killing toxin Tylenol.
The first part of their plan worked beautifully: all the old inmates sport pus-guts so big that they need wheelbarrows to carry them. Decades of no exercise in tiny cages, and eating mad-cow scrap “meat” and nitrate-poisoned baloneys have given them all diabetes and cancers that they don’t even know they have. They get rich selling the inmates “Tums” and watch them die. Soon the whole herd of slaves will be young, stupid twerps again, eager to work all day for nothing! Yes, we in these slow-death state prison camps are indeed rescued!"

So I did. A few months later, I had steady work and rented a small but nice house for us. Now it was time for her to join me, and she did; it was a dream come true.
For months it went well, but all dreams do not last. I’m not exactly sure what it was that triggered the change. Perhaps it was just something wrong with me. Some wiring in my brain that got crossed. Or maybe a disagreement between us. Maybe I just wasn’t happy with our financial situation. I can’t be certain. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to pinpoint the exact moment I began to slip. Though now, I look back on it, it seemed inevitable. One minute I think I’m floating safe and free in a near perfect vacuum, and slowly but surely, I feel the pull of gravity from a distant black hole. Quicker and quicker I fell towards my destruction.
Gradually things became too stressful between her and me. There was a break. She left our little dream house and left me to my own devices. That has never been a good thing for me.
The pull of gravity felt stronger and acceleration increased.
Eventually, and it didn’t take long, my mind became so discontent that I decided to leave my promised land. I returned home to old friends and old ways.
I would tell myself I had done it to protect her. Out of love for her, and to some degree that is true I suppose. For a time after she had moved out and before I’d left, we attempted to resolve our issues. They never really were our issues. They were mine alone. I saw no sense in dragging her down with me.
The torment and chaos of it all drove me mad and of course, being around old friends, and being back to my old ways, it wasn’t hard to fall into old habits. I spiraled further down into the vortex.I stopped caring, and that’s when things are at their worst. It became clear to me that there was only one conclusion.
However, I was wrong. There is always more than one way for things to end. Fortunately, the decision was taken away from me. I will never truly know which way things could have gone, and that’s the funny thing about all the could’ve beens in life. That’s the simple fact of life. There’s no way to truly know. It didn’t go down a certain way, and nothing can change that.
Yes, I committed a crime. I’m serving an extensive prison sentence for it. Quite possibly for the rest of my natural life, but in coming to prison I was rescued. Saved from self annihilation. I was given another chance at life.
Now, you may wonder what kind of life is it? How can one truly live from behind prison walls? My answer is simple. The only other option was to not live at all. Although I may sit in a concrete cell, my mind is free. At least I still have a life to live."

In theory, I knew the technique and the ratio of compressions to ventilations, but I had never actually pushed on a human’s chest wall to artificially pump blood through his body. I began tentatively at first, worried somehow that I would hurt him. That was until I was instructed to push harder, deeper by the paramedic. Get the blood pumping through his body and do the work of the heart for it, he told me. And that was what I needed to hear. I gave it everything I had. I let loose of my fears of death and did what I was trained to do. I gave it my all.
When we got to the hospital, an ER staff member relieved me. I staggered away red faced, breathing heavily and drenched in sweat. I knew I had done my very best to give that man a chance.
Despite the efforts of firefighters, paramedics, and ER staff, the man was pronounced dead only minutes after arriving at the hospital. I went outside and sat with my back against the brick wall of the ER and contemplated what I had just been through. I shed some tears and asked if I could really do this. The answer came a few minutes later when the paramedic came outside to join me. He said that although doing the job was emotionally and physically draining he couldn’t see himself doing anything else. We lose some, we save some, but those we can rescue far outweigh any sacrifice we have to make."

Because they clean our Earth for us. Taking within themselves every bad-negative thing. Then it becomes a CANCER when it metamorphosizes into their meat. But the truth in the fact only comes when it dies. For that wastefulness does not return. No, never again does it contaminate. That, due to the fact of what comes to get it.
Please be kind enough to at least consider. Our swamps clean our fresh water, but when you come to see a swamp looking healthy, that means it is dying. Ours is dying because of overfishing.
A swamp is supposed to look like the gloom, smell like the unbathed, taste like terrible, and cause you to feel like the greatest of depression. But, today's do none of these. Because we are stealing all of the crawdads. Now, the moss is dying.
My granny and poppa says to me when I was still itty-bitty, “The Bible was never supposed to be changed, but they did it anyway.” I didn’t know it then, but it’s due to the fact that there was not any light left in them.
The cure must always come before the disease. So please be so very kind as to at least try me. As silver is the hardest to refine. Do not take any unclean animal out of its habitat. Leave it be. Just because it is already out does not mean you should go ahead and purchase it either. Nor eat it within another’s home or place of business either. Check also, all usable products, to see if anything unclean is within it. That you will not use that at all. But be mindful that tricky laws are in place so they may still be labeled as kosher in varying ways.
Now, take this just as seriously--for the sake of your children. Please, keep yourselves cold at all costs. A mosquito hates the cold because of what it does to the blood. Don’t put pesticides in your yard, never ever again. They kill the bugs that eat the mosquitoes. Have a male start your cars. Be sure to have him stay in it until it gets cold. But never open the sunroof, nor let the top down. Especially, if the windows are down, due to the fact that the air conditioning doesn’t work. Don’t use an outside vent in place of cold air, never.
Also be sure to fully submerge yourself in ice water once a week (your entire body because it shocks your system by training it to look out for danger); do not ever put any bug repellant on yourselves (it contains sugars that attract mosquitoes to you as well as a chemical component that keeps a few of the others from working together); put bug zappers on the sides- one about three steps from the front on the right the other one three steps from the back on the left of your home, put brass windchimes on a hanger at your front and back door because they call to the good insects, and spread sulfur in your yard once or twice a week.
Please be so kind as to keep listening. That you will not send anyone else to Brazil. For the Olympics, I mean. Because that’s where the hive is. Even though it is not the source. You would have to go to Asia for that, by way of Nepal. Yakuza, just as Triads are putting dangerous chemicals into the plants to cause them to burn poison emissions. Or, Crimean Mafias are sending Nuclear waste into certain parts of our sea. Because they know our groundwater comes from the ocean pushing itself through the Earth.
Our fracking is destroying us as well. Because we refill all the gaps with mud and this and that. But that water must pass-in every bit of humility and sincerity I say this- through those gases to carry on the natural selection cleaning process of our groundwater. As all elements live harmoniously within one another once you reach a certain depth. Just as if you go down to a certain level within the ocean you will implode, but if you keep on you will explode. (A specific type of weight with a sensor within will teach you this, if only you add a few cracks)
The currents in water change at various depths because it's our true source of gravity. It literally makes us spin. And just as the waters above teach us- PLANKTON- the source of eternal life- is far too important to let slip away by way of any contaminations whatsoever.like allowing any country-like the entire continent of South America to use DDT pesticide- destruction rights. We need plankton more than all life. Including ourselves.
Eff is the only pesticide you need for the vine. Just as you truly should allow ivy to grow around your fence line because it attracts both bees and ants.(the farmer’s guardian and secret protector.) Please know though, if you place an egg by a tree, you must do so on three- I will leave it to you to figure out- sides onl. And, a bush, none.
They’re not here to trickle down aid on us anymore you know. All of the governments of this, our world. There is no exception to what I say. We know this is the truth based on the fact that each race’s leaders are promoting racism now more than ever. As divine intervention only comes by way of those who do not: look, think, act, or even profess faith as you do. Can you believe this even though you know for certain I have always been poor?
Moses (Moshe) is a mitzrite name. In mitzrayim, all the firstborn of the Hebrew livestock- and mixed multitude which included white slaves-did not die.Pharoah’s daughter to the sister of Moses, named Misiam, she would pay wages to her mother for caring for him. Now please, read from now on for a reason of. Not: reasoning, purpose, way-of-life. For that is what we ourselves must give scripture.
Slaves do not get paid. Mixed peoples were created to be servants. Even still, they have the time. So he allowed them animals as well. For: milk, cheese, and butter. They were not though, allowed to eat meat, not eat animals in any shape, form or fashion. Controlling this law keeping butchering connected to the temples. So the lamb’s blood couldn’t have been the protector. Ask my cousin Ivy because I don’t comprehend black egyptian folklore. But I do know that no person’s race as a whole has never worked up a sweat unpaid. Not since the silver win was invented.
You must look within, or the pestilence will remain. The: white lies to white, black to black, red to red, yellow to yellow. Redeem your firstborn by having them save the speckled gray. As your women save all swamplands. And children, unclean. Oh yeah, they don’t yet know how to clean Nuclear waste from seas nor Lyme from air."

The chaplain was standing on her tiptoes, trying to see over the heads of the men, having to hop-hop to clear the tops of the tallest. As I moved toward them, all their eyes screamed various warnings at me. I ignored them.
“What’s up, chaplain?” I asked from perhaps twenty feet away and closing. A couple of the men peeled away from the pack, shaking their heads and, right before we collided, they hooked a sharp left up the stairs. There were still two others. As I approached, they fanned out to either side, giving me a clear view of Mrs. Dunston. A tragic, delicate sound emanated from her direction. She was wounded and looking down.
“George...it’ll die if you don’t help me.” I traced her gaze to the cricket she’d been shielding. Now that I could see it and the fact it was missing a hind leg, its chirping did sound like a distress call.
I suppose my posture revealed something to her and my remaining Christian brethren, for she sighed while they shook their heads mournfully and made their way to the stairs, muttering mockingly.
I hate bugs. Well, maybe “hate” is too strong a word, and I definitely wish them no harm. Nor is it exactly a phobia, though the thought of them crawling on me makes me shiver. It’s more an aversion - a visceral revulsion.
“It won’t hurt you.” Easy for her to say. How come she wasn’t scooping it up? It was right at her feet, not mine. As if sensing my thoughts, she backed away to give me plenty room to make a fool of myself. I figured, he’s only got one hind leg - how hard can it be to catch him?
A lot harder than I thought. See, he was bounce-bounce-bouncing around, frantic and unpredictable (due to his lopsided catapult system). Besides, I was trying not to squash him. My left hand clenched my Bible, and my other hand I shaped into a cup. I squat-hopped around the hall, attempting to herd the cricket into a corner. The best I could do was usher him toward a wall.
After a minute or so, I dripped sweat; and I was a bit annoyed with the chaplain’s frivolous encouragements: “Oh! Get him! Get him!” And, beneath the stare of an amused and bemused officer, I was somewhat self-conscious.
So I got serious. I took a deep breath, tucked my Bible under my arm to free up my hand, and spoke softly to the cricket. “Hey, little guy...calm down. I’m not gonna hurt you. Look, I don’t know how you got in here - maybe you made a wrong turn, or were tempted by the warmth and bright lights - but you made a bad decision. I’m trying to save you and set you free.” I also sent an emergency prayer flaring into Heaven.
Within seconds I had him cupped between one hand and the floor. I felt him ricocheting off what must’ve seemed like prison walls. To keep him from popping through the brief openings between fingers and floor, I brought my other hand into action and created a loose basket. Cradling the cricket, Mrs. Dunston and I, heads held high, marched over to the recreation yard door. I shouldered into it. Locked. We twisted around to find the officer. Who, with a facial expression saying he couldn’t believe how idiotic we were, spat, “You can’t just walk out there anytime you like. There are gun towers. If I had the door opened without first calling them, when you stepped out you’d be shot.”
To be honest, I didn’t see it as such a risk: crack the door, reach out, drop cricket, shut door. The gun towers guards wouldn’t even notice. He knew it too. “No! I am not going through all that trouble just so you can rescue a cricket.” He stomped away before we could reach him with reason.
The chaplain and I met eyes. Our spirits slouched. “Just set him by the door. Maybe he’ll escape next time it opens,” She said, dejected; and seeing no other option, I obeyed. With regret, I put him down gently and apologized, “I’m sorry, buddy. I did all I could.” Then we three parted ways.
I was fifteen or twenty feet down the hall when Mrs. Dunston called out, “George!” I stopped and spun round, a question on my face. “George, why did that happen?”
“What do you mean?” “Why would God allow that to happen? Why would He move our hearts to help a cricket, only to have a locked door stop us like that?” There was a deep, plaintive note to her question.
I fired off a bullet request for wisdom, and cocked my head for a second as I waited for God to answer…”Chaplain, God wanted us to understand He values the life of every creature. No matter how big or small, they are precious to Him - and ought to be us as well. Not only that, but success is not determined by outward results but by the heart. God called us to act, we obeyed. We were successful in service because our hearts were in the proper place and we did our best. The outward results are up to God, not us. We are called only to obey.”
She was near tears as she nodded. We both walked away simultaneously sad and uplifted.
Reminiscing like this, I can’t help but notice the parallels between the cricket’s plight and mine, complete with people of a higher standing in society struggling to help prisoners without knowing whether they’ll be “successful”. Nevertheless, they sense the call and compulsion of compassion in their hearts, and relentlessly sweat to save lives while the world watches - indifferently, bemusedly, indignantly, mockingly. On the surface, they seem to be regular human beings. It’s only when they are in a crisis, or become aware of a problem, that we see their capes streaming as they fly into action."

I tried finding new friends. I tried detox and rehab. I attempted suicide. Deep inside, I didn’t want it. After years of living dangerously, I ended up in a house with four girls who sold their bodies, four others who shoplifted, and one who robbed and stole. At this point the fun had been gone. It was pure survival at this point. I wanted help, but I wasn’t ready to change, nor was i committed to trying.
However, I was completely exhausted and was sick of my bullshit and my life. When it all came crashing down and the waves engulfed my body, I was under the influence of a couple of grams of coke, a couple of grams of heroin, 11 blue xanax, and 1/5th of Jose Cuervo Gold, and my girlfriend was selling herself to a friend of mine. After all that, we went out to a party.
My cousin got slapped by a friend, and I lost complete control of who I was and what I was doing. After flipping out on everybody I finally sat down with a bloody knife in my possession. A friend of mine dead, and the police calling my phone.
When the dust had settled I had robbed my cousin, beat up my girlfriend, and killed my friend. I told the blue where I was and what I had done step by step. My life was completely out of control, and I hated the monster I had become.
When the Police came to rescue me from the world and myself, I fully submitted and manned up to accept full responsibility. I am not some cold-blooded killer. I am not a bad person. I just made decisions to ride the wrong roads. I fully accept my fate, and I’m finally sober. The death was truly an accident, and God has allowed me a release date and another chance at life. To date, I have been sober for 3.5 years, obtained a GED, enrolled in several classes here in the prison for college credits. I’ve learned a lot about who I am and what I like to do. I’ve discovered this writing program, which allows me to express myself, without judgement.
I’m doing everything I can to learn about the real me and stay busy trying to find my purpose. This rescue has truly opened my eyes to the most wonderful things in life, and to the best people I’ve ever met.
For once in my life, I feel compassion for my fellow man. Even though I’m incarcerated, I’m truly happy. I look happily, every morning, at the rescued man God allowed me to become. I’m not perfect by any means, but I’m finally happy and I have peace in my heart. I have a family that has forgiven me, and loves me unconditionally, and I know what it feels like to be rescued."

Pamela’s drugs are very expensive. Even with the money she earned by medical transcription and prostitution, we faced frequent utility shut-offs and evictions.
My own skills were insufficient. North Carolina’s domestic relations procedures are bizarre. Divorce is complicated enough, but then property, support, and custody matters are handled separately!
Over a period of several years I amassed a huge collection of police reports, medical records and other evidence. When I had overwhelming evidence to prove an airtight case beyond any reasonable doubt, I took my children to the courthouse. In Massachusetts, I’d have been in and out in about twenty minutes, but we were in North Carolina.
Procedures in North Carolina are so different from those in Massachusetts and Tennessee that I had to feel my way as if I’d never tried a case before. After enduring incredible hardships, I won a court decree, but Pamela’s North Carolina lawyer advised her to disobey it. As I was getting ready to go to the courthouse to file a contempt petition, Sgt. King banged on my door and told me to open it.
“What if I don’t open it?” I asked. His reply was quite predictable. My dear, sweet landlady would have been very upset if he’d busted her door down, so I opened it.
Many people were outraged by my case. In most of the civilized world, the prosecutor must prove three things: 1.That an unlawful act was committed; 2. With criminal intent; 3. By the defendant.
I learned that North Carolina does not require any of those facts to give a person a life sentence. N.C.G.S. 5L-B was amended. It now requires the Clerk of Superior Court to provide domestic abuse victims with complaint forms. No one should have to go through what I did. Now help is available.
My children had to grow up without a father, and I’m still in prison. Somewhere, through the grace of God, a child is alive and intact. Through me, He has rescued many children. Knowing that helps me to go on."

Life isn’t a fairytale. Life is rough, mean and callous, but we never read of such truth in our days of innocence. When our hearts were full of love for plush toys and we could cry over sweet animated films so quickly with abandon! “I’ll pray for you” can often be overused. Almost like “Have a good one” or “Take care now” or “We’ll see you.” It’s supposed to mean something, and for many, it still does.
Odds are you have a prayer warrior somewhere praying for you today. Even if you never knew them. As hard as it can be to believe at times of incarceration it may even be a staff member or other state employee. You never know when God’s going to put something on someone’s heart. Prayer for me has never stopped. I go to church. I’ve been baptized for so long, about twenty years now. As I write this I’m thirty-two! That doesn’t mean my troubles stop. I’m in prison with a substantial amount of time. I was sent here with a 120.5 year sentence. Some ask, “Do you have all day?” Meaning what amounts to life, yeah, I guess that counts as all day, maybe some of the night too. That doesn’t mean I have to sink to some of the standards of other men in prison. God’s delivered me from that. That alone, even if it meant there was still no hope of salvation, is still being rescued in my book.
I see others. And I see how I could’ve been. More than that I’m a survivor. So many are shocked to see how I survived long enough to even be arrested. God must’ve sent an angel down so many times in my life. Whether you’re rescued by the hand of God or the police, you’re still going to repeatedly ask why. There has to be purpose or meaning to it all.
I think of Jeremiah 29:11: ‘“For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”’ Attorneys have abandoned me and taken advantage of me. Some people have tattoos. I have scars. Some are seen, some are unseen. But they all matter to those who love me, and to God. Especially to God.
One day late on a feeling though, and the courts will dismiss your brief with prejudice. I should’ve freaked out when every little thing went wrong or seemed to. But the spirit of God spoke to me. Telling me I’d pull it off whenever there was a problem or delay. God helped me meet my deadlines so many times and make the impossible or improbable possible. No, the responses weren’t always what I was looking for. They usually were the opposite. But God saw me through it all. I was rescued from my own death. From the hands of many men. I’m still here. God is still in prison. He didn’t leave when Jesus was crucified.
What I and others experience is often injustice. But we will live a victorious life over our circumstances. We’re being guided and we’re listening for his voice. I’m preparing myself for what’s next at every turn. And I hope others will seize their purpose and its inheritance. We were rescued, we were meant for such great things. I hope and pray anyone who reads this recognizes their rescue! And that they’re willing to take possession of their destiny."

Before coming to prison, I was the kind of person who found blessings in helping others. Unlike the priests, teachers, and volunteers I admire, I had my own selfish agenda. If I’m honest, I didn’t want to rescue anybody, not even myself.
When I first came to prison, I saw being rescued as a curse: though prison probably saved my life, it also caused me to suffer. Some days, I still wish I were dead. My victims may feel the same way.
I’ve been a screw up so long, I often think that being rescued is impossible. As a sex offender, I’m not seen as the most sympathetic character, so not many people are willing to give me a second chance--not that I had much of a chance to start with. I also struggle with self-hatred and bitterness, which makes most days feel like an endless war.
No matter how bleak things seem at times, I refuse to give up hope. Increasingly, I find salvation in my writing. The more I write, the more I understand about myself. By publishing my work, I gain acceptance and understanding from others.
Maybe I’ll be rescued after all."

God doesn’t ask my advice on how I want life to happen. As a human, if God did ask my advice, I’d mess things up by allowing my character defects of pride, lust, anger, greed, and gluttony to influence my decisions, or by letting emotions drive action instead of intellect.
Fantasy: In prison, and in life in general, a common behavior is creating fanciful scenarios of past experiences and personal histories. The reporting of a fantasy life on the outside is common inside prison. Some prisoners bum commodities and claim to have been millionaires on the streets; others claim to have been “Scareface” style drug kingpins, when in truth, they may have been a homeless street hustler, dope fiend, or prostitute.
Truth: The truths of my life contain a mixture of success and failure, a mediocre existence, nothing fancy or extravagant to report. I experienced success by working for two reputable companies in Atlanta, Georgia where I climbed the ranks and did well, until my worst enemy appeared, Mr. Ego, demanding more than life was giving.
I quit good jobs and forfeited lucrative careers because of Mr. Ego who drove pride with a distorted view of reality. The drugs I used altered my perception of truth. I told myself I deserved more money than I was earning. The companies weren’t paying me what I was worth. Those thoughts justified my struggle to survive with my unhealthy habits.
The truth was that I mismanaged my earnings and made unsound business decisions. I spent more money on shooting and smoking drugs than I did on rent, car payments, insurance, utilities, and groceries, which explains why a repo man chased me for months to take my car. I shot more drugs in a day than I could work and pay for in a week. I reverted to crime to cover the cost. When I landed in jail with multiple felonies, facing the rest of my life in prison, the truth set in and I wanted to commit suicide to end the pain caused by my past. I’m glad I didn’t choose to end my life.
Love and Pain: Things chance. Love and resentment kept me alive. I loved my family, and knew they loved me. I didn’t want to hurt them by killing myself even though I did sometimes feel their lives would be better without the pains I caused by living a self-centered life.
The resentment originated from my interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I refused to cooperate. The lead FBI agent said, “I’m going to put you in prison for the rest of your life.”
“I will kill myself before I let you do that,” I said.
His response: “Do it!”
That made me want to live to avoid satisfying him, and to live to see the day I could make him regret saying it. Today I am thankful for him. God used him to rescue me from an abyss filled with anger and self-hatred.
Thug Life: From a thug point of view, I lived a life filled with danger and excitement, by using guns to rob drug stores and other businesses to take what I wanted, using violence to accomplish my goals. Even inside prison, I lived the thug life by playing the drug game, running gambling operations, and making decisions that affected the lives of others through prison politics. In my youth, I did several things that gave me clout as a prisoner. For instance, I kept my mouth shut when arrested; in the Georgia prison system, I assaulted two guards and later escaped with 10 others by taking over a control room; made homemade wine and moonshine, sold drugs, and was later falsely accused of murdering another prisoner. I still held strong and did not rat on anyone. Those things happened many years ago when I was young and dumb, a phase most people seem to go through.
Retired: Seven years into this sentence, I retired from all the above because I tired of the associated drama. I was killing myself and acting insane by staying involved in dangerous situations to stay high and in control.
If God had not saved me from myself, my life of crime would have lead me to death row or the graveyard. I’m glad I was rescued, even though I do with the path hadn’t been so rough."

“I’ll be just outside on the porch,” I returned over my shoulder, walking out the door.
As I waited for Shawna I gently brushed my finger over the bluebird’s head and back, closely looking for injury. My eyes roamed over the bluebird’s beautiful, sky-blue plumage and chestnut breast. It sat unflinching and I marvelled at nature’s beauty. I didn’t see anything wrong.
Shawna came with some maple syrup mixed with winter. As I continued stroking our patient’s plumage, Shawna dipped her finger in the liquid and held a drop to the tip of the beak. The drop disappeared. Again she retrieved a drop and held it close to the bluebird’s beak. This time a tiny tongue licked the drop off her finger. With growing relief we took turns feeding drop after drop to our new friend.
Its heartbeat grew faster and it fluttered its wings. I felt its talons clinch my finger tighter and suddenly the little bluebird opened its eyes, spread its wing, and rapidly flew to the porch banister. There the bluebird seemed to take stock in itself. Satisfied, it look around with quick little flits of its head, stopped on us for a moment, and then flew to a nearby tree, landing on a limb. It gave us a sweet, mellow song and disappeared.
We stood holding each other. Shawna was weeping quietly and I could feel a tightening in my throat, my eyelashes damp. Clearing my throat I looked down at my beautiful wife, hugging her close.
“I’ll never forget this experience.” She said, kissing me tenderly.
“Nor I,” I say, returning her kiss. “I’ve never rescued anything before. It’s humbling.”
“Yes, yes it is. It’s a wonderful feeling.”"

I love the outdoors, the country quiet places and the mountains with small towns. But there is no place in the world like the experience of a big city. The sights, smells, food, people, car horns, smog, buildings, police sirens, and the overall feel of the big city is something that draws me in and keeps me mesmerized. The big city is almost the equivalent of the best drug. Once you get a taste, it leaves you feigning for more. I’m addicted to the fast, hustle, bustle, and lifestyle of the big city! Not everyone gets a chance to rip, run, and travel to big cities.
If you’ve never been far from home, I suggest everybody travel at least once to a big city.

The doctor visit itself only took a few minutes, but first, the grown-ups had to talk and sign papers. Afterwards, the grown-ups had to again, talk and sign papers. In between was the waiting. I was expected to sit quietly. I tried.
When that was done, we didn’t go straight home. We’d go shopping in one of the big department stores - Filene’s, Gilchrist’s, or Jordan Marsh. In nice weather, we’d spend a little time on Boston Common or in the Public Gardens. I loved the swan boats there.
Once a year, we’d go to see the Christmas lights. We’d do a little shopping. The big Boston stores were fun, but my mother always spent too much time in the clothing floors and not enough in the really fun departments - electronics, hobbies, sporting goods, and, most importantly, toys. If the store wasn’t too crowded, my brothers could go where they wanted, but I had to stay with my mother.
On the top floor of one of the stores - the attic, a huge space that seemed only to be used during Advent - there would be a long line to see Santa Claus. Ropes were set up to create a huge maze through which we’d file back and forth for over an hour. One could never spend much time with Santa, because by the time you got to him, you had to pee.
When I was eight, my parents rented out our house in Reading and began winterizing the summer place in Plymouth. Traveling to the city by car or bus was never as much fun as riding a train.
We never made the trip by boat. There are large boats and ships in Boston harbor and special rules no doubt, but I wish we’d cruised on up the coast of the Charles River at least once. “I love that muddy water.” I still fantasize about tooling up and down the river between Cambridge and Boston, past the Harvard sculling teams and the Back Bay.
Before I became a political prisoner, I got around a bit. I thought Denver was at least as beautiful as Rome, Paris, or London. The landscape was changing in Suffolk County.

However, when the work was done, we were free to do as we pleased. I learned how to ride horses. How to hunt proficiently with a bow, and how relaxing it could be fishing for bass in the early hours of the summer mornings. And of course there were the nights we’d spend camping in the woods.

To drive from one end of The Strip to the other would take at least one hour. Everything was crowded. I could not understand how it was possible that McDonald’s never ran out of food when there was always about fifty people in line at all hours. The buffets were so full that they could not seat any more people. For every one person that left a buffet, they let in one person. On the Fourth of July, I expected the same, but the court was empty. The wait at McDonald’s was three minutes. Driving down The Strip took ten minutes.
The fashion show mall was on The Strip. It was always crowded. If you needed help from a salesperson it would be at least a ten minute wait. There was a mall about forty minutes away from The Strip. I went on a typical Saturday and it was empty. In the department stores, one basically would have had to send out a search party to find another customer. The food court only had about thirty people eating there.
On The Strip there was a movie theater with about twenty screens. Each theater held between 300-500 people. Most of the time, all the theaters were packed. Twenty minutes away from The Strip, there was a movie theater. It had about fifteen screens. Each theater only held between 100-300 people. Most of the time, there were at least fifty empty seats, so you could enjoy the movie without having to sit right next to a stranger.
When I moved out of Vegas, I flew out at the airport. There was an eight story parking garage five minutes from the airport that was full of rental cars. The whole garage only had cars from about ten different rental car companies, which include AVRS, Hertz, and Enterprise.
The airport was the size of a small city. From the entry door until the doors of the plane, it might’ve been a two mile walk. There was a monorail that takes you to different parts of the airport. It was always standing room only and packed to the fullest. A simple burger at a fast food place costed ten dollars yet the lines were always twenty minutes long. You could always tell the difference between the arriving and those departing. Those arriving were always excited, hoping to win big at the casino tables. Those departing were always sad that they lost a lot of money or went into loads of debt, because they didn’t have cash at the moment to gamble. The runways all had planes, both arriving and leaving. They looked like parking lots. There was always a line of several planes waiting to take off, one after another, only minutes apart."

A small fraction of the profits went to schools. Most of the profits went into the general fund for the politicians to spend. Also, our cunning politicians began quietly choking off other sources of school revenue, which counteracted their extra lottery bucks. Worse, many stupid people wised up and quit buying lottery tickets.
Now Oklahoma schools are worse off than ever, but the politicians are doing great!

She treated everyone like it was the 1930’s in Oklahoma, so needless to say, I was beat, made to work hard as a child, and said goodbye to normality. That was then.
Today, most grandparents are either full-time caretakers of grandkids or part-time nannies for a single parent child of theirs. No longer is it a stigma to be raised by grandparents, and no longer do grandparents lead quiet, boring, lonely retirements.
The whole world has flipped over. Nothing is as it was. Is that a good or bad thing? It depends on the grandparents. It depends also on your own family dynamics. One thing for certain: seldom will grandparents refuse to accept the duty of being good parents to their grandchild who needs them. Thank God for grandparents. Amen?"

But you know what I think is the most amazing thing she’s ever witnessed? Life as it unfolded before her very porch steps over the last several decades. She’s watched generations of people come and go, live and die, laugh and cry. So if you were raised on her street, she knows everything about you and your family and can run your genealogy down better than a Maury Povich paternity test. Because mothers may lie, but not Mom’s eyes. Fortunately for some, she’s not one to gossip.
And never for a minute believe Mom can be fooled, for she has the ability to sum people or dress them down in the blink of an eye with equal exactitude. This is because she is a saint of the Lord’s and shares His Spirit; she knows what It knows. Put that in the bank, it will earn you interest.
Another truth that will benefit you about my grandmother: Do not rob, steal from, or cheat Mom. Karma is particularly vicious on this point, as are her neighbors.
Also now, her birthday, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, and Christmas have become Mom Appreciation Days, for which she shall be gifted accordingly.
Hers will be the first sidewalk shoveled after it snows.
The daily paper will be provided to her regularly by the first of her neighbors making a trip to the cornerstore. Sunday papers will be on the drunk across the street who used to have my grandfather pray for him all the time.
The fisherman will now courteously stop at her stoop when he drives through, so that from her porch throne, Mom need only voice her choices to receive his finest offerings. A half dozen clams will be thrown in, gratis.
She gave her car away years ago to my uncle. But if she still had it, it would be washed periodically and the block’s best mechanic would keep it maintained in perfect working order.
Certainly many of these perquisites are bestowed upon every neighborhood’s elderly, but Mom….ah, now Mom, she gets it all. The royal treatment. How long it will all last, I can’t say. That is the Lord’s domain. However, her reign shall endure until He calls her home. Long live the queen!

“Well if you didn’t like it why did you play?” Dad told me granddad thought about it for a second and then said, “We needed twelve people to have a team and my friends really wanted to play. If I hadn’t decided to play, we couldn’t have had a team, and I wanted to help my friends.”
That stuck with me. Still sticks. He played years of a sport he didn’t like, not for himself, but for his friends. He considered others as more important than himself. He fought in a war because it was his duty, and he fought for his friends beyond some patriotic ideal. Love, Honor, Duty. Those three things were important to him. In that, he exemplified his generation.
Sure, he was human and had his flaws, but he always sought to do the right thing. He died while I’ve been in. He was 85 and lived a full life. I miss him dearly, and wish we had more time. Still, I’ll never forget what he taught me by simply being himself."

He had me lay down on his bed while he kneeled at my feet. He squirted lotion up one leg and down the other, then proceeded to massage both my legs simultaneously from the feet to the inner thighs. Then he had me raise my legs and straddle my feet on his shoulders while he applied lotion to the bottom of my thighs. His face was so close; I felt his warm breath tickling my skin.
I laid my head back from watching him, closed my eyes, giving myself over to him. Suddenly, I shudder as pleasure waves through my arched body.

My father’s mother was the one out of the four that I could claim to have known, as she lived until I was in my late teens. I visited her on occasion during my youth.

He stopped drinking. He had a good respectable job that he eventually retired from. He had gotten control over himself and his temper.
By the time he made contact with his children, they wanted nothing to do with him. He tried to make up for his actions and wanted nothing more than to start over with them. They didn’t feel the same way. They couldn’t/wouldn’t forgive him.
I knew all of this, but it didn’t matter to me. I wanted to know my grandfather. My father refused. He said I could contact his “sperm donor” when I was no longer in his house.
My grandmother tried to help me in my endeavor to know my grandfather. She allowed me to stay in contact with my aunts (my grandfather’s sisters), Lovella and Estelle. They visited me at her house and we wrote letters that were sent through her address. They told me stories about him and told me all about him. I was fascinated by this mystery person that was my grandfather.
When I moved out and had my own child, I immediately got my grandfather’s address from my aunts and sent him a letter. I honestly didn’t think he would respond. Not only did he write me back, he drove from Colorado to Georgia to meet me and his great grandson.
The person I met was not the same person that had been described to me by my father. He had such a light about him; you couldn’t help but be happy when you were around him. He had the sweetest and most gentle nature. My son and I absolutely adored him.
I tried to get the rest of my family to see him, but they refused. My heart broke for him. I wanted him to know his children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and even my grandmother. I made a scrapbook and included pictures, histories, and funny stories about each person. I was told he treasured that book until he died. It was returned to me when he died-- it was well worn and used.
I am so thankful I had a chance to meet and grow close to my grandfather. Horrace Rogers gives me hope for humanity. He taught me that people really can change. People can do horrible things and still have a beautiful heart. They say people don’t change. My grandfather is proof to me that they are wrong."

The dining room was generally off limits. It’s door was kept closed. I occasionally got a look at the beautiful china, silverware and silver tea service back there, but those treasures were not to be touched, much less eaten off of.
The stove was big with a flat top from which a wire tool could be used to remove iron disks, with flames underneath. A big glass bottle was mounted above the fire, containing several gallons of kerosene. That made me nervous. When she made me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, she would always put butter in it. I didn’t like that, but I loved Grandma too much to say anything about it.
The living room was open to the kitchen. If it had a door, I don’t ever remember it being closed. In one corner was a beautiful wooden cabinet. When the doors were opened, a small TV screen and controls were revealed. My grandmother watched Billy Graham whenever he came on and several daytime soap operas. Tea was occasionally taken in the living room, but most of the activity in my grandmother’s apartment took place in the kitchen.
The bathroom was fairly big and well lit. There was a box mounted above the toilet. One pulled a metal chain to flush. When I was little, it was hard to reach.
The bedroom door was usually open. Grandma’s chamber was clean and neat. The bed was made as if no one ever slept in it. I don’t have any memory of ever going in there.
There were porches across the front of the building. Annie’s was enclosed by glass. Grandma’s was open to the air. It was close enough to town that one could occasionally smell the ocean, but we seldom went out there.
As she got older, stairs became a problem at our house and hers and elsewhere. Then they became an architectural barrier and her children put her in a nursing home. Annie also moved into a ground floor apartment under cousin Anne.
My grandfather had been a successful banker through the depression. He had diabetes for many years until he left a substantial inheritance to each of his six children. There was much discussion about the distribution of assets, some of it which was unpleasant. My grandmother passed away in a nursing home at the age of approximately 104."

In the 1970’s, my dad showed me a picture on the frontpage of the Pulaski newspaper. It was of my granddad standing there, in front of his apartment front door, pointing his red tipped cone towards something on the door, and a policemen looking at it with a sheepish grin on his face. Someone had tried to kick in the door while my grandad was there. He was well known in that town, along with his handicap, so the would-be-intruder marked him as an “easy” target.
Little did he know, a blind man's aim can still be fairly true, and as the thug was kicking on the well-made door, my granddad was aiming his 32 snubnose aligned atop his cane towards the noise… Five shots were sent through the door, which sent the would-be-robber limping away, and later caught at a local hospital.
Many years later, I went to visit him, as a young man with a girlfriend by my side. He seemed much smaller, almost frail, but still sharp and aware as ever. Still alone. This would be my final visit, for the years afterward would lead me to a place too far away to visit again, so it seemed.
My life blurred for a while. Family and friends either disappeared or gradually became people I no longer knew.
I received a letter at work in the middle of pulling a transmission from a vehicle. I’m guessing it was the only address my uncle could trace me to, probably by the SSN number.

Unbeknownst to me until I was informed in recent years, my great grandmother made such a sacrifice and expressed love for me and my sisters. Food in Mrs. Murphy’s (my grandmother’s) home was scarce, and what little there was often contained more dead insects of various sorts than actual food. Little did I know, Mrs. Murphy had been starving to death slowly in order to feed us. At the time, the government would give her one meal a day as a senior citizen, and she divided this amongst my sisters and myself. This resulted in a quick deterioration of her health, requiring hospitalization. My sisters and I were taken to live in a foster home at this point.
While living in her home, I followed my elder brother in terrorizing the chickens and ducks, creating all sorts of havoc around the property (there was quite a bit of acreage). Although, at seven years of age, I could see how my behavior hurt her, I did not desist in my delinquent behavior. Yet, she never stopped loving or sacrificing for us.
In retrospect, I wish that I could go back in time and amend my past behavior, spend more time with her, and express how much her sacrifice means to me. But this cannot be done, and so, with great sorrow and anguish, I must go on.
Not one of us is promised tomorrow. Life is full of uncertainty. Knowing this, does it not stand to reason that we must make the most out of every opportunity presented to us?
Finally, grandparents, so often neglected and taken for granted by their posterity, are oftentimes the individuals in each of our lives who have made the greatest impact on us, who showered us with affection we could not get from uncaring or indifferent parents, and who made that ultimate sacrifice for us, showing us the greatest of love. How many of us have grandparents who are still living? Do we let them know how much they and their sacrifices mean to us?
To those who would brush aside my essay as meaningless or as of no importance, allow me to say this: do not allow the opportunity to spend time with your grandparents to be squandered. If you do, you will end up like myself, hoping for the possibility of a reunion in another life with the chance to make amends as your only consolation. Your only assurance and companion in this life will be regret."

When you look at your parents, can you find the fear of aging in those eyes? Then in a mirror, can you see the grandparent you are, will be, or never will be, and cry?
Everyone dies. Some grow old; others are taken when they’re young. The things you own will flutter off to others and eventually turn to rubbish. Fears and hope will flicker away in the blink of an eye. Maybe a piece of you will escape to a land of bliss or sorrow, so what will you leave behind? Memories. You’ll live in other’s minds as a hero, a sad and lonely song, a tyrant, a thief, a killer, a friend, or another person just seeking happy times. Some will fade, never having had the experience of knowing a loved parent, grandparent, child, or friend. Death is the truth of the world. Some will write words upon a page that last, and others will create visions of beauty. Everyone wants to live forever, and some turn to hide in their minds, knowing that life may be pointless in the end. In all they teach us, good or bad, grandparents all have something we can watch and learn from as they age. They teach us what it means to age, to fade away, and pass on only to live in memory."

He had died of heart failure while my mom was still a child. My grandmother, Oleta, was a decent woman. She was once arrested in the early 80’s for bootlegging. For years she would sell, excuse me, resell beer out of her home. See, Garland was a dry city in a wet country. You had to drive into Dallas or Plano for beer. She just saved some folks a trip. She was also a pack-rat. I mean a real, bad pack-rat. When we went to her house, it was almost standing room only. She had a trail, a one-foot wide path, from the front door to the back, and each room in the house. At her house there was always candy, snacks, a Dr. Pepper or other soda (Root Beer!), and, of course, a beer. Well, at least until the arrest. One thing she had I wish I had the courage to ask her for was her black, fast-back Barracuda, but my cousin one day totaled it. I don’t know what year the car was, but I wish I had asked her for that car. I would have loved and babied it. Sadly, we lost my grandmother about five or six years ago.
Now, I also had a third set of grandparents. My adopted grandparents from my adopted father from Mom’s second marriage. They too were good people. They had a total of about 12 kids. They lived in the city of Wylie, just north of Garland on Highway 78. They were in Collin County and had Lake Lave to their north. Their house was right in front of Wylie High School, home of the Fighting Pirates. Their entire backyard was a dedicated home garden. I can still remember every fall, helping to shell peas and snap green beans for canning, and shelling pecans too. This was fun because you could eat a few pecans as you worked. You just had to keep more than you ate. Thanksgiving and Christmas were huge affairs at their hours. Naturally us kids had a table apart from the adults in the living room. Those meals were huge, and no one went home empty-handed. Granddad Durst was also a Navy Vet. He kept a picture of the cruiser he served on right above his chair in the living room. He and Grandma both loved to fish as well. I can remember many weekends in early fall of going up the Sabine River from where it flowed into Lake Tawakani. You would think that some of the family had gotten together and planned an event, but no one did. My parents and I would come up river and pass an uncle’s camp, then my grandparents, then another uncle. There would also be people we didn’t know here and there. We would make our camp, then go back to visit with family.
Now, when I was real little in the 70’s I do remember visits to my great-grandparents. These were my adopted dad’s grandparents. Big Mama and Big Daddy (though he was frail and in a wheelchair) were wonderful people. Big Mama loved to cook and to feed her “children.” Every time we went to visit, if there wasn’t a full meal, there was at least a side table covered in cakes, pies, and such. We always went home with something. They truly loved one another and were still living independently at their ages. After Big Daddy passed, Big Mama didn’t stay with us long. Without him, she figured it was time. I miss those two most of all.
Sadly, I should know more about all my grandparents. I should be able to fill volumes with their stories, wisdom, and teachings. But I can’t. Too much time spent at play and chasing girls. Not enough was spent with them, or even with my parents for that matter. Don’t make my mistakes. If it’s not too late, spend time with your grandparents. For those of us in our 40’s and up, our grandparents were part of the “greatest generation.” They stood against the Nazis, Fascists, and the empire of Japan. Some stood against the Communists in Korea. For you younger folks 30’s and down, yours’ stood against the Commies in Vietnam. They saw Elvis and the “British Invasion.” They witnessed the beginnings of the Cold War and saw the Cuban Missile Crisis. Ask them where they were when the Kennedy brothers, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcom X were killed. Ask them about watching men go into space, and then to the moon. Where were they when Neal Armstrong touched the moon?
There’s a lot of life behind those old eyes and crow’s feet. Don’t let the wrinkles and age spots fool you. Their minds are sharp and full of years of earned wisdom. Spend time with them. Talk to them. Do with them the things they enjoy or love, even if you don’t like those things. You just might afterwards."

Now, though I’ve studied all different beliefs, I’ve come right back to what my grandparents were taught. I’m not saying it's right but it’s what is right for me, and in the long run, it’s what makes me want to live better, and try harder; and it keeps my family genes and beliefs in place.

But I have no trouble believing it to be true, considering the dysfunctional way she lived when I did talk to them. My Aunt Monique was a drug addict and a drunk who let her kids run around naked (not that I complained). My grandmother was a drunk and a compulsive gambler; most of my memories of her revolve around tagging along to her AA meetings and bingo halls. When I could track her down, she was constantly moving from place to place to avoid bill collectors. These factors made it hard to get to know her. They also led to our eventual estrangement.
Because my mom was under 21 when she had me, she couldn’t legally serve as my guardian; therefore, she couldn’t serve as the executor of a wrongful death lawsuit that was filed against the transportation authority by my grandmother on my behalf. Since it was for an undisclosed amount, I had no way of knowing how much I was set to inherit, but rumor had it that it was in the six-figure range. In the end, though, it didn’t matter. My grandmother stalled me out as long as possible. By the time I got the money shortly after my 21st birthday, all that was left after court fees and taxes was a few thousand dollars. Though no dollar amount could erase the pain of having grown up without a father, I can think of a lot better ways to have spent it than on drinks and bingo chips. (Ironically, that’s pretty much how I spent my portion of it.) I still hold a grudge against Grandma Frank for pretending she was looking out for my best interests, only to screw me out of my inheritance. But I guess she’s paying her personal hell for doing so: I hear she’s in poor health, most likely the result of all those years of chain smoking and drinking at my expense.
My mom’s family isn’t much more stable.
My great-grandparents were the Hodinskys, both of whom were the first generation American children of Polish and Ukrainian immigrants who came to the Philly area to work in the factories during the Depression. Grandpa Hodinsky drank himself to death before I was born, but I’ve heard stories about how he had done prison time for bootlegging and armed bank robbery. By the time I met Grandma Hodinsky, who we grandkids called “Nanny,” she was a feeble old lady who depended on others to get around, chain-smoked Lucky Strikes, and loved watching “The Price is Right.” In her old black-and-white pictures, Grandma Hodinsky was quite a catch in her day, a real-life Betty Boop. With her hourglass figure, big breasts, big brown eyes and short curly brown hair, and a cigarette constantly dangling from her lips, she must’ve been quite a sex symbol back then… or at least Grandpa Hodinsky thought so. He married her as soon as legally possible and started a family immediately. They ended up having four children, all girls. My grandmother, Regina, was their middle child.
When she was 16, Regina got pregnant by an older boy named Bobby McKeown. They got married shortly before my mom, Joanie, was born. Considering Grandpa Hodinsky’s past, I’m willing to bet it was a “shotgun wedding” indeed. Two years later, my Aunt Jackie was born.
According to family legend, Grandpa McKeown went out for milk one night and never found his way home. Truth is, my grandmother divorced him because he was such an abusive asshole who beat her constantly. My mom and Aunt Jackie were scarred by the abuse he doled upon them. He also carried on an affair with a girl not much older than my mom. Because of this, he and my mom didn’t speak much. My relationship with him was strained by emotional and physical abuse and empty promises to the point that I decided to stop talking to him as soon as I was able to make my own choices.
My grandmother went on to marry a guy named Petey, who was even more abusive than my grandfather. In addition to beating my grandmother, Petey also had a tendency to point guns at people’s heads and to shoot up the house whenever he got drunk, which was pretty much every night. Thankfully, Petey was gone before I could form any lasting memories of him.
My mom seems to have inherited my grandmother’s poor taste in men. Shortly after my dad died, she hooked up with a guy named Bobby Kercko. She fell in love with him because he was tall, dark, and handsome, had his own car and a steady job, which was more than most guys his age could say. He was also good with me and treated her well. My mom married Bobby when I was three. Not long afterward, Bobby started beating my mom, often right in front of me-- sometimes so severely that she had to go to the emergency room. I felt so helpless because I couldn’t stop him. I still have nightmares about those beatings. They’re still married and Bobby still drinks and does drugs, and occasionally lashes out at my mom. I don't understand why they’re still together. But I guess they’re just following the example that their own parents set.
Like my mom, Bobby came from an abusive home. His dad was a Korean war vet; his mom was a hula dancer who his dad had met while stationed in Pearl Harbor. Bobby’s dad would get drunk and beat his mom, Bobby, and his siblings.
With so much dysfunction running so deeply on both sides of my family, no wonder I turned out the way I did. Oh well, at least it gives me plenty to write about!"

He was a surveyor and mining engineer and was the official Idaho state mining inspector for many years. I remember going to the state capitol building to see him sometimes. He would take us with him on his projects, showing us how to use his equipment. He also taught us how to fish and camp outdoors in the mountains. He loved to cook and bake. He taught my next oldest sister and I how to make peanut brittle, fudge, suckers, divinity, penoche… and the hardest was saltwater taffy (at least for 10 and 12 year olds). It’s so tiring to “pull” the taffy as it would never quite come out right: a light tan, hard as rock candy that tasted like hardened powdered sugar, butter and vanilla. We always ate it though.

My maternal grandmother was a school teacher. She was a lovely, nice lady. I don’t remember her when she was a functioning person though. By the time I started to recollect memories, she was already sick. She was in a car wreck and it caused a “hardening of the arteries” in her brain which caused Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, and her mind regressed into a childlike state, which worsened until she died. My dad wouldn’t allow her to be put in an old-folks’ home either. The story goes: she asked him to promise to never put her in a home. This was before she lost her faculties. She lived with us when she died in 1981. I was 13 years old and she was around 76 years old. Her name was Margaret Louise Hadfield Pratt-Hansen. I wish I could have known the real her."

I ate so much that I got sick, ate some more, and got sick again. A wonderful day! A wonderful memory

Since I worked during lunch and dinner rush hours, I spent most of my shift in a hectic state. Every night, I’d go home bone-tired and reeking of burger and fry grease. All of the grease wreaked havoc on my complexion which was already plagued with acne. I was miserable but stuck it out because being broke sucked even more.
Then I met Andy… Andy was 40, had been working there since he was my age, still lived with his mother, drove the IROC he’d saved up to buy back when he was still in high school, and lusted after cheerleaders. If that wasn’t sad enough, he seemed content with his pathetic existence. The thought of becoming Andy scared me so much that I quit the next day.
Unfortunately, with no education or job experience, I wasn’t qualified to do anything but work in fast food. I ended up working at McDonald’s until after I graduated high school.
After high school, I got a job as a cartboy/cashier at Kmart. Though slightly better than fast food, working in retail was its own special kind of hell. Once again, I found myself spending all day on my feet, doing mind-numbingly repetitive tasks. And even worse, I dealt with rude, demanding customers. Before long, I found whatever excuse I could to get out of doing my duties, often hiding out in the layaway loft or goofing off in the sporting goods and toy aisles with the neighborhood kids until I eventually got fired.
I spent the rest of my early adulthood bounding between “service” jobs, never lasting longer than a year before quitting or getting fired. I guess holding a regular job has never been important to me. Work has always been a means to an end, something better off avoided if at all possible. I guess that’s part of the reason I ended up in prison.
As I write this, I can’t help but note the irony of how similar to Andy I turned out being. Like him, I’ll most likely work in fast food well into middle-age. Unlike him, however, I won’t do it out of choice: as a convicted sex offender who will have served 31 years in prison, my career options don’t look too promising. That is, if there even is such a thing as fast food in 2034. Who knows? By then, we may all be Soylent Green…"

I didn’t have the job for long. My parents got a divorce soon after I started the job, and between that and the onslaught of hormones, I lost interest in working.

I learned not everyone liked policemen in the early ‘70s, which was confusing for this 6 year old because my dad was a policeman, and I was sure he hadn't done anything to the 6 year olds I was around. When those other kids talked bad about my dad or picked on me because of him, I ended up fighting. Fighting was against the rules, and so I got in trouble with the teachers, which got me in trouble with my dad. I just couldn’t win! I wanted to please both the teachers and my dad, but I didn’t want to get beat up (2nd graders are viscous).
Many times, I cried on my way home with lumps and scratches from fights with bigger, and even gangs of, boys. My dad would tell me there's nothing he could do--what? Aren’t people like him (fathers, cops) supposed to protect people like me from people like that? I was beginning to see why some people didn’t like policemen. What a hard lesson for a first grader, huh? My job was hard enough with ABC’s and 1,2,3’s, and stuff like adults can lie and even say, “Do as I say, not as I do.” Being a kid was the hardest job of all, but I pulled it off by putting myself on autopilot and acting instead of reacting.
Remember when I mentioned I completely missed the real point of the value and lessons of my first job? That’s what happened with my first real job: life. I unplugged and coasted through high school, the military, and even a war in some extreme combat on auto-pilot. I never accomplished anything that really mattered or made an impact on the world around me. Auto-pilot is no way to go through life. Like cruise control, you still have to steer and watch where you’re going or you’re going to crash. I crashed in a big way that I’ll probably never recover from.
What should I have been getting from my job? Stamina and staying power. A good name and mutual respect from my peers. That physical and inner strength from persevering when I really wanted to quit. Integrity, a new viewpoint, and good outlook from listening to that grumpy, mean boss who certainly knew more than I did about what I was doing and about where I was going.
It’s funny how growing is a learning process, and learning is a growing process. I’ve grown and learned that my “First Job” is to live and do right. To do it with as much integrity as possible. It’s never too late for you to learn this. Good luck with your “first job”!"

The job was mechanical like a textbook. For excitement, I began to toss handfuls of candy in bags instead of the required one piece. Lonely lunch breaks were spent meandering for trills. Heavily under the influence of marijuana and filled from the fried donut ball and apple cider free to employees, plus two cheeseburgers, fries, and an elephant ear with powdered sugar, a woman asked for a light. I hurried off realizing it was minutes passed my lunch break. The fourth day, during lunch, the woman returned my lighter and asked if I would join their “group of women” table. Surprised I was 15, they were interested in me, and I later explored the possibility of dating a cider woman. From that day forward, those were my lunch buddies, especially my new friend. Although the job was easy, had free boxes of candy (OK, OK, I was selling candy but only one box a night), and was with a cute woman, 20 years my senior and a crush on me, it wasn’t enough for me to stay. The plan was to pick up my check and never return.
The six days were colorless. The strong desire for something refreshing was unfulfilled. Lunch, the livest hour, provided intellectual conversation that captured my attention only for a moment. Come Saturday, I was going to blow this joint. No goodbyes, no farewells.
One hundred, seventy-five dollars. Not bad for one week of nothing. No second thoughts about departure. I greeted the familiar faces and left. Almost in the parking lot, thinking about what I was going to get into until a soft voice stopped me dead in my tracks. Oh! She was a beautiful new employee who asked where the office was. I introduced myself and sparked a conversation while leading her to the office. All of a sudden, the idea of abandoning ship was postponed. Finally, a purpose to stay. A new plan: make the new girl smile."

I was a shift manager at McDonald’s. I worked there for a while until I realized, “Hey, I’m not making ends meet. I am falling behind on my bills…”
So that led to my first side job selling a little weed, which never hurt anybody, right? Wrong! That led to five people trying to rob me with a 2x4 with nails in it, which led me to killing a young man. And that’s how I received my 28 year prison sentence.
I came to a prison in 2011 on voluntary manslaughter, 4 felonious assaults, and 2 trafficking of marijuana, and upon arrival, I had my first job: prove myself as a strong man who wasn’t going to become a victim inside the belly of the beast. When it all started, two black guys showed up at my cell and said, “Hey white boy! What ya in for?” I stood up without hesitation, and I punched the biggest of the blacks. As he went down, I moved to his buddie. We fought for a little while before my cellie let us know that the C.O.s were coming. I yelled at them as they were leaving, “I ain’t no white boy. I’m a white man!”
That mentality has been my first job inside the joint, but as I got older and been inside for a few years now, I realized that my most important job is staying healthy and safe, and making it to my out date. I grew to realize that my first job should be focusing on reaching my freedom, instead of what others want you to be doing like fighting and bickering. Our first job is about our freedom: understanding your rights, since guards will try to get to you every chance they can. They hate when a prisoner knows the policies and educates other prisoners. Take the time to learn the proper way to keep yourself protected. Know how to access what you need, when you need it, and always stay focused on your freedom!"

“Yes, I am him.”
“How would you like to begin training for a job with the Chicago Transit Authority?”
Excited, “I’d love it!”
“Well we can have you come in tomorrow to begin training.” After he gave me the address to the training facility, I ran upstairs to tell my parents the good news. After a two week course on bus driving and safety, I was assigned to a bus garage about a mile from my home.
Two weeks into the job, I ran into an old acquaintance at a restaurant during a lunch break. He invited me to his house after work, and that night, we drank beer and Hennessy while catching up on what each of us had been doing. He told me that he was “selling girl”: I thought he meant women, but to drive his point home, he left the room to grab two large ziplock bags, one of which was filled with marijuana and the other half-filled with cocaine.
“This is the girl I was talking about. A lot of money is to be made in that bus garage of yours; city paychecks be fat!” As he continued, I thought that he may be onto something. He told me that he could set me up with some work, a pager, and some experience on how to cut and bag the product. I bought in, and with my next paycheck, I purchased an eight ball of cocaine (which cost $300 in 1984) and a pager.
Overnight, I became a drug dealer with a friend who was right. Bus drivers, office workers, repairmen, and servicemen were all he said and more. Within a couple months, my bank account grew from $700 to $7,000. I was the man!
One customer wanted me to stay while he cooked the cocaine, to see if my product was what I said it was. I sat down while he added baking soda, placed the cocaine in a tube, added water, and began heating it with a makeshift torch fashioned from a wire hanger and cotton ball doused in grain alcohol. After the process was complete, he placed a small amount on a glass pipe and lit it. He nodded his head in approval then offered the pipe to me.
“Naw man. I don’t mess with that stuff.”
“One hit’s not going to kill you or have you hooked.” Good, old curious George couldn’t walk away. I had my lips wrapped around the pipe for the first time and went to heaven. I sat there and smoked everything on me, about $800 of merchandise. The next day, I withdrew money from my bank account, convinced that I would receive my losses on the next package. It never happened: before I knew it, I was living paycheck to paycheck, copping a package and fooling myself that I could stop at any time.
To make matters worse, a close friend of mine worked at a drug house selling cocaine and heroin. Once he had a mirror of heroin, and when I asked if I could try it, he warned me that it’s nothing to mess with.
“I’ll be the judge of that,” I told him. After that, I often said that cocaine and heroin had been united in holy matrimony.
One day, I went to work high off both cocaine and heroin, flying through the bus yard like a bat out of hell. I had an accident with another servicer, and we were taken to the hospital for a drug and alcohol test. Needless to say, that was the end of my first job."

The plug-ins were in the rafters of an awning to one side of the clubhouse, and were also like high-rise apartments for spiders. Getting covered in webs probably isn’t that big of a deal for someone who isn’t arachnophobic. I however am arachnophobic. I wonder all these years later what the people whose houses were closest to the clubhouse thought of the shrieking and cursing that came from there early on weekends? Probably the same thought they had about the shrieking and cursing when I had to plug the carts back up in the afternoons.
Raking sand traps was a zen experience. There’s a technique to it where you rake it loose and smooth it out in the same back-and-forth motion and you get this rhythm going, and even though your hands are blistering and you’re sweating like a beast, it doesn’t seem so hard. Until zen is broken by raking up dog crap, a dead opossum, or diving out of the way of the golf ball whacked at you by the guy who looked right at you and did it anyway. Then it’s back-and-forth, Grasshopper, back-and-forth.
I learned things though, like the reason all greens have a checkered appearance is because each day I had to mow them in a different direction, kinda like a compass. I also learned that an engineering maniac must have designed the mower because while it was self-propelled if I cranked the throttle fully I could sprint behind it. Who needs turbo on a walk-behind mower? And yes, I did try it. It was fun, and pissed off my boss, but worth it.
It was hard work. Much tougher than any fast-food restaurant, but despite that I ended up enjoying it. The rafter-spiders and I came to an uneasy truce, I loved working outside even on cold days, plus I’d get a free lunch at the grill, and at sixteen a free cheeseburger is like gold...greasy, delicious gold.

We had to keep water in this box, but if too much, the buns got soggy. Too little water, and the buns dried out. Here on this table we also had a Nacho chip warmer so we could serve up nachos. We had a cheese pump/warmer that we put gallon cans of Rico’s cheese into. This warmer had to have a little water in it for the cheese can to sit in. Then we inserted the pump into the cheese.

I’ve been to the store several times to pocket some chocolates, pastries, and anything else that was accessible to my brothers and me. Now that I found myself working for the same store I stole from.
My dad woke me earlier than usual to let me know that the papers I was supposed to deliver were on the front porch. I was excited to actually have a job and go to work.
I loaded up about 75 papers and delivered them in a little under an hour. By the time I was finished, I realized that the work wasn’t all that hard. Frits explained to me that the more papers I delivered, the more money I could make. By the third week, I added two more routes to my delivery. Instead of delivering 200 papers, I delivered 600 papers in roughly 6 hours and received 88 marks a week, about $60.
My entire weekend was consumed by paper delivery. I had no time for anything else but work and was already beginning to get tired of responsibility. When I received my check, I couldn’t think about anything else but making more. Another two weeks went by, and I decided to call my boss.
I informed Frits that I wanted to increase my route and needed another 400 papers, bringing my total to a thousand papers. Frits was astonished but apprehensive because in all the years he worked at his parents’ store, no one ever requested a thousand papers to deliver at one time.
For the first week, Frits monitored my progress and made sure I completed my route. It took me damn near the entire weekend, Saturday and Sunday, to complete my route. I tried to employ my little brother, but he quit after 45 minutes worth of hard labor. After about a month of deliveries, I was ready to quit myself.
One weekend while taking a break from my deliveries, I sat at the foot of the Rhine River and watched the many ships drift by. I still had around 200 papers, and the night sky began to blink at the world around me. Sitting there, I wondered why don’t I just dump these last 200 papers into the river? Who’s going to know?
Looking around, I grabbed an arm full and threw them into the river. I watched the once crispy sales paper turn into gray clumps of mush, disappearing under the weight of the water. The following week, I dropped 400 papers into the river after I delivered the other 600 hours earlier. I did this for about 2 months before Frits informed me that he received complaints about customers not receiving their sales paper. I asked who was complaining, and he surprisingly told me who the individuals were: there were 7 people.
By this time, I was now only delivering 200 papers out of the entire thousand and was collecting a check of 350 marks a week plus a 20 mark bonus. At eleven years old, I was making almost $700 a month for two hours of work a weekend.
Now, instead of making a thousand deliveries, I only made 7. My good fortune lasted for almost a year, and by 8 months, Fruits delivered 1300 sales papers to my parents front porch every weekend. The stacks of papers were so abundant that it looked like I was delivering papers all throughout Europe. I didn’t even think there were 1300 people in my small neighborhood, and I was right.
I was blinded by greed, and the river fed my desire beyond reason. One evening while making my weekly delivery to the mouth of the river, I caught a glimpse of something from the corner of my eye. There were wild animals that lived along the river, but for some reason, the image I saw was much larger than any of those animals. Thinking nothing of it, I went home to retrieve the rest of the papers.
Just as I finished throwing the second load into the river, I saw something move quickly out of sight. This time, I thought I saw a person; my heart drop. What if someone saw me. Would they report me? Was it someone visiting graves nearby?
When I returned home, my entire family was waiting outside for me, and so was Frits Wiessen. By the look on my mother’s face, I knew something wasn’t right. As I approached my house, my brother said, “Ohhh, you are in trouble. Mr. Frits saw you dump those papers in the water!”"

Each path seemed to lead to another dead end. Sarah panicked as she couldn’t locate the other three, so she screamed slightly over and over until they located her.
Although the group was together again, still no one had any inkling of which way to proceed. They mutually decided to go back where they started from, but this point could not be located!
One person, a tall lanky older man, passed by them too quickly to even ask for directions. Apparently, everyone else in Santa Barbara, and those from out of town, had all opted to watch the parade. With no one to ask for help, they decided to stay close together and choose a single path, preferably one that led to the car. When they came upon a bench next to a barely-bubbling brook, they decided to rest and have lunch.
Through the trees’ tops they spied the sun high overhead. Someone commented that it was already noon. The tree tops, the bubbling brook, the sun’s warmth, and the fat tree trunk that lay nearby all made for a cozy lunch of French rolls, cheese chunks, a gallon of white wine, and some doobies.
Exhausted from the morning hike, they lingered long over lunch next to the bubbling brook. But they still had to find their way out! None of them had had any breakfast, so all of their stomachs were still growling. They made tentative plans for the Sizzler later.
First on the agenda was to find their way out of the beautiful Fourth of July mountain trails! Path after path yielded no hope in finding their way back to where they had started.
As night began to fall, the four travelers lost all hope of ever returning to their starting point below. It was tremendously dark as they approached what appeared to be a flat area near the top of the mountains.
They stood still, experiencing the pitch blackness and quiet all around them. Up above, they saw hundreds of stars barely illuminated. A helicopter suddenly appeared as Matt and Sarah stood arm in arm. Confused and bewildered, they suddenly realized the helicopter was landing on the flat area they stood by.
This was when the four of them realized they had gotten so utterly lost that a helicopter had arrived to airlift them off the top of the mountain."

When I get out, I have no home or job to return to, no one waiting to take me in. I have no contact with the remnants of my abusive and toxic birth family. My two children are both grown, Tori with her career as a graphic designer and own home with her boyfriend, and Reid ensconced in his college life at film school. Of all the people who once populated my life, only my ex-wife and a scant four friends want anything to do with a felon, especially a sex offender.
After prison, I’ll be beyond homeless. I’ll be completely rootless, untethered, adrift. And if I have no clue where there is how the hell do I find my way? So, yeah, I guess I am lost, after all. Go figure.
Thinking about it, if I go by the qualifier of “No clue where there is,” I realize I’ve been lost, to one extent or another, most of my life. I’d just been going along with no real destination or plan. Everything that ever really worked out successfully for me, be it relationships, jobs, whatever, pretty much fell into my lap without any real goal setting, foundation laying or proper up keeping on my part. That’s probably why precious few of those things, notably that tiny handful of remaining friendships, ever stood the test of time.
In essence, I’ve spent a half-century as not much more than a passive observer in the journey of my life. I’ve really just been an often oblivious passenger in the car, watching the scenery go by, not even being so much as a backseat driver.
And the irony here is that I’m one of those rare males who never hesitates to pull over and ask directions when I need to. But if you just go through life living in the moment to a fault, only in the here and now, with no clear idea of where you’re heading, how can you possibly even know that you’re not lost? And if you don’t know you’re lost, you’re not likely to pull over and ask directions. And, to take the analogy one step further, if you’re not even the one driving…
Yeah, I’m pretty damned lost. Like that night years ago after my niece Jeny’s wedding. There we were, packed in the Plymouth Voyager-- my 78 year old mother, 9 year old Tori, 7 year old Reid, and a very stressed out me behind the wheel -- lost late at night on the outskirts of New Jersey's Pine Barriers. No grid-work blocks like this city boy is used to, no traffic lights or street signs, no bars on my cell phone, no gas stations. Just dark, winding, free lined roads, and mounting frustration anger at yourself, and fear, all of which I had to fight to hide. And oh yeah, three passengers openly expressing all those emotions. Obviously, we found our way out of the woods that night. (It helped that I eventually spotted a gas station and made a bee line for it!)
But where do I pull over to ask directions on this kind of road trip? Generally spacing, the staff here isn’t breaking a sweat to help with issues down the road and beyond these fences. My two best buddies, Jesse and Travis, are the only people here I truly trust, but as brothers, not necessarily life coaches. Who does that leave? My kids? My ex? Those few friends who still write? And how can I even ask any of them for directions if I still don’t know where the hell I’m going physically and metaphorically? I can’t wait for my goal to find me, as I did with my former marriage and my former career as a journalist. That travel plan--or lack of a plan--only ever led me to some pretty regrettable destinations: divorce, unemployment, addiction., mental illness isolation and ultimately, prison. Failure is once again preordained if I don’t first decide where I’m heading, and then set my course and prepare for the journey.
Which is why, while I sit here, it’s up to me to choose where there is. And then I have to finally do what I’ve never really done before: Take the wheel and drive the car."

I frantically look around. The acoustics of the mountains make it hard to clarify where it’s coming from. There! I see a small airplane soaring through the trees in the distance. I’m saved! The last argument with my wife was worse than ever. I’m glad she didn’t think I left her. I’m sorry for doubting her. I jump up and down waving my arms, screaming at the top of my lungs. “I’m over here!” I ignore the dizziness. A miscalculated step sends my feet flying over my head. Everything goes black.
I wake up covered in snow. My body’s cold and numb, but also feels like it’s warming up. Hypothermia. The thought of closing my eyes and giving up was quickly overtaken by the image of my wife and kids. I miss them. I must stand tall.
My body erratically convulses as I painfully stand up and limp back to my cave. Tears trickle down my face, more from emotional pain than physical. I’ve always been a tough guy and don’t mind a little pain, but the thought of dying like this had broken my … no! I refuse to let my spirit be broken. I wipe my tears. If this is the end then I’ll go with my chin held high.
I hear branches breaking behind some bushes. I’m too weak to get excited. I stare at the bushes with low expectations. It looks like a brown fur coat. It’s big and walking on all fours. It’s a grizzly bear and it’s staring right at me. The hair on the back of my neck stands up. My heart rate increases. Butterflies flutter throughout my stomach. Chilling waves of fear engulf my body. My flight or fight instinct demands me to respond. Chin up, I remind myself. The bear stands on its hind legs and roars. I’m too weak to run and it’s too late to play dead. I’m left with only one option.
My stomach growls again. It’s hunger, but not just hunger for food. No, it’s deeper than that. It’s a hunger to succeed, survive, and no matter what the circumstances are, never give up.
I pull out my pocket knife, open it, and roar back at the bear. This is my cave. I roar again. The bear hesitates, paces back and forth, then charges at me. Salvia falls off of its teeth, gums, and lips each time its giant paws impact the white earth. The bear is bigger, stronger, and more ferocious, but I know its anatomy. I know exactly how to take it down. The thought of eating bear meat almost brings a smile to my face. I don’t flinch, shake, or doubt that I can succeed. I just intensely look the bear in the eyes, twist the tread of my boots into the earth, and stand tall.
The bear roars again as it picks up speed. My knife is my only hope for survival. I squeeze it tighter. At close range I realize just how big the beast actually is. I raise my arms, preparing to strike. My life flashes before my eyes. Bang! Bang! Bang! Its body tumbles to the ground at my feet as more gunshots finish it off. The adrenaline rush fades. I’m dizzy again. I collapsed and passed out.
I dream of heaven, then awaken to the beautiful face and warm grasp of my wife.
The bear hesitated. I survived. I stood tall."

He remembered discussing Jones’ (he’d been Inmate Jones then) home plan with the program manager and a case analyst in the capitol. The inmate had been locked up for over thirty years, and had no permanent address and no job, so his home plan had not been approved. He was still a good worker, but nobody on the street was trying to hire a laborer at his age with stage 2 cancer, so he was still homeless and expected to die in prison.
The following morning, Mr. Smith left his rented cabin at 9:55 (it had been a long drive, and a respectable man was allowed to sleep in when he was on vacation) and headed up the side of the mountain. He was traveling light. If he hurried, he might still have time to reach the top and get back before nightfall. He didn’t make it.
He spent the night in a cave. There were many caves on the mountain. Two were tourist traps. Most were no more than small holes in the ground. According to his guidebooks, three were excellent sites for serious spelunking, but it didn’t give clear directions to any of them. He’d found this one quite by accident after leaving the trail looking for a shortcut. It was warm and dry out and from the entrance he had a fantastic view of the forest, a beautiful valley, and distant hills.
He had missed the signs warning of “falling rocks.” Well, he had seen one that said “No Trespassing - Unstable Terrain,” but that had only piqued his curiosity. So he had only himself to blame when a tremor in the middle of the night started a slide that almost sealed the mouth of the cave. Still he refused to accept that such things happened randomly to virtuous White leaders like him. He brainstormed a long list of people to blame, including cartographers, book publishers, hiking clubs, and even Offender Jones. He tried to contact Lt. O’Neill and tell him to find out how Offender Jones knew about his vacation, but his cell phone repeated “No Signal.”
Mr. Smith dug for a week. He had enlarged the opening to about two square feet when a rock fell on him, breaking his hip and pinning his leg. A few days later, when he woke up and realized that something had eaten most of his big toe, he knew his own home plan had been canceled.
The next week, Warden Roberts sorted through a large pile of mail and checked the missing Commissioner’s emails. Miss Andrews, a red headed young secretary and said (for at least the tenth time) “something terrible must have happened!”
“Don’t worry about him,” Roberts retorted lackadaisically. “Here, forward this to central records.” He signed off on a recommendation for release of some old-timer named Tom Jones. “And tell Mr. Andrews in Programs that we’re going to need a new gardener."

Johnny C, “The Twerk King.” Johnny had beef with Coy, and spilled the beans. Coy knew that I was getting close and bought a ticket to catch the train out of Metro. No time to fill out the 98 Page Form for a vehicle. I had to hoof it.
I ran 15 blocks before I saw Sal “The Sausage Guy.” I was in a hurry so I got a footlong with onions, peppers, coleslaw, relish, cheddar cheese, horseradish sauce, and bacon bits with a soda and a snickerdoodle cookie. Then ran the other 8 blocks to the station. Somehow I forgot to pay Sal (so focused on police business) so he called it in.
I made it to the terminal. It looked deserted except for a lady, leaning up against a column. Some officers had made it to the platform as I looked for any sign of Coy. “JamJack, you’ve gone too far now” said one of the cops. At that moment the train came in sight. Then the lads turned. Dammit, it was Coy with stocking on. That’s why he shaved his legs. “JamJack, we got to take you in,” said a cop. They were big fellas. They grabbed me and I screamed: “Arrest that man dressed as a moderately attractive broad, that’s the goat’s leg messenger.” They laughed. “Sure thing, let’s get you in the car” I screamed “He’s getting away.” They got rough, and put me on the ground. I wrestled with them.
“You’re not fooling anyone Coy with that cheap wig on. Give yourself up,” I said. He just looked at me with indifference. Yet I was still confused. All the heists made sense except for the hardware store. Why the rope? “Dammit Coy, you’ve got a goat’s leg tied around your waist with rope don’t ya? I fought hard against the two cops. Dammit man, arrest that broad, at least look under his dress. There’s a goat’s leg under there,” I screamed. “It’s a dude, it’s the Goat’s Leg Messenger, look under the dress.” They hit me in the head, hard. I blacked out.
I’ve been here at Metro Mental ever since, loaded on pills and jello. Yet burned in my mind is Coy with nice legs and sensible shoes, and a goat’s leg somewhere under that dress.
I’ll get you yet, Coy. I’ll get you yet."

It did no good. The virus spread, more people died.
I worked at Mount Olive Pharmaceutical. We, along with the rest of the world set out to find a vaccine. We were working blind. No one knew where to start. A researcher in Israel hit on looking at an enzyme originally found eating plastic in a landfill. It was genetically modified to instead eat silicon. The molecules it uses to dissolve the silicon was used to make the vaccine. We at MOP ran our own test, we were rushed as everyone was. People were dying in the street, in their homes, and in their cars. Few made it to a hospital, and it was little help. We had to move fast. 13 weeks after the transport broke up, there were 100 million dead. I, along with my lab found that the vaccine did render the blood clear of the virus, but that was in and of itself troubling. We should have seen the dead virus. We did not raise a formal notice of inquiry, but thought it should be studied further. The vaccine was rushed into full production. Our government, as well as the entire world wanted, needed to stop this virus. The vaccine trials were cut short. I still had my doubts.
Friday, 12
I had a hard time getting the supplies to Sanctuary today. I have been packing them in old medical supply boxes and traveling different routes so I don’t have to go through the same checkpoints each time. I have my travel voucher, but even a doctor will raise suspicion if traveling out of the Zone too often.
At first the vaccine was offered as a voluntary participation. The public did not trust that it was safe, so much hype about how it was rushed and trials cut short. I was still running my own test, even though it was in post production for mass distribution. When less than one quarter of the population lined up for the vaccine, the government passed emergency legislation making it mandatory. Chaos ensued. Riots broke out. Marshal law was enacted. All state’s National Guards were federalized and along with active military units, checkpoints were set up in and out of every major city. Everyone that was inoculated was given a government issued travel voucher. Anyone caught outside of their home without this voucher was detained and inoculated. The entire medical field was the first to publicly take the vaccine. I was not convinced that it was safe, so I changed the labeling on the vials for my department. I would not allow myself to be a guinea pig.
Tuesday, 16
When the force immunization was first being talked about I liquidated all my assets. Sold my stocks, house, cashed in my 401k and started buying camping gear. All markets were down, inflation was rampant. I was lucky enough to get 20 cents on the dollar. I bought portable solar rechargeable batteries, freeze dried and dehydrated food, salt, several first aid kits, anything I thought I would need. I already had my guns, but I bought over 2000 rounds each for my handgun and rifle.
I found Sanctuary, a cave, when I was hiking a couple years ago. It had a natural spring, so water was not a problem.
Tuesday, 18
Today is the day I disappear. As I stand here looking out for the last time, I wonder if the years worth of food will be enough for the virus to run its course and die out. I need to lie down, I feel a major migraine coming."

As he walked towards the opening, Cave was determined to stop him. She tilted the rock he stepped on nearly breaking his ankle. Calvin reached for balance and was met with sharp stone. He took another step and slid into a slick pond. He felt his tailbone crash against the unforgiving cave floor. He heard himself grunt as he gathered his thoughts. His wet clothing hung off of him like rotten flesh and Calvin wept at his futility. “I’m not going to make it.” This certainty crept into him like an earwig and feasted on his confidence.
Still the light beckoned.
On he went with bloodied hands and bloodied knees. The dead cold of Cave was on him like a glacier as Calvin slowly pulled away. His steps were rigid and unsure. Every hand hold was not to be trusted. Cave had taken his breath, turned him numb and nearly crippled him. But Calvin began to feel hope.
The opening was near; only meters away and Calvin noticed activity in the air. He squawked as the wall gave away, but remained upright. He had made it and the outside was beautiful. His last step in the cave rested on a boulder and he massaged feeling into his knee.
Somewhere back, deep in Cave, a dislodged rock caused a cave in. But Calvin stood nonplussed and stole the passing wind into himself. It had the scent of atmosphere somewhere miles up in the sky."

We’re going to put an A frame at the cliff top to lower supplies with a block and tackle and a winch. Do it the quick and easy way. We’re planning on putting a solar system up top wired down to the cave. We’ll put the batteries down here and store the panels until needed. That will give us power and lights.
It’s going to be difficult because of the water situation, but we can put rainwater collection basins up top and plumb to the cave. We can haul water from the river and store it here too.

We could also hear the faint groans of the mountain as it shifted under the enormous weight of billions of stone and earth bearing down on the honeycomb coal beneath, and the even fainter echoing, through the stone of the mountain, as charges of high explosive exploded in the far off strip nines or deep nine when we turned our flashlights off and the darkness encompassed us, we could briefly see the faint outline of each other’s aura, and then we were in a complete and total darkness.

As the winter faded I looked to the entrance and the ice wall would be slowly melting. It was very soothing to touch.
The spring was the most intoxicating time of all. There I’d sit at the entrance to the cave. The grass began to grow; lady bugs would fly about. Even purplish flowers would grow and bee’s would come for a visit. Many deer would come by to eat the lush grass. Many would become a meal. The bear would awaken, stretch, yawn and leave, and I’d hope he’d return in the fall. By now my heart has been so lost from love, my skin crawls in the sunlight for it’s my only companion I have.
The summer has come once again. The pine trees held lush green needles. The crows have come, they caw at will as they walk about just outside my home. The winds have come though as I listen to them there’s no feeling of dancing only sleep comes to my eyes so I lay down just inside the darkness.
The sound of crushing leaves together comes in the winds, slowly I open my blue eyes. There’s a dark figure standing in the opening. by the aroma coming to my nose he’s a human. He stands there just looking into the darkness. I wonder if he’s going to be friend or foe.
He yells into the cave, his voice echoes. His soothing voice calls to me though I remain in the darkness. Thunder is heard from afar and he enters my home. He remains standing as my heart quickens; without thought I tackle him to the ground. With a slight struggle, we gaze into each other’s eyes. My teeth sink into his flesh with my fingernails.
One thing is certain as he awakens, I shall no longer look towards the cave’s entrance alone. The cave shall still remain our home and we’ll be werewolves in the night and perhaps love shall follow."

Though, the closer that I got to my goal, the easier it became. Mastering a simple capability that my muscles seemed to have forgotten.
As I got closer to the light, I realized that I was in a cave, walking toward its mouth. I thought, “what am I doing in a cave?,” with this question puzzling me to no end, forcing me to let it go. Especially with a new puzzle presenting itself as I walked out of a cave into the sunlight.
After my eyes adjusted to the newfound illumination that blanketed me, I saw that there were houses scattered in front of me, with some being built. Though, I noticed that there were no people nor animals, anywhere. An area that should have been teeming with life was totally deserted.
Walking through this housing development in search of some clue or someone that could let me know what was going on, and where I was, something suddenly caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. It was a reflection of light that held a possible promise of the answers that I had been seeking.
So, I then maneuvered for a better look at the enticement of my curiosity, discarding the roofed obstacle standing in my way. Behind the house, to my astonishment, I found that there was an enormous wall of gold distantly beckoning me to it.
It was somewhat difficult to make out from where I was, but there seemed to be a pair of eyes upon the wall that became more defined the closer I got. Though, at some point the eyes became a huge cross, or Catholic style crucifix (no, I’m not Catholic) and left me wondering if I just imagined seeing eyes there.
When I finally reached the wall of gold, standing before the crucifix shade in the wall, I looked for a door or gate that would allow me entrance beyond, unable to find one. I then began walking along the wall in search of such a passageway, only to wake up into reality. Needless to say, I awoke slightly disappointed, and  have questioned the dream ever since."
447,"""Cave of my Victimhood"" by Travis Welsh",,No,2020.0,12 - December,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Cave-dfa49b2c259047508266e061339dacb9,Kelly Yu,"March 17, 2021 5:58 PM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_dkAmZMFhkhlfV6CgkkAyuLuku-eeGzFCTahhKehb64/edit,No,"Privately I began to loathe myself. This led to self-destructive behaviors. I could not find clarity, foresight; or will-power. I became a “poster-child” of victimhood, seemingly a fixture within this cave or den of shadows.
Plato presented a similar image in his book The Republic, of people chained in a cave of shadows filled with disconnected echoes. This underground den is not about despair but an allegory of our ignorance of higher thought and the lack of ascension. He calls this place “the fourth perception of shadows.” To my thinking, perception indicates perspective while perspective suggests position and CHOICE.
So maybe I was stuck, by my own choice, in an underground den of a fourth perception. I did not show the motivation to change my position and subsequently this lack of mobility was intrinsic to my poor perspective. I could not perceive that my life had a higher purpose (outside of martyrdoom) or even a worthy legacy.
I am still within the mouth of my cave. The rebel in me sought unchaining and I’m blinking before the sudden brightness, trying to adjust my vision towards a higher perception. I do not pretend to know my destination nor my time-schedule. What I do know is that I have every excuse and right to wallow in an evil state or vindictive nature, but I possess a deep yearn to shed and even avoid the snares of victimhood.
I have glimpses of cognition that my body is a cage and the intrigues of base emotions are an infatuation and sidetrack away from the truest reality. I look forward to exploring this upper-world as it becomes more than mere glimpses. I am one of the lucky ones. Within every horrible experience, I received miracles; strength and endurance as I reached my limits, people suddenly arrived to rescue or sponsor me when dire ends seemed apparent, and forgotten prayers answered. Here I stand, a little good, a bit bad, but nonetheless wiser for the wear and tear. I shall explore the forest of the trees."

His stomach gurgled with hunger pangs, which only served to further motivate his fight to claw his way back to the surface. He was too dazed and weak to move, so he stayed put, sustaining himself on droplets of dew and rainwater, and, when desperate, on occasional rodents and beetles finding itself in the unlucky path of Eduoard. Days turned to nights, minutes to hours. Time ceased all meaning. Whatever mysterious power had zapped his strength paralyzing normal muscular movement. Standing up was a chore in futility, resembling a marionette with Mother Nature his cruel puppeteer.
With effort, muscle control returned. Time to delve into the reality of what happened. So there he stood, cave to his back, scanning an unproductive landscape void of the teeming life it once housed. In utter disdain, he trekked further up the mountain, finally reaching the crest overlooking the valley. Peering into the void, he stared in disbelief, as he collapsed to his knees.

He stopped behind some rocks amid trees on a hill overlooking the town. It was one of his favorite spots as a kid where he pretended he was a Sioux warrior scoping out the town for his impending attack. He had the same feeling now.
The town of Birch, Minnesota had only one main road running through it with no stop lights or stop sign. Follow the road north and you reached Canada in an hour, head south for five hours and you can make it to the Twin Cities. On one side of the highway was a ravine carved out by Loon River that eventually connected with the Mississippi. On the other side of the road was the town Granger was born and raised in.
Birch consisted of a general store/ gas station, a bar, post office and a couple dozen homes on the hill behind the town. It was one of those homes that Granger now made his way towards. It was the same home he had run from the week prior as his wife lay crying and dying.
As Granger moved through the trees closer to the homes he was acutely aware of the stillness. Birch was an empty, desolate shell. The bodies had been taken away and burned and those who hadn’t died and been taken to the military camps to be watered, tested upon, guarded. Granger himself had almost been taken because he’d stayed too long at his wife’s side and when the military grunts in hazmat suits arrived he had to hurt one to get away. He led the search team south down the Loon River Ravine before backtracking and making his way to the cave.
They said the virus had been designed in North Korea and it was effectively killing two thirds of the planet’s population. Some were immune, such as Granger, and the military had a particular interest in them. Granger wasn’t about to become a lab rat and instead became a lone wolf running for his life and hiding in caves.
In his home he stared at the bed where the love of his life had been destroyed by the virus that had no cure. He steeled himself from any feelings, letting only the rage fuel him as he gathered the supplies he needed. He hoped he didn’t have to battle or hide from his own country’s military - shouldn’t they instead be going after those in North Korea responsible for this viral devastation? That was Granger’s plan and he’d do it one day at a time."

“Gatehouse?” she responds. “They’re the biggest company in the U.S., what do they care about a village of Natives?”
I answer, “They didn’t want anyone to find out about the research I was doing in the cave, so they blew it up with mining explosives along with the village. They tried to bury me in the cave, but I found a way out.”
“My God,” she gasped.
“It’s not safe here, we should go,” I tell her.
“You know a place?”
“Yeah, a cantina in town.”
“Sounds good,” she says.
“I’m starving.” I admit, despite being surrounded by bits of human bones and bodies.
After chowing down two plates of beef fajitas and chasing them with two ice cold margaritas, I’m ready to continue. “They took a virus from the bats.”
“Bats?” Crystal asks.
“Yeah,” I go on, “Local villagers near the cave had become ill with a virus that was similar to one found in Myanmar, on the other side of the world. It had pandemic potential, so Gatehouse wanted to get a head start on a vaccine, should an outbreak occur. As an expert on wildlife diseases, they hired me to go study the bats.”
“What did you find out?” she asks, now very interested.
I explain, “We discovered that if a pathogen from the bats spilled over to humans a pandemic was possible, but if kept in an isolated area, the virus could be contained and possibly die out on its own. Likewise, if introduced to a densely populated area, it could spread very easily and quickly get out of control. Gatehouse already has a patent on a vaccine that could be worth billions, maybe trillions, but it’s useless without a virus to treat. I believe they are about to unleash a virus, kill millions, and tried to murder me to cover it up.” A moment of silence ..
“So what can we do?” Crystal asks.
“Not much we can do.” I tell her. “They have the government and media in their pocket, but they’re expecting to have a vaccine delivered, so let’s send ‘em one.” I have invested in an agave plantation just outside town where I kept a small, secret lab for personal research. I had enough Gatehouse materials there to put together a phony vaccine package that looked like it came from their official facility. Only instead of a vaccine derived from bats, I was sending a lethal toxic venom taken from snakes.”
“Think they’ll really fall for it?” Crystal wondered as we sent it out.
“Probably not,” I replied, but never underestimate the arrogance of assholes, especially rich ones.
Two days later … Gatehouse headquarters, San Francisco. William B. Gatehouse owner and CEO of Gatehouse Pharmaceuticals holds a meeting with the heads of Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks: “Greetings and welcome my dear friends and colleagues. As generous investors in the Gatehouse company, I have called you here for a special announcement. We are about to embark on an extremely profitable enterprise and a cleansing of America. Our product will be the #1 seller in the history of medicine, and I’m here to present you with the very first sample, straight from our research facility in Mexico. They were even kind enough to mix it with their finest blue agave tequila - Caduceus Cave - for us all to enjoy. So please raise your glasses as I propose a toast - to health and wealth!”"

Why do “I” get compared to the “whole” ___ when “I” don't believe “them”?
Devante wants to play the piano after a petty argument, instead of an illegal weapon. Studying unstressed and stressed meter while trying to destress his stress out mind and body. Worrying about proper meter, when he could regulate time he have at some musicians meeting.
You won’t hear me complaining about boredom, being broke or no resources or research tools.
Studying writing styles, which is easier than being influenced by time wasting criminals, manipulators- repeat offenders. Prisoner Lives Matter even when you have agitators, sadistic or insane individuals who sow distrust… repeatedly.
Devante may be a “criminal” still, but back in 2009, he had real positive goals.
Prisoner Lives Matter because we all want to live free and love struggling to understand. Just exist as peaceful role-models, parents, family, friends, co-workers- “ex-convicts” in the truest sense.
“What are you going to do when you get shoved back out into new Adulthood?”
I’ll hum at symphonies, browse through libraries, marvel at museums, art, wildlife and festivals. Devante wants to create music, write meaningful text and repair furniture, detail cars, construction- work!
Devante experiences these premonition-like dreams that leaves him yearning for an end to viruses. COVID’s not the only disease I’m referring to like distractions of social media- it’s prison! These death fences are holding me back from memories of seeing my nieces play in their food.
Waking up at 4:35 am to rock my daughter or son back to blissful sleep.
Or come back from the doctor, saying that I may not be able to reproduce.
All worries I’d rather have in a homeless shelter instead of being hidden from society.
Prisoners Lives Matter even if we die of COVID-19 because some of us do (have family).
Do we get to write a “will” for ourselves and give our loved ones memorabilia?
Can Devante request to be cremated so his body won’t be defiled or abused?
Prisoner Lives Matter when we’ve gone years and decades without sporting handcuffs, added time-shame.
We make phone calls to keep our energy Pure, Active, Happy and not feigning hysteria. Some prisoners didn’t manipulate the system of rehabilitation or have ulterior motives- we desire freedom.
There are a percentage of people who don’t care for Prisoners because of horrific stories of their crimes. Or until they’re in our shoes. They forget about those in juvenile, jail or prison, with actual innocence cases, have been framed or just made a mistake, wrong place wrong time- “wrong choice”. I turn my clogged pores nose up at some criminals and their crimes; but all in all; whoever deserves a change to walk out these fences- will walk out alive and go on to live a life worth telling a story about. Successful stories. You always have your mind tweaked with the tragic or sad stories. The ones that give prisoners a bad review. But, it’s the success stories that give me inspiration and a constant changing mindset in how I deal with this prison time.
My children, in the future, want me to pick them up every time they run up to me and raise them high, spinning them in the air and safely touching their little feet to the hardwood floors or plush carpet.
My future children are why Prisoner Lives Matter."

The screams of “Man Down!” (the incarcerated emergency call for medical help) rattle around the various San Quentin housing units.
He also goes on to say, “Even in these times of crisis, it feels that we (the incarcerated) always have to prove our humanity, our rehabilitation and our willingness to make amends.”
But I must say that it has mainly been the incarcerated and our advocates, who have humanized life within California and the nation’s prison system.
Mr. Henderson goes on to say that “we the incarcerated had to fight for our rights”
I have personally witnessed the lives of prisoners matter, the many stories throughout my 17 years incarcerated. Some were heartwarming and tragic. A lot were full of hope, compassion and empathy for those on the outside. My thoughts are on those who didn’t make it in prison, and my hopes are that the next person will make it.
Author and Psychiatrist James Gilligan writes that the self cannot survive without love and the self, starved of love, dies.
In my essay “How I survived Corona Virus in prison”, I talk about various issues on how the prison administration place my life in dangerous situations (airplane crashes, gang violence, corona 19) And I have always felt just as the senator felt CDCR don’t give a damn about PLM. The money comes first anyway, I don’t want CDCR to love me, I do want them to acknowledge my accomplishments, sacrifices and my christin love for them, by letting me out early. (: My life matters because I can now contribute to society and be a productive citizen, work using my skills and education CDCR has taught me. The funny thing is, that CDCR says I’m a violent offender. But I never hurt anyone, wanted to hurt anyone, or will hurt anyone. I am innocent of the crime I’m in prison for (wrongful conviction) so there is no violence in that crime when no one got hurt.
There are many stories we inmates tell our mental health staff about our daily lives inside prison, they are the only ones that will listen to our truths. We talk about our changes and dreams of doing good. I have shared personal stuff with my staff that needs to be shared with the prison administration so that they could understand me better and realize I’m not a threat to society. I know this first hand the two don’t communicate due to certain rules, not even in our annual review does the staff ask about our mental status assessment and progress. Well in conclusion, I know my life matters whether I’m a Black man or a prisoner, I matter to my family, friends, and loved ones and to the many students and volunteers, colleges and various organizations"

It felt awkward. At a loss for what to say, I turned around and fast-walked in the opposite direction. I had no idea Ben was about to commit suicide.



*



Imagine spending the rest of your life locked inside a tiny prison cell the size of a parking space with no hope of ever being released. How long could you endure being trapped in a dungeon while simply waiting to die? That is what it means to serve life-without-parole sentence, condemned to die on America’s slow death row.
There are over 200,000 people serving life sentences in the United States, and despite the declining crime rates, our number is growing. America locks up more people for life than any other country.
“I’m sorry, but if I had a life sentence, I would just kill myself.” Over the years, more people have said this to me than I can recall. I’ve heard it from prison guards and from my fellow inmates. I’ve even heard it from my own family. And every time I hear it, I think of Ben. I remember the decision he made. I lament the fact that I couldn’t stop him from taking his own life. Couldn’t even return his goodbye hug.
It’s 5:45 a.m., and I’m lying on a thin piece of plastic-covered foam that I refuse to call a mattress. My back aches, and my right arm is stiff. Still in my orange prison uniform, I swing my legs over the side of my bunk and place my feet into a pair of tattered, white sneakers. Joints pop as I struggle to stand and stretch. What will ‘life’ throw at me today? I wonder.
I study my reflection in a slab of polished steel bolted to the concrete wall of my cell. Dark circles ring my tired eyes. My hair is thin and graying. I clip my prison ID card to the left collar of my uniform. In the ID photo, my hair doesn’t look so gray. I’m almost dead, I tell myself. My ID card might as well be a toe tag identifying a walking corpse. Killing myself would be redundant.



*



Everyday, I wake up and convince myself not to commit suicide. Not to give into the same hopelessness and despair that crushed Ben’s will to live. To find some meaning in the suffering. To live in a way that is sane. Everyday I wake up to attend my own funeral.
I acknowledge that what I did— the horrible crime I committed 18 years ago— was wrong. If I could go back in time and change what happened, I would. I cannot possibly regret what I did more than I already do. Just thinking about it makes me wish I had never been born.
But no matter how sorry I am, no matter how much guilt or remorse I feel, I remain labeled an irredeemable person. While other inmates can reduce the amount of time they spend in prison by earning time-credits for good behavior, work, and education, there is nothing I can do that could possibly reduce my life sentence. What incentive do I have to obey the prison rules? Why should I continue to pursue my education? I’ll never sit for a job interview or be evaluated by a parole board. My sentence places me beyond redemption.
Not only is life without parole irreducible, it also cannot be extended. If I were to commit additional crimes, no more time could possibly be added to my sentence. Why should I live in accordance with the law? More importantly, why is our criminal justice system turning hundreds of thousands of Americans into an unpunishable class of hopeless convicts with nothing left to lose?
It’s called a “life” sentence, but that’s a misnomer. The truth is, life without parole is death by incarceration. It’s death in slow motion. I am not “doing life”; I am simply going through the motions of being alive. Trying to piece something together from the wreckage of my life. I am lying in a casket, waiting for someone to close the lid.
What is the purpose of a life-without-parole sentence? Does locking people like Ben in prison with no prospect of release accomplish anything besides cruelty at the taxpayers’ expense? What about lifers who are no longer dangerous? Don’t they deserve a second chance? What about the lifers who have “aged out” of criminal behavior and are no longer the same people they were decades earlier? Don’t they deserve even the possibility of parole? These are questions we need to ask ourselves as a society.
Life-without-parole sentences are pointless and cruel. Nobody deserves to be punished to the end of their life. As a democratic society, we should recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all people. Human beings have the capacity for positive change and personal transformation, and if people can change, so, too, can their laws.
It’s time for sentencing laws in America to change. Life-without-parole sentences serve no purpose except sadism and schadenfreude. There should be no place in a civilized society for this level of cruelty. Everyone deserves a second chance, and once an offender has served a reasonable sentence, our laws should afford him or her an opportunity to rejoin society. That’s what Ben would have wanted. It’s what he deserved.
It’s time to end life imprisonment. For more information, visit Endlifeimprisonment.org.

I’m going to keep creating ideas, setting goals, and establishing positive contacts. I have a story to tell that I think will help some people and this is only the beginning of it! I have some ideas for starting charity events to do things for the children in the community. Help unfortunate people find jobs, even creating jobs and other opportunities. I know what it feels like to feel like everyone has given up on me. I also know what it feels like to be blessed with someone who is willing to help when nobody else would give me a chance, and how good it made me feel! Like I got a second wind in a long race. I have more than a few ideas.
I want to do something with my life that matters. Even if it’s nothing more than being a positive role model for my nephew. He’s getting ready to be twelve years old on December First!

I write these words because I want people to understand the pain that incarcerated men and women have to endure, the loneliness, the solitary. I write this because I want someone to understand the definitive fact that Prisoner Lives Matter and that we need to know that our lives matter and that we will be accepted back into our communities. Somewhere upon my daily reflections I’ve come to realize that people need to know that they’re loved and that there’s someone in the world who cares about them, who understands them and who can relate to them in significant ways. Imagine being in prison, without that type of connection, without any real affection, love, or mutual understanding. In a bleak and bereft world like this, life easily becomes a purposeless, lonely and miserable existence. This is one of the reasons why I’m always striving to make more people aware of how important it is to build true, solid relationships between the people on the outs and the people in prison who are continuously going thru these painful struggles. We’ve been placed in prison and separated from our families, separating from meaningful relationships with the only people in the world who cares about us and we’ve been thrown into a warzone of deceit, corruption, negativity and destruction and we are forced to either learn how to swim or sink. We need letters, visits and people to accept our calls or else we’re left with trying to seek this “artificial love” and almost forced into finding this acceptance, belonging and safety in the self-destructive relationships and habits of gang culture and prison life. And thats just one of the reasons why people out there should be more willing to understand that “Prisoner Lives Matter” and that we need people and organizations to get involved in our lives, and in our struggles and to help us make it out to the other side of reality and to help give meaning and purpose to our lives.
To all the incarcerated men, women, and juveniles who are doing time, I want to take this opportunity to let you know that your life does matter and to never give up. As long as you know who you are and as long as you can continue to keep it real with yourself, then you will always be free, no matter where you’re at, or what situation you’re in stay goal oriented, because if you have nothing to strive for, you have nothing to live for, and setting goals and aiming to achieve them gives meaning and brings purpose to your life. You’re going to have haters and naysayers, people who deliberately try to bring you down and there’s gonna be obstacles in your way, don’t let it deter you. Stay determined no matter what. Stay focused no matter what. Its during this period of self-reflection that we should ask ourselves whether we are going to let this situation break us (mentally or emotionally) or make us psychologically. Because the things that break you can also be the things that make you and sometimes we might need to be broken before we can be made whole again.

We were at Rick’s party and must have passed out drunk as usual. That seems to be the norm for me, Todd, and the third man in our crew, Joe. Speaking of Joe - I noticed he was nowhere in sight. Now that was odd because we never left each other without saying something. That was one of our blood brothers rules. “Come together, leave together!” No exceptions! So where was Joe?
I searched the apartment looking in every room. If it had a door I looked inside it. I was almost ready to relinquish my hunt for my friend. When suddenly I noticed a body laid out on the back end of the couch. I saw that the bottom of the shoes said Converse. I knew then that it was Joe. I laughed out loud, gathered my friends together and we left the party.
As we walked sideways to our apartment that was only ten blocks away. I yelled out loud, “one hundred parties down and a million more to go!” Both Todd and Joe repeated those words in a drunken slur.
The week was out, it was Friday, and Todd, Joe, and I were ready to party. We all lived together in a small three bedroom apartment. We had been roommates since our first year of college - over six years ago now. My name is Nate, and Joe, Todd, and I have been buddies since high school.
A few years ago we all dropped out of school for mediocre jobs. Truth be told we were scarcely getting by, and we were all very active alcoholics. But we decided a long time ago that we would ride or die together. Bros for life.
I looked in the mirror and laughed as I combed my hair back and splashed on my cheap dollar store cologne, I stepped out of the bedroom after looking into the mirror for the hundredth time.
Todd and Joe were waiting for me with a plastic cup filled to the top with vodka. We walked out of the door headed for downtown. I thought to myself “we would make it home tonight before passing out drunk.”
Once again I woke up and did not know where I was. It took a few minutes for me to realize that I was at home. I had no idea how I got here. Joe was on the floor stretched out, mouth wide open. Todd was out cold on the love seat. There were beer cans everywhere along with an empty gallon of vodka. I whispered to no one in particular “Another day in the life of the three amigos.” then all went black.
The holidays had come again, my mom invited me and the guys to the house for thanksgiving dinner. We were all very happy because we knew how my family got down during the holidays. Lots of good times, food, and drinking.
We didn’t own a car so when the time came around my mom picked us up at the bus station downtown, and we headed to the family house which was an hour ride from the city.
We were having a great time. The food was awesome. The last thing I remember was playing cards before everything went blank.
I woke up the next evening in my old bedroom to the sound of my mom calling my name from the hallway. “Nate! Nate!”
“Yes.” I said in a low voice.
“Get up and get ready so that I can take you boys back to the city.” An hour and some minutes later we were back in the city where the people never sleep. Man, I love New Orleans.
I decided not to visit my mom for Christmas, mostly because I was still kind of embarrassed about not knowing how things ended the day of Thanksgiving.
A few days before Christmas I received a card in the mail from my mom. Inside was a picture of me and the guys passed out on the couch. I had never seen a picture of us passed out drunk like that. It made me sick to my stomach, it was one of the most pathetic sights I had ever seen.
I knew right then we needed help and it was not going to be easy. But the three of us would endure it the hard way. First step: A.A."

She was silent for a moment, said a prayer in her native tongue, then arose with a slight groan. “This never gets easier, but this, yes, Leah’s boy. Whenever she worked overnights at the 7-Eleven, I, and many others on the block, took turns watching him. You know, the whole it-takes-a-village thing. Leah had a rough go of it, especially with this one, Ricky. He ran away at fifteen, never looking back. Eight months ago, shy of his twenty-third birthday, he phoned, saying he’d found a new way of life and was living with a family - ” Esther gestured around, “When Leah haltingly told me the name - Dawn of Starlight - well, no more words were necessary. As you know from our daily briefings, they feed on the vulnerable, a cult offering a better afterlife amongst the stars, planets, whatever.” She breathed out slowly.
“I’m so sorry,” Leonid reverently said. “Nothing they could do? Legally?”
“No, he was legally aged; they weren’t disruptive, no wild parties, lights out at 10, paid their bills. We weren’t sure how many lived here, I did some digging. They met all occupancy permits, and weren't running a for-profit. They appeared to be model citizens, private, no allegations of abuse, no one younger than twenty-one. Let me tell you, a storied history is behind this building. Built in 1880, it was a gift to the Mayor’s mistress. An open secret in town. His money kept her quiet, but couldn’t keep her from going insane. It’s rumored she hung herself, for all to see, from the outside portico, dressed in nothing but her lover’s distinctive top-coat - a final middle finger to the man she grew to hate.
Couple decades later, oil was discovered nearby, and this was renovated into a luxury hotel. Thirty-two beautiful rooms, stock market crashes, business dries up, and around 1935, this becomes a bordello, where it remained as such through the mid-fifties.
“It stayed in disrepair until the early eighties, when the Dawn of Starlight Ministries,” Esther loved her air quotes for that which she disdained, “Bought the building, renovated and took in the wayward and forlorn. Of course, JonesTown had taken place less than a decade previous, so they were ever mindful of their reputation, managing every aspect carefully, but - “
Transfixed, Leonid simply said, “But what?” The coroner had just placed Ricky in a body bag, the zipping an echo too loud to bear, as they stepped away, approaching the banister heading upstairs.
“Look, I’m Catholic, just putting it out there. I don’t believe in what I’m about to say, but it’s long been said that when the fog rolls in from the Valley, so does the ghost of that one mistress, crying because she cannot find her room or her lover, just floats through the hallways. I don’t know - “
Instinctively, Esther glanced at her Fitbit, morbidly interested in how many steps each investigation took. She shuddered as she noted: six hundred sixty-six steps. She crossed herself, then said, “Come we walk more,” as she drew her gun to take to the third floor.
“Are you all right?”
“I will be as soon as we walk more.”
They had been in the house for several hours; dusk was upon them, as was a light dewy fog, which clung low to the ground outside."

So we walked shoulder to shoulder with African Americans, a march for equality.
We heard Martin Luther King speak, Caesar Chavez spoke many times locally. All of us worked the tomato machines each harvest season. To me, I was blessed to be raised blind to prejudice by my paternal grandmother. She came off the Oklahoma reservations during the “Great Migration West” of the Dust Bowl 30’s. We are light skinned American Indians: ½ of my family is super dark, reddish brown, the rest were tanned white skinned.
The 70’s matured the 60’s into a permanent part of history. 70’s was the glue that put back together a new America from the broken pieces of the 60’s riots.
I could write a book on this subject. But the short story is, we cared deeply for our friends. I think more so than the world is today. We are too quick today, in changing friends, on growing indifferent in this “me first” mentality of the 2000-2020.
Treat your friends like family. Treat your family like the gold they are. Grow closer to each other before life imbritens you.
God bless the 60’s and 70’s. They are what brought America out of the indifference to the blight of others. God bless our nation, but don’t forget your friends of your childhood."

Then, it was Sans-Peppi. I decided I liked Jack. He was a great guy from Lynchberg, Tennessee.
I then did some shots of something that was not an English word, but it sounded exotic. I cannot tell you how many I drank though.
There was some talking by Patrick, Tommy and Michael, but a lot of goners truly. I had the right to remain silent, but did not have the ability. Oh my, what we learned about what I was thinking.
First, I delved into the sexuality of my cousin’s boyfriend, Kim, who was a hottie. I tried to call him and I left a message on his answering machine with my concern of his sexuality.
I then moved on to talk about Tommy’s Aunt Clarie, who I obviously do not like, her being uppity and all. Hate is such a strong word, but maybe it was the right one. I decided that poor women with coarse long legs that I generally do not like. Good thing we were not on the Set O’ Clock News!
I drank and talked, mixed drinks, mixed metaphors all at the same time. I was good and drunk. It was then I felt the need to urinate. So to the bathroom with Tommy, Patrick and Michael we went. I stood up, wobbled, missed the first step, then the second step, so I decided to, yes, you guessed it, crawl to the bathroom , but because my lover and friends are such generous gentlemen, they carried me as far as they could to our bathroom.
I did my business, and we giggled about our inebriated state. The three of us clowning for the camera.
Then, I felt a gurgling coming from my stomach. I am a pretty intelligent guy, so I knelt down and started throwing up. Boy Howdy, did I throw up, but not really in the toilet. I think everything I had eaten since was thrown up. Oh yeah, did I tell you I had never been drunk before?
After our bathroom trip, I decided I was done and went and sat on the couch with Patrick beside me and Tommy on the other end. Michael took the famous photo. Tommy seems to be hanging his head in shame, Patrick with a smirk on his face with his arms around my shoulders.
We stayed home for the party, but… On Saturday I had a hangover that lasted through church on Sunday. I was in a foul mood and watched the video on Saturday night with a Pepsi and popcorn. I apologized to Lori and Kim for my phone message. They laughed at me and said “no problem.”
I am still friendly with Aunt Clarie, but as far as I know, she’s never seen the video, so she doesn't know I dislike her and her uppity ways.
When asked by Tommy and looked at the photos Michael took, I said, “Ah, it was great and so much fun, I don’t see how people do that every weekend.” I then promised Michael and Tommy I would never get drunk again. I have kept that promise for over thirty years. I only occasionally drink a mason jar of Shine."

Girls, alcohol and drugs. I lived in a dorm on the 2nd floor. The school cafeteria had food much better than I ever had at home. It was Paradise.
With extra money from school, I bought a stereo. R got some purple Micro Dot. Henry, R and I went up to my room and took the hits. I got high instantly. It took Henry and R a few minutes. Suddenly, we started laughing and couldn’t stop - After a few minutes, Henry asked why are we laughing? We stopped, best laughing high I ever had. No paranoia was experienced that night - we went to a local club, don’t remember any particulars.
Back in 72, Austin was the most beautiful city I had ever seen. Fields of Bluebonnets would spring up all over the city. Giant oak trees everywhere. I also remember how few fences people had - everybody was friendly, you felt like you were in the country, not a city of 235,000.
One day, we’re driving on S. Congress, we’re at a stoplight in front of St. Edwards. We had just gotten some good weed - we had two joints and a six pack. I light one up - take a couple of hits, very high quality - I turn to pass it to Henry who was driving - and low and behold, two cops in a squad car at the light next to us are looking at me. I put the joint down and I know they saw me - I told Henry who had extended his arm, “Put your arm down and don’t turn around.” Of course, the first thing Henry does is turn around. He says, “Oh shit” - not very loud, but he keeps his composure. I felt like I was in a Cheech and Chong mouse. The cops then make a no-no motion with their index fingers and drive off. Back then, it was just luck of the draw. Some cops would hassle you, some would not. We got lucky.
We went to the first Z-Z top concert in 73. It was at the UT football stadium, open seats. It began about 11:00 or so, when the gates opened - since we were at the front, even the slow movement of the people at the back generated enough force that the pressure was tremendous. Fortunately, it was a very well behaved crowd and they stopped and everything proceeded smoothly.
My girlfriend was chosen as designated driver - she didn’t drink or smoke. Only incident was a group next to us formed a human pyramid - we told them to stop and that they were too wasted. Didn’t listen - girl from the 4th level fell. Taken on a stretcher by an ambulance.
First group was great - we were high. Don’t remember who they were. Next groups were ok. Finally, Santana came on - he was 2nd Billing - unexpected surprise - Jimmy Paige gets on stage - it looked genuine and Santana was surprised - they jammed - electric - incredible guitars.
As the sun started to go down, you could see the stadium enveloped in weed smoke. BIrds started to circle above. Suddenly, a few at a time would begin flailing and start falling straight down then at about 30 or 40 feet, they would start flying again and circle above. They did this for quite a while - very entertaining.
Z-Z top came on. After 20 minutes, we left after having heard Santana and Jimmy Paige, it was very anti-climatic.
Girlfriend couldn’t drive, so I drove. Henry, R, and I would go mushroom hunting. We always respected people’s property. Never left trash or disturbed property.
One day in the fall, mushrooms were sparse. We went further than usual - got dark, we ate some small ones - Henry says someone’s watching - we suggest he’s high - I pick up a stick in case - when we get to the car, a pack of wild-looking dogs run up to the fence. Never saw or heard them - they were good hunters.
On Friday nights, we would drive to Marble Falls - the only place you could set Coors 40 miles away.
I got a job at Stop-N-Go - got held up twice in 3.5 months - Riverside and I-35. I decided to quit - they offered me another location. I rented a mobile home 100 yards from the shore or Lake Traucs - only neighbors were the shack, a cafe or a pier by the lake.
23 miles from Austin, people would come and trip on moonlit nights after a heavy rain - all types of fossils could be found on the shores - no one else for over a mile.
I was truly in Eden - I tried to buy the lot and mobile home. I was stunned at how much they wanted, but the realtor told me about James L. Stewart and the 37.8 acres of the Angermeier Estate. Henry and I became partners because we were the ones contributing the least money. I decided to invest after having an unusual experience at the property (see Appendix A). Got a contract to look at - first 6 names are Vice Presidents of the Bank of Austin - I’m thinking I’m in. It will take a couple of years to make improvements - I joined the AirForce to make the payments and I had to leave Eden. After all, all good things must come to an end. We got swindled - bankers got some of their money back, but we got zero. Stewart got ten years probation. What’s even more depressing is that the property tripled in value in less than three years. We would’ve made a lot of money. When I look back at those times, they were incredible times. The only thing I would change is the alcohol
Appendix A:
I didn’t know much about real estate or contracts, but I knew Austin. I had been in a hiking class where we walked 15 miles on Saturday and again on Sundays all over Austin. After Mr. Stewart took me to the estate, I decided I needed a sign.
On a Friday night, I took two joints, two six-packs and a weak hit of acid. There were two large boulders near the entrance. On one of them, you could climb up and sit on a flat recess. After about 1 AM, less than 20 feet away, 7 deer walked by me; it was a Big Buck - three females and three bambis. At the same time, they all stopped and turned around to look at me. I was smoking a joint in partial moonlight. Just as casually, they turned around and ambled off. To me, it was a sign."

Mad at my dad for not forcing her to go to the hospital sooner. Mad she wasn’t strong enough to come home. Mad that she didn’t think we were worth fighting for. I know it’s irrational thinking. I could pay a hundred-fifty an hour for a stranger to tell me that exact thing. BUt it wouldn’t make a difference. I’d pay it to talk to her again. To be able to ask her why we weren’t enough for her. I guess we all have our questions. I see Justin peering in taxis when they drive by just in case Dad is lying. Billy doesn’t do or say anything. Sometimes I wonder if she took part of Billy with her. He was her favorite. I really wish she’d give him back. I miss her, but I really miss Billy. I don’t like what he’s become.
Loss is like that. You lose someone. You lose parts of yourself. You drop off bits of you in their coffin and when they start to fill up the hole, your parts stay down there. You can’t ever get them back. Grams says that Mom went to Heaven. I try to believe that. I try to imagine she’s up there with a shadowy, flickering angel-like Billy by her side. I can hear them laughing together sometimes in the middle of the night and I’ll get up to find them. Billy sitting on the couch watching an old home movie of Mom. I’ll see his shiny cheeks in the television’s glow, see him tilt the bottle up, and I’ll go back to bed. I’ll cry myself to sleep. I can’t believe she’d take Billy with her and leave his shell behind. She should’ve taken all of him and maybe we could all move on.
Death isn’t really fair. We got to trust in whatever we trust in. God, biology, ghosts, reincarnation. We hope we’ll see the people we love again. We hope they’re somewhere waiting for us. We hope they forgive us for being assholes, forgive us for forgetting them. Forgive us for being so angry that we want to die. Forgive us for blaming them. We hope for God because otherwise all of these feelings are pointless. I hope for God because I need Mom to be somewhere, even in a taxi with the flickering BIlly beside her while she brings him home."

Soon, the neurologist will arrive and give them the bad news: the words they have fervently prayed not to hear: “Your mother is brain dead.”
The moment that brain death occurred, I acquired the ability to leave the body that remains in a persistent vegetative state for now. When the neurologist brings word to my sons, they will be unable to pull the plug, and will defer the decision to their father, who will pass the buck to my parents because he won’t want our sons hating him for the rest of his life for the decision that will ultimately put their mother’s body in the ground. It’s strange how I know these things.
I wonder what my three sons would think if they knew my essence stood before them at this very moment, observing them in their deepest sadness and utter exhaustion. I’m glad they can’t see me though. I’m not quite sure what it might do to their tender psyches.
When all is said and done, I rest assured that I have not raised three kids, but rather raised three well-adjusted adults. In time, they will be alright. They will prevail and prosper. When I get home to my heavenly father, I hope to hear, “Well done, my good and faithful servant.”
Well, the neurologist is at the door. I believe I will return to my body for now because I cannot bear to see these precious sons of mine devastated by grief. I wish the doctor would’ve waited for their father to arrive, but that’s life. I wish God would have waited to call me home so that I could’ve known all my lovely grandchildren, but that’s death.

Recent government studies show that up to 55% of males in state prisons suffer from some form of mental illness, even worse, 20% are diagnosed sociopaths. Therefore, we must be vigilant of the mind games of the predators seeking prey. [Please note, I KNOW most criminals are not sociopaths and rather are normal people whose criminal behavior is part of negative social forces e.g., drug culture, child abuse, domestic violence, and cross-generational poverty.] The book, “The Sociopath Among Us” advises us to watch for key warning signs. For example, the “pity play” is the most universal behavior of unscrupulous people. They attempt to appeal to our sympathy -- they want us to feel sorry for them. They try to come off as needy or pathetic as a manipulation play. Also, watch out for those who only want to talk to you in private or whispers, they may have something to hide. In general, prison experts agree, it is smart to avoid those who fail to conform to social norms (including prison-life norms) e.g., overly aggressive, reckless, impulsive, fail to honor obligations, inconsistent work; constantly changing cells, cellies, jobs, buildings, joints; and lack remorse -- as these are all usually signs of social disorders. So now, the question begs: Well, what can we do to find friends in prison?
There’s no easy answer, but some general guidelines include:


Avoid negative people.


Realize prison has a lot of bad people -- go in with your eyes open.


Go with your gut -- follow your instincts and first impressions.


Be suspect of flattery -- it is a counterfeit charm.


Search out those with common interests.


Don’t pity or become a pity friend.


Do not try to redeem the unredeemable.


Never hang out with anyone that asks you to lie or hide for them.


Be around those you respect and admire -- we are who we surround ourselves with.


Rule of 3: if someone lets you down (lies to you, breaks a promise to you, neglects a responsibility owed to you) 3 times -- cut them out of your life. They are not your friend. Believe someone when they show you who they are.


The reality is, if you live well and healthy, like-minded others will find you. But even that is not foolproof. The truth is, it could take years to really know someone i.e., know if you can trust them. But, in an effort to expedite the process, I have created my own set of “tests” of character to identify those that may be friend worthy.
[Disclaimer: These are not scientifically proven methods. They are simply something that has worked for me in the past. Use at your own peril.]
One easy example, I offer someone I think may be a good person, whom I have been talking to, a “blessing” -- it could be anything from a honey bun to something special from chow. The key is that it has intrinsic value i.e., it’s something others would want. I note their demeanor -- are they thankful or suspicious? Do they accept it or not? If so, do they offer anything in return either at the time or in the future? My offer does not come with any strings, I have learned giving without expecting anything in return is the best way to live in prison, but how someone reacts to an unexpected blessing from another can tell you a lot about someone’s character. Do they at least seem grateful and have the courtesy to thank you? You’d be surprised how many times my generosity has not deemed worthy of a simple word of thanks. You can be sure none of those have become my friends. Another option is to ask your potential friend to borrow something that puts them out a bit (it doesn’t have to be anything you actually even need). A. Are they willing to do you this favor? B. Do they try to gouge you or hold it over you in return? It is these types of situations that are going to tell you about someone’s true nature. Learn to listen and watch for the clues and consider yourself lucky when you discover someone’s true character. Now you know to avoid them and maybe it only cost you a honey bun… you got off cheap. On the flip side, maybe you’ll discover someone with a kind, generous heart and good moral character and again, it might have only cost you a honey bun. What a great return on investment!
Okay, so now you have a couple of friends in prison -- good for you -- it is time to maintain and grow these relationships. How do we do that? Well, firstly, by being a good friend ourselves. And how do we do that? Well, in here, good friendships are rooted in trust and respect -- both of which can only be earned. Try these tips from www.experiencelife.com on how to be trustworthy and respectful:


Be transparent and accountable -- make your intentions known and be very clear about what you want from someone else and what they can expect from you.


Keep confidences -- gossiping diminishes your character to both the person you gossip about and to those you gossip with.


Set and respect boundaries -- when people see you set boundaries for yourself, they respect you.


Be vulnerable. This is a tough one in prison as the predators often confuse kindness and openness with weakness, but if you trust someone, it can help grow and fortify your friendship.


Have discussions -- in person. Address issues calmly, but directly, face-to-face.


Serve others. “Being kind and generous leads you to perceive others more positively and more charitably,” writes University of California psychology professor Sonja Lyubormisky PhD, in “The How of Happiness.”


Show your gratitude. Research has shown that expressing your thanks can strengthen relationships.


Do I practice everything I write here? Do I believe that if I did I would be a better friend and attract better friendships? Whole-heartedly. The truth is, I’m not a “friendly” kind of guy,, not really, I’m friendly, in general, but I am not someone who either likes nor wants a lot of friends. Even before prison, I only had a handful of real friends, but the quality more than made up for the quantity. I am the same in prison. I try to surround myself with a small group of like-minded positive people who I feel I can trust. I’m not perfect. I’ve made my fair share of bad character judgements and have gotten burned accordingly. But, for the most part, I have been fortunate, a combination of luck and strategy. Recently, I was moved to a new building and have since begun to cultivate a few new friendships here. Two of them are guys I have known for years, I have played basketball and soccer with them, seen them at chapel services, and greeted them in passing, but I never thought of them as real friends. Now that we live in the same building and I am able to observe them at close proximity and interact with them on a consistent basis< i noticed they shared many of the qualities I admire in a friend. They are kind, generous, patient, intelligent, humble, and live a positive life with strong moral character. They have passed my tests and I try my best to be a good friend in return. I am confident we are well on our way to building a strong foundation to our friendship. Will we be lifelong friends? Probably not. Inmate life doesn’t work that way (Andy and Red were just a movie). But, that’s okay. Today, here and now, Senegal and Cheddar are my friends… and that is enough. By being friends we are helping each other get through this harder-than-we-could-have-ever-imagined thing called life and, if you really think about it, that’s all we can ever hope to have in our friendships.
Dedicated to all my friends. Thank you for your friendship.
SECOND SUBMISSION:
Convict Chronicles by Leo Cardez
I miss having real friends. Friendships in prison are complicated not only by the physical limitations -- any of us could be moved to another cell, building, or facility at a moment’s notice which can mean never seeing or hearing from someone again. But also, by the lack of trust this place imbues in the soul. God forbid you decide to look up someone’s crime -- sometimes the horrible details are difficult to align with the person you know.
Shankster (real prison nickname, but not the real nickname of the person to whom I am referring) and I were cellies for years and had developed a good, healthy friendship. He was funny and generous and eventually I came to trust him explicitly. But when I had my sister deposit some money into his account as repayment for a painting, she chose to look up his conviction details. It was a heinous story which ended with two grisly deaths including a beheaded child. I could never look at him the same. And yet, I’m sure he would feel the same if he chose to look up my crimes.
Prison has helped me learn the difference between lifelong friendships and “situationships.” There is something about being put into an extreme or new circumstance e.g., prison, military service, college where we are hurled together with others that can feel like they’ve become our chosen family and sometimes they do, but more likely they are just our friends during this important phase of our life. It’s unfortunate but sometimes as we grow, we outgrow or grow apart from even our bestest friends. It has torn my heart out as I’ve mourned the death of so many friendships, both from the world and this human warehouse, than I care to remember. My only solace: I always keep the memories."

“This photo Mr. Carloni, shows lack of judgement, lack of control, and alcoholism, just to name a few things. These are not qualities of a Supreme Court Justice.” The Senator smiled. He thought he had him.
Carloni straightened his tie and leaned towards the microphone. “Senator, that picture was taken when I was eighteen or nineteen years old. I was a young, immature college kid. I assume they had colleges in your day and I don’t know how they did it in your day, but college kids do drink and party, that’s a fact, some pass out.” He smirked again. “Some even throw up on the Dean’s front porch. Wouldn’t you agree, Senator?” Carloni knew that McHosen was his one big hurdle to be elected to the vacant Supreme Court seat. He also believed in doing his homework.
The Senator’s face went as white as a ghost. “Mr… Mr. Carloni, these proceedings are about you and your past, not speculating and avoiding the issues.”
“Exactly, Senator.” McHosen looked confused. “People, especially young people, do things in college, smart things and stupid things from time to time. As in regard to this feeble attempt to discredit me as a Federal Judge and as Candidate to our highest and prestigious court. I say this, was that me passed out in that photo? Yes. Was it a lack of judgement and control on my part? Yes.
However, like MOST people, I matured. Find any other picture or report of me abusing anything, any drug, that you’ll not find. I realized from that night, I really don’t like to drink. I’m not judging YOUR character if you do. I’m now fifty-eight years old. I take my judgeship seriously. I don’t stoop to gutter levels to see things done.
I judge according to the letter of the law. I know we have some tough laws to look at. I assure you, Senator, and any other who may doubt. I will read every word of those laws and amendments before I bring my verdict. I will be but one voice among those other justices. They have to vote on issues as they will. If you have anything else to discredit me, then by all means, let’s waste more of the taxpayers’ money. Taxpayers and their money that elected you and bought that fancy suit you’re wearing and that shiny BMW I saw you pull up in this morning.”
The room was silent. All eyes were on the Senator. He knew that Carloni had one-upped him. If he said more then to the people, Carloni was right and it would come back to haunt him next year in the elections. Ending his questioning was the only “honorable” way out of this. We knew this and by that smirk, so did Carloni.
“I have no further issues at this time.” They voted the following week 17-3 appointing the Honorable Judge Carloni to the Supreme Court."

“I can’t run anymore,” wheezed the man jogging next to me, “I gotta stop.” He’d already given up and was slowing.
“No!” I urged, strangely inspired to be inspirational. “You’ve got more,” I breathed out heavily, “You just gotta dig down and find it.” I lifted my eyes in search of a marker we could strive for.
“The goal post!” I said excitedly, “C’mon, we can make it to the next goal post!”
With a reluctant grunt, the man reengaged his muscles, and we painfully trotted in silence to the mark.
This experience taught me two basic life principles. First, that I have - as all do - the power to influence another. This may seem so obvious it’s not worth stating.
“You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.” - Jane Goodall
Another principle I’ve learned this endurance race called life however, says, “You cannot see things till you know roughly what they are” (C.S. Lewis; Out of the Silent Planet). Much of what we know through vague impressions escapes our ability to apprehend until we can define it.
The second thing I discovered is that all difficult journeys seem hopeless without a goal to set our minds upon; but with such a goal we’re able to endure far more affliction than we previously thought possible. Mankind is notorious for reaching the lofty ambitions upon which he sets his heart.
If in this current leg of your race you find your strength failing, might I suggest lifting the eyes of your soul to scan the horizon for an object after which you can strive? And once you have it, mount up like a fierce tsunami that you may reach. Then find another, till you have crossed the finish line victorious. You may feel spent, but you’re not! There is power in you yet undiscovered; you need only choose to mine the silvery veins of your soul.
Jesus of Nazareth had a tough race to run. It was full of hardship, suffering and grief. The path of His journey ran right through the cross! His strategy for victory? “For the joy set before Him, Christ endured the cross… and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God” (Hebrews 12:2). His race was arduous. To win the prize Jesus set His hope on the joy His victory would accomplish. We too can win, if we follow Him."

But, studies show running can actually reduce inflammation - the major cause of most bone and joint pain - and actually be good for long-term treatment of those types of body pains. In a report published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology researchers at Brigham Young University found that the benefits of running among those suffering from knee or other joint issues likely outweigh any potential disadvantages: especially when it’s done in moderation. Still not enough? Well, now you’re just being stubborn.
Not that we’ve established running is something we should all be adding to our self-care regimen, the question begs: How do I get started? Spoiler alert: There’s really no wrong way to run. Like Nike says, “Just do it.” I like to run by playing soccer or basketball a few times a week. But, let's say you’re not a sports guy or that isn’t an option for you, for whatever reason, that’s okay. Try to master the mile in under 7 minutes. Train by mixing run-jog-sprint. (Pro tip: mix in hill endurance sessions, if possible, by running up and down hills or inclines 10x). I’m not saying running is easy, it’s not. Running can be painful at first, but the day will come when your body begins to adjust - usually around the 3 week mark - and you’ll begin to see the positive results. Maybe you’ll note you’re sleeping better or you don’t get as tired throughout the day as you used to or you’re less stressed or anxious, the benefits are endless. This is also usually the time your body is ready to increase the tempo of your runs or intensity of your regimen, says Runner Magazine.
Lastly, let’s cover your equipment, i.e. running shoes. If you’re lucky enough to be at a facility that sells running shoes, that’s your best bet. If not, focus on the lightest gym shoes with the best sole flexibility. Try to only use your running shoes for actual running, to keep them in top condition. Generally, they should run ½ size larger than your normal shoe size to give your feet room to shift without jamming your toes. Wash them after every 10 uses by removing the insoles and spot cleaning the outside with warm water, soap, and an old toothbrush. Let air dry - avoid the dryer as it can ruin your shoes. Replace them every 400 miles or when you notice obvious wear and tear in the soles or start to feel foot or shin pain.
I hope you come away with some good insights and are ready to go run with them (pun intended).

I informed her that I had something to get off my chest. I broke down in tears to the point of sobbing. She started asking me questions and when she finally got to gay I looked up and said “yeah.”
The first thing she said was “Your brother I could see, but you, no.” We started laughing. A weight had been lifted and running from my true self stopped. (Full disclosure, my brother told our mom in a mother’s day card.)
I realize 100% that the courage it takes to stop running and hiding in the closet isn’t easy and not everyone has the support I do, but to those that’s okay. When the time is right you will know. Don’t pressure yourself. Feeling safe is the #1 priority.
To the haters: because I’m gay doesn’t mean that living in the same cell will somehow make you gay by catching my cooties. This is 2020 and we’re adults. Stop letting others dictate who your friends are. That person could end up being your best friend. We’re people too."

We got our cue, we looked at each other and my sister just froze. I told her we can’t back down now. So I took a deep breath and told her “I’ll try to go and if I fall I will get up and keep trying.” I was thinking that we were going to be disqualified.

Or tie for first, or if not that, at least take second place.
Their parents watched from off the side, each cheering for their son,
And each boy hopes to show his folks that he would be the one.
The whistle blew and off they flew, like chariots of fire,
To win, to be the hero there, was each young boy’s desire.
One boy in particular whose dad was in the crowd, was running
In the lead and thought, “My dad will be so proud.”
But as he sped down the field and crossed a shallow dip,
The little boy who thought he’d win, lost his step and slipped.
Trying hard to catch himself, his arms flew everyplace
And amidst the laughter of the crowd, he fell flat on his face.
As he fell, his hope fell too; he couldn’t win it now.
Humiliated, he just wished to disappear somehow.
But as he fell his dad stood up and showed his anxious face,
Which to the boy so clearly said, “get up and win that race!”
He quickly rose, no damage done, behind a bit that’s all, and ran
With all his mind and might to make up for his fall.
So anxious to restore himself to catch up and win,
His mind went faster than his legs. He slipped and fell again.
He wished that he had quit before with only one disgrace.
“I’m hopeless as a runner now, I shouldn’t try to race.”
But through the laughing crowd he searched for his father’s face
With a steady look that said again, “Get up and win that race!”
So he jumped up to try again, ten yards behind the last.
“If I’m to gain those yards,” he thought, “I’ve got to run real fast!”
Exceeding everything he had, he regained eight, then ten …
But trying hard to catch the lead, he slipped and fell again.
Defeat! He lay there silently. A tear dropped from his eye. There’s
no sense running anymore! Three strikes I’m out! Why try?
“I’ve lost, so what’s the use?” He thought. “I’ll live with my disgrace.”
But then he thought about his dad who soon he’d have to face.
“Get up,” an echo sounded low, “you haven’t lost at all, for all
You were not meant for failure here! Get up and win that race!
So up he rose to run once more, refusing to forfeit, and he
Resolved that win or lose, at least he wouldn’t quit.
So far behind the others now, the most he’d ever been,
Still he gave it all he had and ran like he could win.
Three times he’d fallen stumbling, three times he rose again.
Too far behind to hope to win, he still ran to the end.
They cheered another boy who crossed the line and won first place,
Head high and proud and happy - no failing no disgrace.
But when the fallen youngster crossed the line, in last place,
The crowd gave him a greater cheer for finishing the race.
And even though he came in last with head bowed low, unproud,
You would have thought he’d won the race to listen to the crowd.
And to his dad he sadly said, “I didn’t do so well.”
“To me, you won,” his father said. “You rose each time you fell.”
And now when things seem dark and bleak and difficult to face,
The memory of that little boy helps me in my own race.
For all of life is like that race, with ups and downs and all.
And all you have to do is win is rise each time you fall.
And when depression and despair shout loudly in my face,
Another voice within me says, “Get up and win that race!”"

Every year we have a theme. The last one was rather bacchanalian. The prep required assistance from inmates who run different departments. Generally in prisons everywhere, the inmates do the work, while the staff sit around. Our dorm’s girls go everywhere. Thus they got busy appropriating two water kegs from the Ground Department, two large cans of tuna, chopped tomatoes and cucumber from the kitchen, and a set of mini-speakers from an undisclosed staff location.
The day of the party was feverish. The chefs were busy cooking multiple bags of ramen noodles for the pasta salad, slicing apples and bananas for the pudding parfaits, and organizing the ice for the cherry soda punch. No need to stress about costume materials. The Laundry Department had issued us everything we needed in compliance with the administrative code. The origami artist made our crowns of leaves. The sun went down and the count was clear. The officers were safely marooned … Let the toga party begin!
Okay, I’ll admit, we probably did freak the fresh young officer out. By the time she took her nose out of her trashy urban novel, we had already chewed through the dinner and were hyped up on sugary desserts, candy, and cherry ginger ale punch. Our Tape the Tail on the Officer Game was still on the wall and we had finished the game of Pass the Orange with your Chin.
I suppose we shouldn’t have climbed on the benches and table in the day room and started dancing to Ebony’s endless party playlist. I mean the speakers couldn’t have been that loud. Officier Naif must have glanced at the cameras on wing one and noticed no one was there, not even the coven of old canasta playing biddies. Now, I am not saying the grannies were forcibly carried off to wind two and wrapped in matronly togas. It is a fact that no one made them do the Mashed Potato Linedance on the second tier, it was of their own volition. But that also may have drawn the notice of Officier Naif.
After all, a toga party is not something one would expect to see on a prison security camera. Naif couldn’t decide what to do. Hitting the panic button didn’t seem appropriate. Finally she called the yard Sargent. She told him there was a party going on down here, a celebration to last throughout the year.
Exciting news for Sgt. Bullneck! Then, Naif told him we weren’t wearing clothes which caused him to gallop down the compound. Bullneck is a relief officer from the men’s prison across the street. Probably men in togas are not as exciting a prospect as women in togas. He did seem a bit crestfallen to discover we were not naked but wearing shorts and t-shirts or at least all the appropriate panties and bras under the sheets. Then he pulled the plug to the speakers and ordered in a pleading voice “ladies please, please put your class A on and sweep up all this confetti!”
What can be said? It’s Camp Prisoney Land and quite frankly, we run this."

One day while I was jogging in Irving, TX, a small mutt came from across the street charging me. He had dug a small opening underneath a well made wooden fence. He was barking as he charged. I had several experiences with dogs and know the proper procedure for defending against dog attacks. I knew against this small mutt I didn’t need any technique. I simply stopped, yelled at him and chased him back into his yard through the opening. So I went back to running (really jogging). After a few seconds, I heard something. It was the dog, but he wasn’t barking - I turn just in time to see him turn his head, open his mouth and bite me on the calf. It was a quick bite, and his mouth was too small, and he didn’t have time to clamp down on me. I’m sure he also knew that I would seriously hurt him. It was a small bite, but drew blood. So I chased him back to his yard and knocked on the door. The man was very apologetic and I told him I wouldn’t make an issue of it, but I wanted to verify that the dog had his shots. Then his wife came, and she quickly antagonized me and for a moment I considered making it an issue, but the man told her to shut up and apologize so I did not pursue it. Animal control contacted me later and said the dog was properly vaccinated.
I moved to the far west side of Arlintgton, TX, where the road was one lane each direction, even though it was a major street. So for a few blocks it was almost a countrified setting. I enjoyed running at that location. It was Sunday morning and very little traffic. I had on occasions noticed a rottweiler on this man’s porch. I only saw the dog on a few occasions. It seemed to be very calm and well behaved whenever people would walk by. There was a church nearby, so at times groups of people would walk by where the dog lived. It never seemed to pay any attention. As I was jogging ( I hadn’t seen the dog) I heard something breathing. Just as I looked back I saw it lunging at my calf. I kicked my legs up and it barely missed it. I didn’t have time to turn around since I had to keep kicking my leg up and forward as he alternated legs to bite. I was running in a circle and my glasses flew off. I was now in the middle of the street. I don’t remember how many circles I made, but suddenly I heard a young guy in a yellow Volkswagen who had stopped his car in the middle of the street, and another person had stopped behind him and they were both yelling at the dog. It finally looked up at them. As soon as he looked up I swung my fist across his jaw. I hit him perfectly with full force. He took off yelping. Never saw him again. I thanked the people.
Running begins in the brain. It is estimated that the brain uses 20% of the body's energy mass. Once you have lived long enough you can run back and forth through the pages of your history. I ran so slow I could not catch up with my past. As a very young boy, I searched for the truth. But the cacophony of lies muddled my senses. At age 29, like Buddha, I turned my back on society. Unlike Buddha, I became a functioning alcoholic. It took me 27 years to realize I had met the truth. The truth lies in the eyes of a child. This is the 21st century. There is nowhere left to go. It is a global existence. The barriers which separate us must begin to be taken down. There is no lie which cannot be exposed. It is not an easy task and those in power have no desire to change. It may take many generations  to undo the Gordian Knot of modern societies, but it must be done in order for us to survive. We must teach our children about compassion and love. The quest for truth requires eternal vigilance. This essay is too short for me to detail concrete specifics which I would propose could help us move forward."

I learned to speak fluent sarcasm, and I walled people off with a snide remark or backhanded comment. Oh, I’d often couch my sarcasm in humor to soften the blow, but I didn’t mind cutting someone off at the knees when I felt it was needed. The mental gymnastics kept me on my toes. It also kept people from getting too close.
Nearly a dozen years in prison now, I’ve discovered that it helps to have people in your life who truly care about you. That requires treating people with respect and dignity. It also means leaning into conflict as a way of saying, “You are worth the fight.” Prison has humbled me enough to be okay with being wrong sometimes and to be gracious when I am right. It’s also helped me to realize what is worth fighting for in the first place and to not sweat the small stuff.
Today, I know that confronting conflict can be healing. Avoiding conflict says, “You’re not worth it.” Addressing conflict in healthy ways affirms the other’s value. It says that their story, their experience, and their opinions matter. As Stephen Covey famously said, “seek first to understand, then to be understood.” Others first may not work in a race, but it’s a darn good policy for relationships.
These life lessons haven’t driven me to run towards conflict. I’m not crazy, after all. But they have conditioned me to handle the stress of conflict better, to value relationships more, and to live my life with more confidence and humility. Winning is not everything, but running well … that’s what really counts in the end."

I don’t know what my mom was doing at the time, but I walked out and began my first journey out into the world alone. Soon, I was walking along Kanawha Turnpike, which is a narrow two-lane road with a 45 mph speed limit.
Since it was the fall of the year, many sights begged to be explored in the naked woods on the opposite side of the highway, but I didn’t slow to watch the playful squirrels as they scampered tree to tree while gathering their winter meals, and didn’t stop to ring the bell in the Methodist Church’s towering steeple.
At Chestnut Street, I turned right and continued my grandma-chasing journey until I came to the railroad crossing where a slow freight train delayed my progress for the longest time. As soon as the train rumbled past, I crossed the four sets of tracks and continued on my merry way - until I reached the Spring Hill Bakery.
No boy can pass up the sweet aroma of hot, fresh donuts and cakes and pies and cinnamon. I stopped and stared hungrily at those big glass windows at the display cases filled with mouth-watering treats: donuts of every shape, size, color, and flavor known to little boys; cream horns, cinnamon rolls, cherry pies, birthday cakes, chocolate cakes, and more. My blue eyes were bigger than my stomach, and my pockets empty. If only grandma was here, I thought, I would have one of those delicious cream horns.
Saddened by my lack of a tasty pastry, I continued my journey. I ran into trouble; however, the moment I crossed Kentucky Street and strolled right past the school crossing officer, who thought I belonged in school.
“Hey,” she called to me, “where are you going?”
“To Ma’s house.”
“Aren’t you supposed to be in school?”
“No, ma’am.”
I could tell she had reservations about a little boy running around by himself. She buttoned up my coat while questioning me, but ultimately allowed me to continue on my misguided journey.
I walked to MacCorkle Avenue - better known as U.S. Route 60 - where I had to cross four lanes of traffic on South Charleston’s main thoroughfare. Barely able to reach the crosswalk button, I pressed it and waited for the speeding traffic to come to a halt. I’m sure some of the drivers were mortified to see a four year old cross the highway alone, but no one voiced any concerns.
I was now two-thirds of the 25 blocks to Ma’s. I picked up my pace because the air was biting cold when semis blew past at 55 mph. Ten minutes later I walked into Ma’s house and horrified everyone.
In hindsight, I risked my life just to be with grandma, but I’d do it all over again for just one more of grandma’s loving hugs. I love you and miss you Grandma. I can’t wait to see your open arms in Heaven, and you know I’ll be running."

That ain’t what Devante wanted!
Time to grow up. I was running the wheel of my vibrations in all different directions.
Figuring out the source of my anger, non chalantness, boldness, aggression, narcissism, sarcasm, cleverness, creativity, deep thinking, etc. Finding out who “I AM” and my True Self. Always running from the normal, content, held by tradition, by way of systemic conditionings inertia-like style.
I ended up having to relearn what I already knew unconsciously. Selfishness would be a major one.
A rap by Juvenile; “Acting like a (explicative) who ain’t never had (explicative).” Or; “He ain’t never had nothing in life; so he selfish with what he got now!”
In some aspects, that’s my bad habit. I never had anything growing up; so I perceived. Some people assume I grew up with money or the “good life;” which is not true.
I moved around a lot. Was homeless 2 or 3 times before; living in a hotel with my mom I was good at making it seem like I had things growing up; I was no better than Pinocchio stealing Jerry’s place in running from Tom all the time. Like a hamster on a wheel watchin track and field.
I’m nonchalant with my sharing; if I got it and it’s not my last, it’s yours. If you play games, etc “Ya beat.” I’m suffering too and you are trying to manipulate me! Not happening. Anger rises like treadmill hills and I’m either going to be running and be selfless, tackle that incline and “you can win that failure of a mind game.” I ain’t gonna beg. I’ll suffer; jumping over hurdles. Assumptions are detrimental to some people, no qualified relay race. Devante can suffer with and without. I am so stubborn.
I wish I’d grown up like some cultures that relied on innovation and things in the wild. Since my ancestors were stolen from chasing around antelope, amongst lions, now we are forced to run around on structured land.
I run from tradition and this forged culture because it’s not mine; I was chased away from my roots. I’m untraditional with normal things because I don’t want to be hurt, abandoned or abused.
I don’t have many family stories, memories, traditions, or even role models or heroes to tell stories about. I barely conversate about the past; I’m still running from my past negativity.
My memories circle around things I had no business doing as a kid and pain; like hyenas around a full grown elephant.
There’s nothing to “gloat” or “brag” about. I survived a dangerous day; like a cheetah finding food. Hard to remember the good times. Too much weed.
I ran from common sense sometimes. I’m running from diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. I run and fight hard for this new discipline and tolerance called Life. I’m running small miles to be ready for the marathons."

I gave up on the young marines and Karate. Years later, I would give up on running track for my high school team juxtaposition with basketball. My straight A’s turned into I didn’t give a ‘F’ about five school classes. My sister Chanel in my adopted family began running with the top grades in the house. I just started: running into getting high off weed, chasing enemies (and running from a group that I was beefing with, running from cops, then running away from home, which led me to running with bad friends that influenced me to run into crime, like robbing and selling drugs). One day, my friend called me and said the U.S. marshals came to his house looking for me - that’s when I officially was on the run! I eventually got caught for the crimes I did and ended up with 9 to 20 years at the age 16.
Early in my bid, I ran into problems. About ten fights total in a seven year span. Those fights could have been avoided, but I lacked wisdom and maturity. I was running with a street mentality instead of spiritual guidance. I haven’t been in a fight since I was 25 years old.
Two years later, I’m up for parole. Now I realize how fast I ran out of time with nothing accomplished. No trade, no religious book written telling how I changed my life and found God, and no money saved up for an apartment. I got a one year hit (prolonged stay in prison) and still haven’t completed my goals. The flu and COVID-19 almost killed me January 2929 with the preexisting conditions I got which are undiagnosed so far, due to poor jail medical doctors. That life threatening virus reminds me how my immune system is getting weak (signs of aging). I canned the truck yesterday and came back to my cell with pain in my knees - signs of aging. My hairline is running backwards - signs of aging. All these signs of aging means I’m running out of time of being on this Earth. My ten years in prison felt like only four and a half years of memory. The other five and a half feel like a blur, vague, and incomplete or nonexistent.
After I complete my religious book and money savings for an apartment in prison, going home and having kids, teaching them about Islam and asking them to pray for me when I’m dead is my third must-do goal. Doing good deeds to outweigh my bad deeds is my final goal. That can be accomplished in two years, but it’s uncertain because I could die from so many things like a car accident or some enemy of mine seeks revenge on me. If I do achieve my third and fourth goal, then steps to the grave is what my life will feel like. My life will feel like an old man retiring, cruising to his last destination in life (heaven). My four goals should only take five years max to complete. Five years compared to the life expectancy of 75 years old for an American male, that’s about 43 years after age 32 to expect to die of the unknown. My time expires after my goals expire because I’ll be running out of time, chasing God’s mercy to get into Paradise."

I’ve actually made quite a few bad ones that created many irreversible problems. This is why I’ve focused so much on improving the way I solve them. Now I’m quite good at it.
Since negative emotions cloud our better judgement, I suppress them by focusing on understanding the cause of the problem rather than letting my emotions escalate it. This redirection of focus, with repetition, is the key to transforming negative emotions and impulses into positive ones. After weighing out the pros and cons, I choose the solution that minimizes the consequences to everyone and everything in existence.
Sometimes I already know the best solution because I spend a lot of my free time mentally creating problematic scenarios, relevant to my life, then solving them in my head. This method is the key to making good split-second decisions. If only I knew, then, what I know now…
I’m currently at Florida State Prison, on maximum management, with the most dangerous inmates in Florida because my past keeps overshadowing my existence. I’m confined to a one man cell and only allowed to have paper, pen, stamps, and envelopes. I’ll be stuck here for at least a year.
There are three solutions to my life’s biggest problem. One goes against my morals and values. Another goes against my natural human instinct to survive. The last option is to run. This is the only problem I run from. But what happens when there’s no room to run?
Somewhere out there, one of you is contemplating on joining a gang. Learn from my mistakes, don’t do it. One day, your morals and values will change and you’ll be left with three options: defend your life, be killed, or run. Every time I’m forced to deal with this problem, my life gets harder and I’m tattooed with new physical and emotional scars.
In this game of life, sometimes we get stuck with a bad hand. Instead of letting it discourage us, we should use it as motivation to rise up, beat the odds, and reach our full potential. It starts by developing a righteous mind through constant observation of our thoughts, then redirecting our negative ones into positive ones. Positive thoughts produce the positive emotions that keep our minds clear, allowing good decisions to replace bad ones resulting in positive actions. It’s an endless process of trial and error that’s never perfected, but gets finely tuned through repetition. The key to its success is consistent effort.
Everyone seems to be holding better cards than mine in this game of life, but because of my selfless, righteous, and positive mentality, I’m still in the game and I’m positioned to win."

I wasn’t physically, sexually, or even verbally abused at home. Mama was a quiet, responsible, hardworking single parent, undeserving of the grief I gave her. Did all she could to raise me right. And I took her car that day out of boredom.
Initially, I was just gonna go see my girlfriend, Linda Kay, face the music later. Not knowing Waco’s streets well enough, I got lost. As the sun set with my hopes at finding Kay’s house, I changed my plan to go back home. My new plan included driving 30 miles south to my hometown (where it’s impossible to get lost), picking up friends and getting deadface drunk. The rest was unplanned.
A week later, I was in jail, separated from Mama’s car by over 50 miles after its engine died on Highway 6, where we left it before hitchhiking to Waxahachie to visit a friend’s mom.
To start my new life as a runaway, I went into a clothing store with a group of boosters and got caught trying to steal a pair of Docker’s slacks. The store owner actually chased me around the parking lot in his Honda Accord. I out ran him, caught up with my crew, blocks away. “You slow,” one of ‘em chided. Suddenly, red and blue lights flashed with a siren blast, and my accomplices scattered into alleys/backyards/manholes somewhere. They knew the area. I was arrested.
After being bailed out hours later, my uncle drove and yelled, while in the backseat, Mama grabbed my collar and punched my eye one good time. A tear didn’t fall until my uncle warned, “You best not hit her back either!” Broken, I sobbed, “I can’t believe you think I’d hit my own Mama.”
“You stole her car!” he pointed out.
“I didn’t steal it,” I explained, wiping my face. “I just borrowed it.” Mama actually chuckled at that, shaking her head. With a barely concealed smirk, Uncle Gene concluded, “That ain’t funny, boy.”
I was 18 when I decided to leave my hometown for Dallas one night. I was bored with small town life again. Mama didn’t think that was a good idea. That I was moving too fast for my budget and experience which was close to zero on both counts.
In less than a year in the city, I found myself hiding out in a dark motel, wanted for murder. I spent five teenage years running from boredom right into a life sentence.
I should’ve just finished the dishes."

I jumped it and waited for Don to come over. He didn’t, so I jumped back over. This is where he claims I found superhuman strength to throw him over the six foot privacy fence. After I made it back over, we were able to walk to my uncle’s house. We got away with a small amount of running.
The next story picks up in a high speed car chase on Westbound Interstate 94 Freeway. This time, I was in the passenger seat, and Don was driving. At this time, I was the more experienced driver, so I was barking out directions. We came up behind a semi-truck, “hit the left lane and pass it, then make the exit on the right.” That was a maneuver out of the movies; surprisingly, Don was able to make it. Coming up the exit, we were doing about 80 mph, I told him, “you know you’re not going to make this turn.”
As the car burned rubber trying to stop, the pole kept coming closer. Next thing I remember is the car full of airbag dust. I jumped out and told Don to follow me. After about 40 yards, I looked back to see Don running down the hill leading to the freeway. I watched in fear as he dodged car after car, until he ran up the hill on the other side of the freeway.
From that point, I didn’t see him while I ran for the next hour. Everytime I would stop, I would see another police car. But I made it home, I climbed in the basement window. After I cleaned myself up, I sat down in front of the TV.
My room was in the basement, the one window that worked was my room. After maybe an hour, there was a knock on the window. I jumped up and opened it. To my relief, it was Don. That time it took a lot of running, but we made it.
The last story finds us in the parking lot of a K-Mart. This time, it’s three of us: John, Don and myself. The stolen car we drove there now won’t start. So JOhn is under the hood, Don and I are standing at the driver and passenger doors. Unbeknownst to us, an officer had pulled into the same lot.
We never noticed him as he walked up and asked if we were having car trouble. He was standing in between John and Don. His next question was, “Whose car is this?” John pointed to me and took off running, I understood why. He was already on the run from juvenile detention. But the officer didn’t give chase, he pulled out his pistol and pointed it at Don. He told him, “don’t even think about it,” Seeing this, I knew Don had zero chance of getting away. So I didn’t run, we went to jail together. And John came 30 minutes later.
My decision not to run, shows how I view “running.” It’s more about loyalty, sticking it out no matter the situation. Though I’m serving a LIFE sentence, I can proudly say we are still “running” together still."

You don’t call my people from India brown people. I said my people because 7% Indian from India, that’s me. I took the test from 23andme. It took the National Football League how long to recognize the error of their ways. Whose idea was it anyway to call humans a RACE, a RACE?, a RACE?
We have the ability to use drones to do surgery, identified Planck’s constant, and a discontinuous transition of an electron, and utilized game theory to enhance our net worth.

It was 1970, and I fell in love with Florida. It was so laid back compared to Long Island. Everything in New York is fast. Especially driving! We don’t fool around. I was very popular in high school. I dated but never kissed a boy. I got pregnant at twenty and had a son at twenty-one. I was not married but kept my child. He will be forty-seven this December and I will be sixty-eight.
I loved being a mom and took great pride in it. My children always came first. Mark lives in Colorado and his brother Brad is an investment banker on Wall St. Both my sons were popular in high school. Mark was the school’s quarterback and boy, could he play! Colleges were scouting him during senior year when he tore his ACL in his knee. It destroyed his prospects. Brad is nineteen years younger and was a scholastic genius, especially in math. He excels in his career. There are no grandchildren yet. I’m depending on Brad. He is so handsome and will make beautiful babies, but I don’t even know if he is married. It breaks my heart that I lost all contact with my family.
After raising my first son alone, I met my future husband, who was nineteen to my twenty-eight. He was so handsome. I put him through college and law school. We stayed together twenty-four years. We had an exceptional life living in a two million dollar home in Pasadena Yacht and Country Club. We had a three story home with an elevator, gourmet kitchen, library, pebble tech pool, jacuzzi, and a dock for the boat.
Our neighbors were professional ball players from the Buccaneers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Yankees, and Red Sox. My husband was in his glory! Our home was built to spec. There were hardwood floors inlaid with Italian marble and granite throughout. There was a floor to ceiling fireplace. This house had all the bells and whistles! It could have been in Architectural Digest. Yes, it was that magnificent.
I went through a terrible divorce in that house and I had to sell it. Then, my husband kidnapped my eleven year old son. I had a nervous breakdown. The doctor put me on Adderall to kick start me, but it backfired. I got down to eighty-seven pounds. I went into an amphetamine induced psychosis and committed my crime. Thank God my victim is alive.
I have a natural life sentence, which isn’t fair. Now, my attorney ex-husband got the judge to give me life, so he doesn’t have to pay me $4,900 a month in lifetime alimony. He had it stopped when I came to prison. Now I am indigent and it is very hard on me not having money to live on in prison. Prison has been hard on me physically and emotionally. It’s a very hard life.
Looking back, I never should have divorced my attorney husband. My life spiralled out of control. He was cruel to hide my son for fifteen months. I should never have taken the Adderall. I miss my sons so much. I will be sixty-eight December 1st. I don’t want to die in prison. I ruined my life. I will never take anything for granted. I do my clemency this year. My dream is to run for the gates of freedom."

Determined to make a change now running for office climbing the political ladder with a soaped up rope,
Dry bones dancing from the depths trigger running from the past like someone groped by the Pope,

Rally running with the wind at my back spark questions of who-what-when-where about the race and the pack,
My minds running towards the desired end for a sack - no time to crack when reaching for the rack,
Rules of the metaphysical game - run with the expectation and discipline to win giving no slack,
Introspect reveals running is a tool used by the wise and the fool to move on life’s track,

The screen door and shutters on the right ground floor window were leaning against a column of the rolling roofed porch which wrapped around to the side.
“There’s a little work to be done. Being the man of the house I’ll need your help. What do you think?”
“It’s perfect,” he said. The grass was almost the same height as the fenced in grassland between them and Big Shine Lake. “Can we go inside?” His eyes were gleaming with excitement.
Jennifer grabbed two sets of keys out of her stonewashed jeans. She handed Alan one set. Once the keys hit his hand he sprinted towards the exhausted house laughing. Jennifer wiped her tears and followed her son.
Alan’s dad was killed in a logging accident when he was younger. His mom couldn’t afford a lawyer so the settlement they got barely covered the funeral costs and tied them over till she could get a job. She swore to Alan one day they’d have a place of their own.
Alan had to shove hard to get the creaky door open and stood frozen. The living room was bare, just a stain filled greenish carpet greeted him. On his right was a wooden set of stairs that led to the second floor. The far back wall was an opening into the kitchen.
Jennifer stood behind her son. They had yet to enter. “Well? What do you think? I know it needs work, but we can make it our own over time.” Alan was still silent. Jennifer looked down at her son.
“It’s beautiful mama,” was all he said then entered the house. The floor creaked a little under the carpet. Jennifer followed Alan into the bare kitchen. The cabinets were a dirty lime green, lighter where the appliances once stood. The floor had worn to a yellowish white linoleum with a crack where a table had been. Through the dirty windows were some ancient looking oak trees.
“That’s where I’ll build the coolest treehouse.” Jennifer smiled.
“Yes Buddy, you will. Do you want to go check out the bedrooms?” Alan spun around and sprinted for the stairs. She turned and followed at a more human pace.
At the top of the stairs, squished between two small bedrooms, was a small bathroom with a bathtub, single vanity, and a sickly looking toilet.
“Mama, I want this room.” Jennifer turned towards her son's voice. The room he chose had a spider webbed cracked plastered walls, a simple closet, and two windows that looked out over the nearby state forest. He turned to her “Have you looked at your room yet?”
“No,” he took her hand and led her out the door across the landing into the other bedroom. Its walls were mostly intact plaster and the wooden floor had a slight buckle along one wall. They stood in silence taking in the view.
Alan turned and hugged his mother. “This is the bestest birthday present ever. I love you mama.” Tears instantly fell from Jennifer’s face.
“I love you buddy, I love you too.” She knew everything was going to be alright."

A more competent doctor removed his cast, cut his arm open, put the bones in place, and sewed his arm up and stabilized it. When the swelling went down, he changed the cast and then discharged my son; but he did not help me to sue the other doctor or to apply for sole custody of my son.
A few years later, Pamela tore Bobby’s ear almost off. A doctor sewed it back on. I assembled a large pile of police reports, medical records, government reports, and other documents and took Bobby to the courthouse to show a judge his scars and apply for domestic violence protection.
Before we could get to a judge, Pamela found us. She snatched Bobby and went into hiding. I tracked her for three years, but she stayed a step ahead of me. She continued to spread vicious gossip about my son as well as about me. Bibby was, if she was to be believed, an escape artist, an acrobat, a liar, a thief, and one of the most devious seven year olds in the world. He tried to please Pamela and her Johns, but it seemed he could never do anything right.
Bobby was indeed becoming rebellious. He knew some of the things Pamela did with strange men. He told grownups that Pamela was mean, and a liar; but that only made things worse.
Doctors prescribed Ritalin. Psychologists subjected him to individual and group therapy. Bobby stopped talking about Pamela and she was finally able to teach him to do one thing. With the help of a growing cocktail of drugs, she trained him to tell increasingly bizarre stories of “recovered memories” of his father but the man he used to live with at home in Burlington.
Finally one day in July 2000, Pamela dressed Bobby up and took him back to Burlington. She made sure he was high enough to be compliant, but still sober enough to walk. She led him into the courthouse. A prosecutor helped him stagger to the witness stand and spin a sordid tale of rape, beatings, threats, sodomy and buggery.
Pamela got sole custody and a steady income from the government. I got a life sentence. For the first time in his life, Bobby got a hug from Pamela.
He had finally done something right."

We slept fitfully. Our dad returned from the hospital at 3:00 AM, and promptly, collected us. I can still remember my sweat soaked pajamas clinging to my skin. Mom survived, and returned to work two months later. Life changed forever.
A year later, our Pop died of a stroke. Medical professionals did all they could, but Mom eventually made the gut wrenching decision to discontinue life support.
Ever since, I’ve viewed society’s rescuers as heroic, dedicated, and honorable. Years later while taking classes at the city college, I befriended a student, Donna, who was in one of my classes. Coincidentally, she was the ER nurse on duty when my mother was there that fateful night. I had been given the opportunity to say “thank you.”
My brother and I were especially close to one aunt, who was a nurse for forty-five years. She served in WWII, and mended the wounded returning from Vietnam. Often sad, many times funny, the stories she related were nothing short of inspiring.
It would be a different type of rescuer, psychologists, who touched my life in 1997, when the airline I worked for exploded after take off, killing fifty-three colleagues. So many of us needed healing.
World-wide, the full display of courageous rescuers was apparent on 9/11, cleaning buildings, extinguishing fires, and saving the injured, often losing their own lives to save others.
Down the road, addiction gnawed into my life. Again, the frontline workers played pivotal roles in my self destructive behaviors. Some of those hospital visits I don’t remember, others I wished to forget. Even now, serving time in Federal Prison, there is one couple, once strangers to me, now close friends, who write others and myself, showing us we are not forgotten. It came as no surprise that one was a nurse, and both heavily involved in their religious community. This speaks to a different level, and some would say, a more significant form of rescuing.
In a full circle moment, we collectively have arrived at this once-in-a-century event: the Coronavirus Pandemic. If I could be on a balcony right now witnessing shift changes, as seen on the news, I’d applaud until my hands fell off for all the healthcare workers.
Many, myself included, have tested symptomatic positive for COVID, making me even more cognizant that medical personnel day in and day out, risk their lives to take care of us.
My question that I have pondered of late, how do I repay those who have rescued so many? I can go out and live a law abiding life; remain ever grateful for their sacrifices; and quite simply, don my mask out of respect for those who have dutifully rescued."

Hillbilly got a pair of needle nose pliers which had a built in cutter on the side. As I cut the barb and pulled the remainder through the web of its foot. It did not try to peck me or struggle to get away. I felt relief to know it would be just fine.
The one with the barb had dug a one inch gash into its beak. It sat quietly as I removed it. Hillbilly removed his hat and I did the same. We backed away so the birds could get a little breathing room. It only took a couple of minutes before they flew away.
To our surprise they circled a couple of times in the area we were in. Then they were gone. The lure was given to our boss man and it remained in his desk until well after he retired. If the two had stayed the way they were. surely the two would have perished.
For once I can say the two of us rescued two living birds and do hope they had enjoyed a healthy life. Not only did we feel good about helping out. We knew that they were in good hands that day."

Poverty had been as constant in my life as my father’s absence. My mom battled constantly with low-wage jobs to keep my brother and I fed, but the strain was manifesting itself in ways I’d never noticed when I was younger: drugs, alcohol, various sexual relationships. When she stopped being able to work because of physical disability my sophomore year, I got a part-time job at the McDonald’s on the naval base on the other side of town to try to fill the gap.
One day, I came home to my mom crying and the news that we were being evicted. We were 3 months behind on the rent and had no one to ask for help. My mom started talking about the possibility of homeless shelters and I knew it was real.
I cried and cried as I told Christie how I was probably going to have to drop out to support my family. We hugged each other tightly, trying to squeeze the broken pieces of my life back together. Then something unexpected happened.
Christie’s mom, overhearing my situation, sat me down and gave me an invitation to live with them through my senior year; to have the chance to graduate without the burdens I’d been facing. I didn’t know what to say. These people owed me nothing, and yet, they were fully inviting me into their home - into their family.
That last year of high school was tumultuous in its own way. Unfamiliar home expectations, coupled with my ever prevalent sense of abandoning my mom and the tricky technicality of turning 18 made me about as insufferably rebellious as a teenager could be.
Still, they treated me like one of their own and gave me the support to graduate - without which, I honestly don’t know where I’d be. I still talk to Christie and her family over a decade later, especially her mom - the women who rescued me by letting me into her family."

Giving me hope, motivation, and a safe place emotionally. Without her I would have succumbed to my foolish ambition. Even now after being sentenced to LIFE in prison for over six years, she is still here to protect her baby brother.
Next would be my son’s mother Jazme. Many look for a partner and never find one. In one of my most tumultuous years of life, she was there for me, throughout the year of 2008 we had many highs and lows. But our highlight of the year wasn’t the parties, the dates, or living together.
It was finding out she was pregnant with our son. Before this moment, my life had no purpose. I lived to see 21 years old, when I wasn’t expected to make it to 18. I lived my life day to day with no responsibility for anything or anyone.
With Jazmen deciding to have our child even after I got locked up, gave me purpose. In every sense Jazmen rescued me from the irresponsible lifestyle I was leading. Now everyday is about my son, and how I can help him grow without all the negative experiences. It takes an extraordinary effort to be involved in Roderic Jr’s life, but it’s a step up from my part mundane existence. And I can truly admit that Jazmen’s decision really gave me purpose and saved my life.
Lastly, I have only had two serious relationships where I was fully invested. One was with JAzmen, that saved me life. The second was with JeLois that helped me realize my potential.
We were friends for over 5 years, before we decided to go further into our relationship. Although it only lasted six months, the experience would give me lessons for life. I have always been present and involved with my family, but I never knew the effect I could have on people or how much I actually knew about life.
I never tried to go beyond the below average expectation of a felon. Nothing I do is for myself anymore, I have people that look up to me and value my opinion. Just being there isn’t living, providing, educating, and helping others is doing something. A lot more than I did before, and what I will use to reshape my future.
Which before dating JeLois I never knew, now I can look forward to smashing my way through set standards. I am my own person, and I’m not afraid to step out of my comfort zone in pursuit of what nobody thinks I can achieve. JeLois rescued me from the handcuffs I put on my potential. And though we rarely speak since my incarceration, I will always  be grateful she opened my eyes."

His wife snored next to him oblivious of the noise. He reached under the mattress and got his 9mm glock pistol, then without hesitation, hurried out of bed, hurried to his kitchen and removed a large butcher knife from the silverware drawer. The dog continued to bark, he hurried out of his front door, barefoot and in pajamas, morning breath and had to take a dump, needing his morning cup of coffee. He half walked, half ran to a black SUV parked in front of his neighbor’s home. He stabbed all four of the vehicle's tires and hurried back through his front door, through his home, through the kitchen, and out the back door, hurried to the lawn chair, positioned himself  behind it, aimed at the wall and waited. The dog continued to bark, then whimpered and the barking stopped. The first man came stealthily over the brick wall, then the second man. He squeezed the trigger and reflected on his hours at the gun range, hitting bullseye on paper targets silhouetted by an image of the top half of a man’s body. The men were completely surprised and both were shot multiple times. Both bodies dropped in heaps. Thomas hurried back through his home, out the front door, just as the third man ran from his neighbor’s backyard and jumped in the SUV. Thomas made eye contact with him as he started the SUV and attempted to pull off. Thomas raised his pistol, aimed, squeezed, and the last four rounds in his 15 shot clip smashed the front windshield of the SUV as they slammed into the third man’s cheek, forehead, neck, and left eye. Thomas sat down on his lawn - what a beautiful manicured lawn, what a nice quiet neighborhood. What in the hell had just happened? Would he be awakened again by the neighbor’s door barking? Not this time…
He sat on his lawn, some say he was talking to himself as tears streamed down his face, but he was actually talking to God, thanking him. For the next four hours his quiet street was full of police vehicles, coroner’s vehicles, news vans, a helicopter overhead, detectives, neighbors, friends, family members, curious passersby’s, an animal control behile to remove the true hero, that loud ass dog that had been killed. Thomas had been able to change into a pair of jeans, some loafers, and a white button down shirt. The family attorney had arrived an hour later. The skies were blue, not a cloud in the sky - the weather man had predicted an 80F day. His next door neighbor had been contacted at his job and asked to come home. He had just pulled up, but had to park 2 houses down. Someone had the presence of mind to bring in a couple of KrispyKreme donuts, and Thomas ate one and sipped his coffee. Sledgehammers could be heard literally knocking down Thomas’s bedroom wall. A map was found with the home’s address and 1.4 million dollars was secreted in a wall, it had come from an armored car heist years ago. The thief who had killed his coworker and took off with the money had hid the money here years ago. Before his mother had died, and before he went to prison and before the home was sold to Thomas and his wife ten years ago.
Now, the prisoner was on his deathbed, had stage 4 cancer and knew he would never make it home to spend the money - it was a good chance he wouldn’t make it another week. So he told a young prisoner he had been grooming, passing down the tools of the trade. The prisoner had been released only 2 weeks ago. He was the first to come over the brick wall, he was the one who made eye contact with Thomas in his first dream, vision, premonition or whatever it was that had just absolutely saved his life. Thomas used to get premonitions and see things happen before they happened ever since he was a child. He used to share them with his mom and she called it “crazy talk.” So he stopped sharing his visions but he still had them. His great great grandmother had been burned at the stake in Salem, Massachusetts. They say she was a witch - maybe her powers were passed down to him, who knows? But when the detective asked him how in the hell did he have the presence of mind to get out of bed, flatten the getaway driver’s tires, lie in wait for the men to come over the wall, kill two, run to the SUV, barefoot and pajamas, kill the third man with marksman like skill, he smiled and replied, “sir, in all truth, life is a mystery and I wasn’t trying to be history, I truly don’t know how to explain it sir, so I won’t.” The detective looked at Thomas, saw the sincerity, saw that he was scared shitless, but that is what courage is, being brave in the eye of fear.
Thomas’s mother walked up to him during an unguarded moment and whispered “you had a vision, didn’t you?” He shook his head “yes” and she smiled and said, “that was my great grandmother, she rescued you son, she really did.”"

Christainity provided the Crusades that killed Christains, Muslims, and others. It sold entrance to Heaven by “indulgences.” (Roman Catholicism). Rome’s rebellious daughter churches enabled and supported slavery in America and Jim Crow. This same Christainity exists today; they are today’s Pharisees and Sadducees - rich, powerful, better than others, judgemental, and lost. In the End Times, Satan’s hallmark accomplishment is deceiving the whole world (Rev 12:9). How are 2 billion Christains not part of “the whole world’ when they are the “little flock” in Luke 12.
I studied Islam, Buddhism, Christainity (all forms), Jehovah’s Witnesses, and sexual debauchry. I vowed to “God” that when I found the truth I’d devote myself to it. Basically, “prove you are real and I’ll serve you.”
April, 2010. I discovered Herbert W. Armstrong who interpreted Bible prophecy from 1932 to his death in 1986. Accurately. Very specifically too (not cryptically general). They began to fall in place in 1989 and continue today - worldwide. I looked at his doctrines.
The Way is founded on the Law (Torah), and framed by the Prophets (Acts 24:14). The Laws define what sin is (Romans 7:7-1 John 3:4). The New Covenant is based on the Law (Hebrews 8:8-12; Jeremiah 31:31-34) being written on our heart and in our mind. “Jesus” came to fulfill (pleroo) the Law which fills it up and makes it more strict (Matthew 5:17, 21-28), because we are judged by our love, not just actions. This is confirmed in Romans 13:10, “love is the fulfilling (pleroma - what fills) the Law. The cornerstone is Sabbath: established at creation, given before 10 Commandments (Exodus 16), confirmed for today (Hebrews 4:1 - 10, esp 9) and required by Gentile converts (Acts 15:21). John, the Apostle “Jesus” loved, said “he who does not obey the Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him (1 John 2:4) an dthat to love “God” we shall keep His Commandments that are NOT burdensome (5:3).
In 1981, Armstrong tasked his church’s top leaders to research the Hebrew, personal name of “God.” They found Yahweh. Today, our leaders tell us we cannot know this for certain. A lie. Yahweh predicted that prophets of lies would cause His people to forget His name for Ba’al (Lord) in Jeremiah 23:27.
“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12). Our Savior’s name is very important. YHWShA is the Hebrew spelling. Y’hushua (stress the shua) is the pronunciation. It literally translates as Yahweh is the Deliverer. Delivered, saved, or Rescued."

“Ok, I’ll go find my pledge and introduce her to the crew. We can fill them in on those two tonight.” Rose stood up. “I’m off, tata.” Katherine touched up her makeup and followed.
Renee stood in silent shock for quite a while. Tears crept down her face. A charity case? That’s who these people are? She thought. She chose this sorority because it was an elite business sorority. Now she saw, really saw what this sorority stood for.
She looked at her watch. 2:30, she still had time. She was also invited to the Beta Kappa Kappa sorority pledge party. It wasn’t as prestigious as this one, but she had met a lot of girls from that sorority. They seemed more genuine.
With her mind made up, she wiped her tears on a dress that no doubt cost more than her little Volkswagen Golf. Straightening her spine, she opened the closet door, leaving it open. She left the room. Each step down fueled her anger. It was ready to burst as she reached the first floor.
“Renee! There you are.” Rose said, putting an arm around her shoulder. “ I have some girls I want to introduce you to.” Renee grabbed Rose’s arm off her shoulder. Rose looked at her clearly not understanding the gesture. Instead of speaking, she spotted Tiffany, the other “charity pledge. ” She walked over and whispered into Tiffany’s ear.
TIffany’s face went through many stages, annoyance, shock, and anger. She nodded and they hooked arms and went for the front door.
“Renee, Tiffany what’s going on?” Katherine stood beside Rose. “We were just looking for you two. We have good news. Now keep this between just us girls, but, you’re both in! Isn’t that great!”
Tiffany threw her drink at Katherine. The shocked look on their faces was priceless.
Renee looked at both girls “I worked my whole life planning on this day. I thought I needed the right classes. The right sorority to make it. Now that I’m here I see how wrong I was at this sorority. I have an education, pride, integrity, and skills.” Renee looked around after the splash of the drink and the place went silent. “I see the falsehoods here. Most of you are riding on mommy and daddy’s fame and money. It takes a lot more than mommy and daddy to be successful in business. After your little pep talk in your room, which I overheard, I realized that you two especially are nothing but two rich bitches who have no concept of the real world.”
“Tiffany and I come from a different class. Sure, we don’t have your parents’ money or influence, but we have everything we own by hardwork and determination. Tiffany, let’s go find us a better class of losers!” They walked out of the door."

The clerk handed me the key and said. “Welcome to the Green Door, unit thirteen.”
Green Door? The verse from the radio came racing back into my mind. I thought I counted only twelve units. I walked to the last unti and went in. Unit Thirteen. A double bed, two end tables, and a four drawer bureau furnished the room, a door to the bath and another door… it went nowhere, screwed to the wall, with no hinges and no handle, but a keyhole -- a strange “ESS” shaped keyhole. The door was painted green!
I was too tired to contemplate the possibilities. I laid down on the bed, and fell asleep almost instantly.
I woke up a few minutes later and had the eerie feeling of being watched. I looked about the room for some surveillance equipment -- a camera or anything, but saw none. But still --
A slight, dim glow was coming from the door … no it was coming ominously from the keyhole -- WHAT!?!
I did not put on the light, but crept silently across the floor toward the green door. As I raised myself up, I was astonished to see, through the “ESS” shaped keyhole, “an eyeball peekin’ through the smoky cloud behind the green door” Far out man."

This has been a sort of refuge from the battle, so to speak.
“Every General lays down a war plan, and I am no different. Only, my plan cannot contain any hope of victory for myself. Instead, it has to be focused on fighting and defeating the despair that will suffocate my loved ones after death. The cancer may take me from you, but I shall not leave you without comfort.
“I have left these boxes of scrapbooks I made for you to enjoy and pass down. Memories of us for you to draw strength from, and to recall what you are worth to me. My life was never alive before I met you. It was always dead in the water; adrift without a reason. You become the rudder to steer me and keep me on point; our love the oars to drive us forward.
“You gave me a beautiful child. A son. No man can grasp the feeling of joy as life grows inside you and the weight of responsibility that awakens with the child asking to nurture and care for them. You, however, showed your understanding as only you could in your ability to be the ultimate provider. I love that for you.
“He is too young to know what it means to die. I fear I leave you to supply answers to so many tough questions because he is such an inquisitive child. I know you will try, though.
“I have left letters to give him as he grows up. He will, perhaps, always feel incomplete because I have left. Hopefully, this will fill some of the emptiness I leave. Words area petty replacement for presence. It’s all we have though.
“Don’t we search for immortality in some form or fashion, my love? Children are the very essence of that ideal, as they are the eternal echoes of our very being. They are the physical realization of that ideal, as they are the eternal echoes of our very being. They are the physical realization of a once-existed love between two people; the testament to the long-lived human dream of continuation. Our son, Gil, will carry on our hopes and dreams in all he does. Give him your love as you have always done for me.”
“I love you always and forever, Julia.”
Tears splashed onto the pages as Gil collapsed into a fit of wracking sobs, towered by the stacks of boxes his father left him upon his death."

Mean too.
Often times she would tear off all her clothes and run screaming, naked through the halls.
She’d even fly off tables or jump off the rails of the upper tiers.
No matter how good they would secure her in shackles; the best of restraints failed, no matter.
No matter how strong of a dose of medications, tranquilizers and such, she would end up free, wild, and maniacal laughter would fill the halls again, and again.
It would take so many guards to take her down that sometimes they had to call in back up from the local law enforcement.
One time they called in the National Guard. But after they secured her, the guardsmen became so enamored by her that they just knew they’d have to find a cell and lock her up far, far away from everybody.
How could they get away with it?
Well, no one ever visited her.
She never got any mail, well, not from people outside the prison. She did receive plenty of letters from the many infatuated ex-guards.
She never called anyone.
Heck, the prison wasn’t even sure why she was in prison to begin with. Her record was very long and extensive. She had sentences that overlapped other sentences that ended, and started anew.
So they put together a cell in the basement part of the old prison. This part of the prison looked like the kind of dungeons that old castles had.
Then they figured out a way to dolly down her food and supplies in a secure dumbwaiter. No one dared to go down to her cell; for some, in doing so, went mad with lust and some never came back from their descent.
Once in a while, every 28 days or so, there’d be such a ruckus from down below that some rookie would cave in and take a look via video technology. But to their chagrin they’d be lovestruck by her beauty.
Some said the noise was like howling, and broken concrete, but never a bar was bent, nor a brick out of place.
One day, the Warden said “this is insane, we can’t keep this up! What if the ACLU finds out?”
“We can’t lose any more guards!”
So, they sealed up the basement, filling it with dirt, and covering it up with concrete.
They kept the plumbing intat. Little, by little. One by one. Staff forgot about her. New staff were hired, and were never told about her. Eventually staff even forgot to use the dumbwaiter to feed her.
Now and then, every 28 days or so, the inmates and staff would hear a howl so pitiful it’d break the hardest heart into pieces. By now, anyone who knew about her was long gone, dead, or long gone dead.
Every so often inmates would disappear. Guards and other staff too. None suspected a thing. What would they suspect anyways? Inmates get transferred and released all the time. Guards and staff quit, change jobs, and transfer too!
Every 28 days or so, in the Boise prison of old, you can still hear her howl, and wonder, the next day where your bunkie had gone in the middle of the night."

Today would be a little different. A tall, but slender black haired girl walked up to my table. “Hi,” she said, “can I sit here?” she asked with a smile. “My name is Wendy.” I was a little hesitant to give her my name.
“My name is Pam, Pam Baxten.” We talked until it was time to return class.
The walk to my house from the school was no more than three blocks. I heard my name being called. It was Wendy again. “Wait up” she cried out.
Wendy told me of a party this upcoming Saturday night. It is only for girls. No boys allowed, no alcohol, and it will give you a chance to meet the rest of the girls. I told her I would have to check with my parents, and that we would talk at school the next day.
Friday at school I got the address and told her I would be there by 5pm. My parents told me that I had to be home by midnight. I agreed to their terms. I would leave early from the party to be sure that I would be home on time.
When I arrived, Wendy was right. It was all girls. I saw no alcohol. All was going well. We talked and I got to know all of the girls there. For some reason they all wanted to walk the town. It was total darkness outside. Only a few street lights brightened the sidewalk.
Then one of my fears was in front of me. The town cemetery was in front of me. I froze in place, “Okay, c’mon on Pam. This is nothing to be afraid of. Everyone here is asleep. I knew better. They were dead. There isn’t anyone here going to haunt you.”
“Alright,” I said. Let’s go and see what happens. Wendy finally shut up and we all went through the gate. I did see a few fresh graves and new flowers.
“Wait right here Pam,”Wendy said. “I will be right back.”
“Where are you going?” I asked.
“Don’t worry or move. I’ll be back soon.”
Good thing I had my watch. I looked and it was 8pm. It seemed like hours passed and Wendy wasn’t back. Two hours had passed and still no one. It was time for me to do something.
I heard all kinds of noises, still I didn’t see anyone. My feet began to move on their own. As fast as I could go. I was heading for the entrance. A rustling sound came from close to me. I still couldn’t see anything. “Who’s there?” I cried out. No one answered back. I was really lost and confused.
My watch showed me 10:30pm. I knew if I wasn’t home before midnight I would be grounded for who knows how long. Another sound caused my feet to take off. “Who’s there?” I cried out. Still nothing. I had to be close to the entrance. I had a feeling deep down and I panicked. Why me of all people? Did they do this to all the new girls?
I had just ten minutes to make it home. When I reached for the doorknob, my mother greeted me and said “you only made it by one minute.”
The following week at school I saw the looks the girls gave me. We talked and I didn’t let on I had been pranked.
I invited them all over for a slumber party. They all agreed to it, and my parents would be gone overnight.
When they all arrived we set up in my room. The theme was Ghost Stories. Soon the stories were told. Some I had heard before, and a few were new to me.
With one candle burning everyone sat quietly. I closed my eyes, and said “Spirits of this house reveal yourself to us.” It was really quiet in the house. Then a creaking sound could be heard. There was no one in the house except us.
Wendy had to relieve herself - too many sodas. “Wendy” I called out. She didn’t answer.
Then we heard footsteps, and her voice cried out “Who’s there?!” As the light from the candle hit her face. It was priceless, the blank stare, she had met something or someone. Did she encounter the spirit of the house? Or was it inside her alone?
Next time you enter a dark room, you might ask yourself “Who’s there?”"

There was also no clock to check the time. The only way to tell it was daytime was the serving of breakfast and dinner.
Because this was the watch pod, we were all naked except for a yellow dresslike smock. When they fed, the meals were only sack lunches as we could not be given silverware. We were given 3 sandwiches for breakfast consisting of 2 ham sandwiches and 1 peanut butter sandwich. We were served this for breakfast 7 days a week. 3 days out of the week we were given milk with our breakfast sandwiches, but we had to gulp it down in front of the guards and immediately give back the carton. Dinner, the same everyday, was two bologna sandwiches and no drink.
I don’t know how long it took me to get settled into my new living situation or how long the yelling had been going on for before I turned to the front of my cell and saw an old man roaming around on the tier. He acted as if he was lost. His light gray shirt, tan khaki slacks and green/black sneakers told me he wasn’t a fellow convict. “Who in the hell is he? And how in the hell did he get out of his cell on the most secure cell block in all of Arizona’s Maximum Security Prison?” I wondered.
The old man slowly turned my way and inched up to my cell door. “Hi Cell 6,” he seemed glad to say, “please forgive me, but I forgot my glasses this morning, and I’m having problems locating cell numbers. How are you today?” he asked, and then went on talking. “I have some new stuff for you. I got your note about the side effects, so I want you to try these.”
“Hold on a minute!” I interrupted. “Are you sure you’re talking about me? Who are you anyway? I don’t think you have the right cell.”
“I’m one of the prison psychiatrists,” he said. “ This is cell fifty-nine, isn’t it?” Then taking a step back and squinting at the number above, he smiled.
“Yeah, yeah!” he said. “I got your note about Thorazine and the side effects. Not too many people like them, but here, I want you to try these.”
The psychiatrist reached into his inside pocket and pulled out several multicolored syringes. I was speechless. I never thought I’d see a psychiatrist carrying syringes in the pocket of his coat.
“Gee, these will definitely make you feel better up the road,” he said, “but aren’t for you now. What I do have for you,” he mumbled, “let’s see… they must be in one of my other pockets…”
“Hold on! Hold on, Doc!” I said. “I’m not on any medication… I know you don’t have the right person here.”
“What’s your last name and number?”
“Combs, 280904,” I answered quickly.
“Well, well, my man must have been transferred,” he resolved, scratching his butt, and walked away down the tier.
Not long after I’d been relocated, the evening chow cart came rolling down the tier. The guards started with the end cell and moved toward the front. They unlocked each cell’s food trap and gave the prisoner whatever portion for his meal. Today was Mexican food, the worst.
When the cart was just a few cells away from mine, I saw a hand lunge out of an open port and fling a milk carton of urine and feces into the faces of the guards serving the food. It took a few seconds before I could believe my eyes. The guards stood there with the feces dripping, their serving spatulas still in their hands. Then a maniacal laugh broke the silence.
“Eat my shit! I saved that from yesterday when you punks wouldn’t give me no shitwipe. Now both of you can just eat it!”
“You’ll pay for this,” one of the guards said calmly, and the two of them hurried off the tier with the food cart.
“You did it now! You cracked off (used instead of another derogatory word) all the damn food, Ed!” said Joe.
“Hey, you mean we don’t get to eat tonight?” I asked.
“Yeah, you’ll eat,” he said, “if you want to eat off a cart with Ed’s shit all over it.”
“You ain’t serious, are you?”
Listen, man. We don’t have nothin’ comin’ tonight! That’s the bottomline, not unless you wanna eat Ed’s shit!”
About an hour later I heard what sounded like an army of guards preparing to enter the tier: there were lots of keys jingling and the sound of plastic clanking against the walls
Then a dozen Guards marched past my cell dressed in full armored gear, with helmets, batons, and riot shields held tightly to their chests. The unit sergeant had a stun gun and several other guards carried pump-action shotguns loaded with rubber bullets that can severely disabled a person. They haphazardly pulled along the emergency gurney on wheels behind them.
They gathered in front of Ed’s cell. I stood close to my cell door, I could just barely see out of my window down the tier to where they were. The unit sergeant had opened the food port, then shouted the order for Ed to step to his cell door immediately to be handcuffed.
“Are you going to cuff up?” he demanded.
Ed’s quick response was, “Yes, sir! I don’t want any problems. I am fully cooperating. I am not resisting.”
“That’s not fast enough,” said the sergeant. He stepped aside to give the gunman a clear shot into the food trap of Ed’s cell. The gun blasts roared as they bounced off the walls of the enclosed tier. Pow! Pow! Then the electric cell door came open, and the guards rushed inside. The whole tier heard the beating and Ed’s screams. I could smell his flesh burning from the stun device.
They went on beating him until the screams stopped and their kicks and punches sounded like thuds on a corpse.
“Throw his ass on the gurney,” the sergeant ordered. The guards threw Ed on the gurney, his arms and legs lifelessly hanging as he flew through the air, landing roughly on the gurney.
When they finally managed to flop all of Ed’s limbs onto the gurney, then began rolling off the tier. Suddenly, a guard called, “Wait a minute,” and picked something up from the floor. “Here’s some of the bastard’s teeth,” he said, and threw them onto the gurney. I will never forget the sound they made, like dice being thrown against the wooden ledge.
There were no witnesses to this other than us inmates, but we were nobodies. Later the guards mopped up the blood. The tier stayed quiet the rest of the evening, and there was no mention of dinner.
I stayed in the “Watch Pod” for close to 60 days and Ed never returned, but that’s usually how it turned out when the guards “rolled” you. Besides I could tell Ed lost his life that evening when I watched as the guards pushed that gurney off the tier, because his body lay slack and motionless, void of all forms of life. Just another convict to pay his debt to society with his own life, for what? Inconsequential reasons."

For 14 months I floated around aimlessly: job to job, house to house, girlfriend to girlfriend. Angry at Mom and Step-Dad for being the same idiots with my siblings as with me, I ran everywhere but home. I was no better role model. I did as Mom taught me: sex, drugs, rock’n’roll, blame the world, and I got 5 years in prison.
3/3/06: I returned home. Mom and Step-Dad still faught, argued and drank like fish. I ran, sleeping anywhere but home. I found a girl just like Mom who broke my heart. She cheated by prostituting herself. On a sex binge, I picked up a teenager and got 30 years. I was free for 6 months.
“It wasn’t my fault.” Society owed me. Never collected on that debt :) I couldn't understand why all the world was against me. After 14 years 8 months in one institution or another, lost, and the Truth found me. I haven’t been the same since.
No one ever owed me. I grew up poor, in ghettos, with abusive alcoholics, and constantly moving; TYC from 12 to 18, prison, and more prison is exactly what was owed to me. Life isn’t poker where you go “all-in,” lose, and walk away. I got what I got in life (like so many others), and looked at it all wrong (like so many others). Taught to live on nothing; to adapt to new environments; to let pain and frustration roll off of me; and to move on with life. At 29, all TYC’s Resocialization and Cognitive Life Skills rushed back. I learned how life maps from unmet needs to critical situations, to internal reactions, preparing to offend, offending, and then avoiding consequences.
My debt is to take what life gives me and work with it. To be a living example to “victims” like me and building a world instead of destroying it or letting skills and resources stagnate or pine away. This world only gives what it has - the chance to learn. Whether you do or not will determine your debts."

Now, my kids’ father and our two boys did move back to Louisiana. My parents allowed them to live at their house. My children were now attending church and had positive role models.

They purchased my psych meds and we spent the night with relatives. The next morning we headed back home.
For a little while I was sober. Then, I started using again. My parents basically looked over it. They kept taking the boys to church and instilling values in my children. It seemed the more I mess up, the more I was in and out of jail, they worked harder to let my kids know right from wrong and more than anything that they were loved. All three of them.
I got out of jail again. This time I just knew I was going to stay out. I had grown tired of that sort of life. I didn’t want to commit any more crimes, no matter the type. I; however, did anyway. I moved in with a man that everyone from my parole officer, to my parents, to my friends told me to stay away from. Love makes you do some stupid things. I still wasn’t breaking any laws. Well, other than that whole no-contact order, and my love blinded me to his actions.
I am back in jail now - have been for two and a half years. Hopefully, I will get out soon. My parents are still here for me. I’ve learned; however, that their love and kindness are better than all the money in the world. They make me feel loved when I feel hated. They comfort me when this jail life gets to me. They care when my feelings get trampled.
There are many monetary debts I owe my parents that they do not expect payback on. The biggest debt there is between us is the fact that they have never and will never abandon me. I have their love for life."

They were honest and sincere until I racked up this debt, and now they’re gone.
To the judicial system I owe a debt of two hundred and thirty-nine months of my life. A debt that takes some time to repay. However, when it’s done on paper at least it’s marked paid.
To my Lord. I’ve shamed you for my transgressions. I pray everyday to be reconciled with you.
Then there’s the debts that will never be balanced. The first is to the victims of my crimes. I’ve forever altered your life and not in a positive way. I know forgiveness is a hard hard thing to give. I let you down when I should have lifted you up and protected you. I am truly forever sorry.
The second debt is to myself. I owe a life debt here. I’ve ruined the one I have so many times, this has forever put me in the red. Forever putting myself in depression and despair.
The third is community debt. Even though judicially I’ll have balanced the books, the community is not so forgiving. I’m a two time felon. My press makes me an unchanging villain. No matter what I say, do, or have done any charge is blinded by the accounting in the public's eye.
I’ve been preparing for that fateful day when Thy open the gates and call my name. You see I’m living a shunned double standard life like in federal prison. Thirteen years gone, three years, six months to go are preparing me to walk out. One lower life form on the food chain to a larger machine.
It’s okay though. Nothing the larger prison (of life) can throw at me that I haven’t dealt with within the smaller years, except death which I don’t fear. They believe a killer or druggies can be rehabilitated but there’s no help for me.
My mind keeps playing the tally, the pros and cons. I keep better records than the IRS or even Quickbooks. What do I do? How can the books ever be balanced? I can’t climb out of the hole of debt if I’m not given the means to do so. It almost feels like the welfare system is rigged and broken.
Don’t misunderstand, I’m not blaming anything or anyone but myself for the debts I’ve accumulated. However, it is an uphill battle I feel I can’t win. I’ve changed my lifestyle, my way of thinking, but nothing else has. It’s hard to see past that, I get it. Maybe some debts are never meant to be paid.
Don’t give me your pity. I haven’t earned it nor want it. Maybe somewhere in this darkness I can be given a chance. A chance to show the change, not to erase or forget the debt, but a chance to balance the scales and maybe even see a few pluses in the budget.
I can’t clear the debt without the tools, the opportunity, the chance being taken on me, maybe even a forgiveness of debt. I’m not ready for the trash, where all the worthless things go to die. Even a long dark tunnel had a faint light at its end, just the flicker of hope to drive me on.
To a true story there’s always a moral hidden or expressed. Why should this be any different than these? Some are obvious and some you need to dig deeper within to see it clearly.
Let me shed some light on this story. What’s the moral(s) we can learn? How about change? Change is good. I guess it could also be bad, but if you start from the bottom, into the corners where the dregs are changed can only be good.
Opportunity. That is the opportunity to make the debts good or at least less negative. Nothing changed without the opportunity to do so.
Lastly forgiveness. Maybe not total forgiveness, not everyone could agree. However, if it starts with you; it may start a trend. Almost everything could be forgiven by most, don’t you think?
The sheets could be balanced, the debt paid, and we move on to a better, more harmonious life."

And how does one even place a dollar amount on the losses attached to shame, degradation, hopelessness, depression, and suicidal ideation and attempts.
Debt piled upon debt.
Lost, wasted, or stolen moments? The behaviors I engaged in when I didn’t have cash or open credit limits, but still wanted to get high.
What is, afterall, the value of a life?
My life?
Sitting here in prison, I wanted to go through the metaphorical drawers, looking for all the old bills needing attention. I aligned myself with someone to help me examine my faults, me defects of character, as it were. Of course, so as not to stay stuck, my assets were also going into the mix, allowing a more full, richer version of myself to appear.
Simply put, I would unburden myself of all that held me back, those dark recesses which I had always been too afraid to deal with. At the same time, I would then need, (and as of now), want, to make amends for my harms - in other words, pay off my debts.
Surprisingly, I’m excited, down-right eager in fact, about this process. I’m reminded to slow down. Admittingly, I’m a little nervous too. I’ve started with the easier ones. Perhaps they’re those I deemed the hurt cut less deeply? Maybe I didn’t know them as intimately?
Key to this step is working with a person who has already been through this process. For you see, at my core, one of my character defects is manipulation. So the person I work with can see through the bull. Left to my own devices, I will paint myself as the subject of a far prettier picture than reality has painted; explain myself away or avoid responsibility. Essentially, the antithesis of making amends.
A friend once compared this to selling your house. You clean and swab every crevice, rip off layers of wallpaper, replace floorboards now creaking, and spackle and paint. Voila, the same house, but refreshed, ready for a new story to take place.
As I write my amends letter, I pass it before a trusted mentor, who in turn might make suggestions. I’m told that my honesty is keeping him honest. I trust that this is so.
Usually, he’ll tell me to get to the point. Cut the crap. Eliminate one sentence, or paragraph.
I’ve done two of these so far. The road in front of me is a long one. I sit in fear and worry. How will the recipient respond? Will they ever speak to me again? Am I creating more harm? Will this be worth it? How will I feel when all is said and done? But then, my trusted friend gently chides: this is a process. A journey. Stop trying to control things. Lastly - “Let Go and Let God.” That’s the hardest part for me.
When I look at my life, my best efforts got me where I am now, so maybe I should try this “letting go” thing. Therein lies true power: being able to shed decades of grime which I’ve long defined myself by. As I grow, perhaps I can move forward into a life well-lived. The debt of my wrongs no longer hang around my neck like the proverbial albatross."

“My name’s Shawn Palmer. Marty and my son Stan here went through a little something after school today,” I told him. “I brought Stan over here so they could straighten it out.”
He said, “Marty did that to him?”
“Not quite,” I said. “Seems after Stan and Marty had some words and started getting into it, a couple of Marty’s buddies didn’t like the way things were going and decided to give your son a hand.”
Mr. Mabry turned away from us and angrily bellowed, “Martin! Come to the door!”
When the kid appeared at his father’s side, I couldn’t believe he was a 5th grader. He was a head taller than Stan and looked like his parents fed him a steady diet of buttered biscuits. No wonder he thought trying to bully someone Stan’s size wouldn’t earn him a punch in the face, all the way up until he got the black eye I proudly saw he had.
Mr. Mabry asked him, “Care to tell me again how you accidently got that shiner in gym class?”
Marty’s eyes fell down to the welcome mat.
“Well?” his father impatiently prompted him.
“No sir,” Marty mumbled, before raising his head and an accusing finger at Stan. “But he threw the first punch! He started it!”
“And you pals Robert March and Pete Nakamura finished it for you, right?” I said, mindful we’d be making trips to each of their homes after we were done here.
Marty gave Stan the mad-dog stare, and said, “I didn’t tell the other guys to get in it. I coulda handled him by myself.”
Mr. Mabry put a hand on his son’s shoulder to silence him, and said, “I don’t approve of Marty fighting, Mr. Palmer.” He reprovingly glared at the boy. “You can rest assured he’ll be severely punished.”
“You wanna punish the kid, that’s you business. I brought my son over here to get some satisfaction.”
He was a little slow on the uptake, but he got there okay.
“What, you mean so they can fight again?” he said, as if it was the most abhorrent thing he’d ever heard.
“That’s right,” I said. “They can go in the backyard, let it be just the two of them this time, and then afterwards they can shake hands.”
“Absolutely not,” Mr. Mabry said, fanning his right hand like a windshield wiper. “There isn’t going to be any fighting here.”
“Listen, Mr. Mabry, they can finish this up here and now, or in school later, but I’m not raising my boy to turn the other cheek when a bunch of cowards try to take his dignity.”
Mr. Mabry got red in the face and tremulous in the voice. “My son is not a coward,” he said.
“Then let them go one-on-one. Old school.”
He shook his head, clearly not grasping the limit of options.
So I slapped him.
He was so stunned he didn’t say anything. I could tell he wanted to make a run at me by the way his gray eyes blazed while he was rubbing his cheek. He had three inches and about thirty pounds on me. If he wanted to mix it up, I was game, only he was trying to prove himself too genteel for such impulsive barbarism.
I pointed to a clear spot out on the lawn and said, “You boys go on and handle your business.”
Marty looked uncertainly at his father, who was still gathering himself, calculating.
Mr. Mabry told me, “I should call the police on you.”
“Sure,” I said. “ Probably wanna sue me too, right?”
His jaw clenched. A tick developed in his left eye. Mr. Mabry finally took his hand away from his cheek. “Go ahead, Marty,” he said, giving his son a shove out the door.

We were eating dinner later that night when the doorbell rang. My wife Lorene went to answer it.
When she came back to the table, she told me, “Some guy’s here to see you, Shawn.”
I got up and went to the door. Sure enough, it was Mr. Mabry. I wasn’t very surprised to see he hadn’t brought his son along. I gave him a nod of greeting but didn’t wait for him to say anything, because I knew what it was about. I motioned him in and led him to the back of the house.
“Hon,” I said to Lorene as we passed through the dining room, “this is Mr. Mabry, Marty’s father. We’re gonna be in the backyard for a bit.”"

Being in a confined area, flight was not an option, so option number two was quickly entered into. Bodies bouncing off walls, tables, telephones, trash barrels, bunks, and then one of them grabbed a broom,
It was becoming nasty.
A spectator in the Peanut Gallery cried out, somewhat vociferously, “Oh no, not the broom!”... CRACK! The broom handle broke … somebody called the cops.
The cops just love breaking up fights. They came in -- guns drawn. No rubber bullets for these guys. These guys use spray-cans of … I think the same stuff the bad guys were smoking. Within seconds everyone was choking -- everyone but me, I have a window seat and the window was wide open. Fresh air galore. I did get a whiff of the bug-juice that was being sprayed and I have to admit that it did smell better than the twack shit.
The man .. I mean the nincompoop with the half-a-broomhandle did manage to land a couple of blows on the other guy before being overcome with the perfume of passion from the spray cans. Everyone was having a good time. New bracelets for both contestants and a trip to the hoosegow to cool down.
An inmate later said he thought one of the combatants was me. So I told him I was thinking about joining the fracas just for fun, but they seemed to know what they were doing and had the situation well under control -- more or less.
I don’t think the debt is paid yet.

Certainly, having closets full of clothes that are seldom used, and having a lifestyle characterized by luxury - is a tragic mistake. Most people would likely do well to take steps towards simplifying their living standards.
Money is one of the most unsatisfying of possessions. It does take away some cares, but it brings with it many additional concerns. There is trouble getting it, anxiety in keeping it, temptations in the use of it, guilt in the abuse of it, sorrow in losing it, and perplexity in disposing of it. One can be surrounded by all kinds of material things, and still sense that something is gnawing a hole in the heart.
We are told that contentment is great gain. There is a satisfaction which ought to characterize us. We must not be satisfied with what we are (for there is always room to improve our character), but we should constantly work at being satisfied with what we have, contentment does not come from having all our wants supplied, it comes instead from reducing our desires to include only the essentials of life. We are not to be caught up with the craving for more.
If we have food, clothing, and shelter, we should be satisfied. Contentment consists of being satisfied with the basic necessities of life. It is easy in this age of plenty to become obsessed with the desire to gorge ourselves with unnecessary things. Material things can really get a tight grip on us. It is easy to think that we must have expensive furniture, sleek automobiles, extravagant holidays, up to date everything, etc…
Each of us needs to strive for a happy median regarding material things, seeking to be thrifty without being miserable. It is best for most of us just to have the simple necessities of life - no more and no less.
Nothing impresses an individual with the emptiness of materialism like a trip to a dump. Take a look at everything in these places - all of it was once someone’s treasure."

Finally, and most importantly, above everything else. If you are a Believer of Christ. If you know who He is. We owe Him debts we will never be able to repay. For Him laying down His life for us, so we can be saved. So we can know God’s Mercy, we can know Grace, Forgiveness and Eternal Life.

The Love, the Compasion, Mercy, Grace, and Forgiveness They have given us.
And just imagine whether you’re a Christian or not. If you believe in Jesus Christ or not. If we were all to humble ourselves enough. Be brave enough to read how he loved and helped others. Without judgement, without price. Without reprisal to those who would harm Him. If we could walk like that. Live like that. Love like that. How much more peace we could know!!

Talk about “making love” confuses our children. Elaborate courtship rituals are almost a thing of the past. A young man thinks if a girl sees his penis, she’ll love him. A young woman thinks if she spreads her legs, a young man will love her. That’s not the way it works.
I try not to talk about making love. There are better terms, like “copulate” or “fuck”, depending upon the occasion and the company.

We made arrangements to meet again- the next night.
She told me later, that night she called the fella she had just started to date and told him they would still be friends but would no longer go out together that was all she told me then.
Four years later we were married (what therefore God had joined together, let no man put asunder).
Our life together was typical of most: struggle, adjust, struggle some more, accept and move on. We had good times, we had hard times, but we never had BAD times.
Our first child (my wife referred to her as our love child) came along and was followed by three more. Two girls and two boys. And she gave them all equal love.
We attended a year end party for the Englewood Board of Realtors in 2002. A few days later, at the board office, another Realtor asked me who the girl was that I was with at the party, and I said, “my wife”. He then asked if we had just gotten married. I asked him why he thought that. He said, “Because you two look like you just met each other.” I said “we did- forty years ago”.
I guess true love never flaunts itself-it just shows.
Three years later, during 2005, forty three years after we met, my wife died. On her death bed she told her two friends how we met and that she knew that night that I would be the one she would spend the rest of her life with… How would she know that… she was only fifteen. A marriage made in Heaven? Maybe-
Me?... I’m still making love in my mind"

Stop what you are doing for ten seconds- just stop in the middle of it- and peer deeply inside one aspect of what you are doing. Look, perhaps, at the water. See it splashing on your hands. See if you can count the drops of water on your hand. Just count the water drops, we know it is an impossible task, but undertake to do it anyway, just for ten seconds.
Now pull yourself out of that highly focused reality and back into the larger space of your experience. Don’t get “lost” in it. Blink your eyes rapidly, or shape your finger, and literally snap out of it. Then, notice what you experienced for that brief moment.
Now go on with what you were doing. Yet don’t be surprised if it takes on a whole new quality.
What you have done is truly appreciate something. To “appreciate” something is to make it larger, to increase it- as property, for instance, appreciates in value. When you use stopping meditation, you can increase the value of your life. This inevitably returns us to a place of peace.
Experience this while making love. Stop what you are doing for ten seconds, separate the moment into its component parts, select one part of the moment and peer deeply into it. Maybe it is the look in your beloved’s eyes. Maybe it is a sensation you are feeling- or creating. Just stop for a tiny moment and appreciate that moment in a singular way.
We can have regular times when we do this, and making love is one of them. Standing in the shower is another. Eating food is another. Pick up a pea from the plate, or a kernel of corn. Consider it. Appreciate it. Taste it utterly and completely. Your meal times will never be the same. Your showers will never be the same. Your lovemaking will never be the same. You will never be the same."

To be so in love with someone. When a man loves a woman so much, he’ll share her pregnancy pains, her weird hunger. As a couple. A true couple. You’ll finish each other's sentences. Almost read each other's minds. Think on the same wavelengths.
Everytime you touch or lock eyes. Electricity flows through you and the room. You’ll sacrifice everything for each other. Nothing could possibly tear you apart or sew discord.
And when your world is in chaos, when it feels like life has turned your world upside down, and you’re suffocating. And it's unbearable. Then when that person walks in the room, when you wake up beside them and hold them in your arms, you know that everything is going to be okay. Because as long as you have your love, you can make it through anything. You can walk through the very fires of Hell without batting an eye. Because you have them beside you. And vice versa.
That is the kind of love I want to find."

I was bullied or called derogatory names. Feeling self-shame at my core. I engage in a way of self-inflicted hate via internalized homophobia, and addictively unsafe behavior.
The nineties saw its share in a war of words. 1992 was pivotal for me. I was watching a political party convention. Many speakers extolled with great passion and vitriol “Family Values”. That planted a seed within me of hate for the “other” side- people who felt that anything diverse or different, such as an un-wed mother, an illegal immigrant, gays, etc, were not part of the fold. Today, I’m very much a part of the tribalism, where other views are wrong, I am right.
As that decade came to a close, activist friends challenged me to look at my own “white, privilege”. What did it mean to be white in America? How did I knowingly or unknowingly encourage systemic racism? By merely being born white, what benefits did I receive? There were not comfortable conversations. Even now, with all of this woven into the tattered fabric of American life, these are not comfortable discussions to have.
2020- societally,  we are more divided than ever. Extremes on both ends of the spectrum fight for airtime, political cover and legislative victories. Our nation is in a metaphorical war, long ago skewing a concept of love.
Humanity is on full display as a weary nurse uses an iphone in order for a family to say its final goodbyes to the family dying alone in isolation. Love rules the day.
Finally, as for myself, sitting in prison for the wrong I’ve done, well, this is not stereotypically the place where one finds love in full view. But I can still do my part in a significant way. By loving myself enough to make the right decisions to move forward, towards a purpose driven life.
Making Love, Not War. It’s not an unattainable goal, but it can be seen lost in all the din. I hold on the promise of hope, believing in time that the strains of bigotry, bullying, shame and violence can be supplanted by the chords of their opposites."

“First of all good evening to you too. And since you ask so nice, I would prolong the surprise- we’re going on vacation!” screamed mom. We’re going to Astroworld, but we’re going to attend Mr. Perry’s sister’s wedding first.
We started doing our happy dance when mom suddenly yelled, “Where are those report cards?”
“All of our grades were good so we quickly handed them out.”
We met at the dinner table at our usual time. Mr. Perry had arrived and was seated at the head of the table. He’s my mother’s boyfriend, and always seems to show at dinnertime. My Perry was a cowboy to his heart, and from the few Christmases we’re known him he’d always give us cowboy hats and boots. Neither one of us boys was trying to be cowboys. But my baby brother, he would wear his cowboy boots and rise his imaginary horse in the front yard yelling, “Bang! Bang!” all day long.
Once the dinner table was cleared, momma told us to get packing, because we’re leaving for Texas tomorrow evening.
Saturday evening we were all packed up and ready to go. We loaded up in Mr. Perry’s old Chevy pick up with the camper and headed for the highway.
Seem like we’d been on the road forever when we finally crossed the border from Lousianna into Texas. I don’t know exactly when I fell sleep, but when I opened my eyes we were pulling up to a big white house and it was leaning like the tower of Pisa.
Mr. Perry’s family was huge, there were people everywhere and lots of food too. Some of the best fried chicken I had ever tasted besides momma’s.
Mr. Perry’s nephew who they called Dam Dam pulled me by the arm and asked me to come with him to feed Lilly.
“Who is Lilly?” I asked.
Bam Bam casually said “You’ll see”
“Why they call you Bam Bam”
“Because I never wear shoes or a shirt, just my cut offs,” he answered proudly.
When we got to the backyard I noticed a big fence in the shape of a square, and there was something inside, looked kinda like a cow or a sick moose.
“What the heck is that?” I asked bam bam.
“I don’t know, my uncle won it in a poker game, and he says its a yak. But granny said that yak’s only live in the mountains, not Texas.”
“Well Lilly is ugly and smells bad- feed it and let's go” I said, “And hurry!”
It was the third day that we had been in Texas, and I noticed something wasn’t right with mom, out of the blue she decided we needed to go shopping for a few more summer clothes. Mr. Perry wasn’t there, so his sister dropped us off at the mall. I guess her and mom knew something that we kids didn’t because they hugged like they were never going to see each other again.
We never went into the mall. Mama waved down a cab. We were in shock as we got in.
“Greyhound bus station please,” She looked at us and said “Don’t ask any questions, we’re going home.”
And that was it- vacation over.
The first day of school arrived. We all left at our usual time, so momma was able to walk us to school. Back to normal, I thought.
The first thing our teacher asked us to do was to take out notebooks and write. At least one sentence about our summer vacation. I wrote three words- worst vacation ever.
The sound of crunching grass suddenly snapped me back and there it was ten feet away, a big ugly Yak! I raised my 35mm, and zipped off a few shots… I thought to myself, after thirty years, finally a real vacation."

Building things is what I like to do. I’ve built chairs and tables for our family and others. It puts little money in our pockets. A little is better than none.
A stranger came to our camp and wanted to take photos of the area. He knew nothing of the area. My father was bust and it left only me. After my father told him he was busy.
I spoke up and said I would do it. It would only take a week to do all he wanted done. The money would be more than we could make in a year. My Father protested at the idea. He felt I was too young to guide them.
Little did he know, my friend and I had travel all over that mountain, even in the blinding snow and wind.
After a couple of hours of talking, my Father gave in. At first light we would travel for our first caamp. Everything loaded and we started out. My friend wanted to be a little stubborn. He soon gave in as I pinched the tip of his ear. Just a little insurance to let him know who was boss.
On the fourth day out we ended up in a snow slide. Almost lost everything as it buried most of the supplies. My loyal yak was gone and I felt all alone. The only thing I had was on my backpack.
Two men lost their lives and all the pictures now buried deep in the drift. Once the snow cleared and movement stopped, I started down testing the snow powder.
At the bottom where I had figured most of the items would be. To my surprise, I saw movement. It was funny looking at first. I had never seen snow move like that. Most of all with two dark horns per trading upward.
I called to him. He caught my voice in the wind. Not only did he try to free himself more. The more he struggled the more I noticed the packs were still tied down on his back.
When I reached the bottom, he really acted up. I touched his forehead and spoke calmly while trying to free him. He calmed on down. I took a little effort to get him loose. Once on his feet, we started to stretch our legs before we started for home.
I found the photos and the two men that went with me. They were beyond help. Once I had them on the yak we started back. I know that we all had to be careful and not to rush.
These men gave their lives for what they loved. I was so happy to have my old friend back. He was so much fun and I could never replace him.
Now that we have a little extra, I built a room just for him that connects to our house. Once in a while he will stick his head through the door to get a glance at me.
Giving him a warm place to sleep and food, he is still my loyal yak and my best friend."

“Holy smokes, I guess my fantasies were real after all, and you’re a real talking wildebeest.

The line between fact and fiction became one.
“Now I know what drove Van Gogh. Da Vinvi, and Michelangelo, and Poe mad after drinking absinthe it opened their minds, which in turn manifested all their fantasies into an actual reality.”
“I was never a fiction, Jeremy. I was always able to speak, it’s just that other human minds weren’t open to hear me speak, because they were always on their phones, and well I could only speak softly” he wildebeest said.
After this enlightening realization the man went to the back of the wildebeest and pulled off the ice dreads that accumulated on its buttocks. “Well now that I’ve attained Animal Communication Enlightenment, I guess the only thing left to do is to pull ice dreads off your ass.”

My feet. My second left toe has a gold ring. Tarnished. My toes are painted, though chipped and faded.”
My hypnotherapist, Jen Kreitzer, had been referred to me by a friend, who had suggested past life regression therapy as a means of explaining the same dream consuming the last few months of my sleep. Gently, Jen coaxed me: “Slowly, you raise your head to take in your surroundings. Describe what you see first.”
My breathing became more labored. Chill of the early morning air tingled my spine.
A yak! I exclaimed. It was the same animal from my dreams, always with that mournful stare.
“Remember, nothing can hurt you here.”
“It’s damp, thick, matted coat reeks like old stale wool. Like that of a wet dog fresh from a romp in the rain. I have stared this animal down for years. It’s what we do when I prepare it for market. Her gracefully curved, long horns, her sign of maturity; dark long drooping eyes, that when you look at her, almost has a knowing, relatable stare. I sort of expect it to wink back.”
“I’m sad, for this is no ordinary trip to the market.”
“Why is that? What time frame do you live in? Where are you?”
“Time doesn’t have much meaning for us here, but I am clearly high up in the mountains of Asia. A remote village. My papa is in the distance urging me to hurry. He sounds tired, resigned, with a slight edge to his voice.”
“We’re going to leave this day for a moment. No, no. Relax, you’ll return shortly, but I want you to go back in time, to the last conversation you had with your papa.”
I squirmed in my seat. My muscles tensed.
“No one wants me Sangha! You are too old to marry off and that useless, good for nothing yak, too old to even produce milk, was to have been part of your dowry, but now-”
“I know papa”
“What do you know, child? You must go and sell this animal. Perhaps the few trinkets we can make will bring us better luck.” And with that, he stormed off.
“My feet are sore” I said, having returned to the mountainside. “The yak and I are plodding gingerly along. I’m yanking on the rope to lead the way. It urinates as we walk, mixing in with the mud from the deluge of rain. Long ago we passed the market, and the village temple, and finally, the edge of town. We had been trekking for several days.”
“It’s dark, early, and brisk. I’m scared, for I know I shall never see papa again. I. Oh so many-”
Again, that lilting sweet voice, “No need for tears. You’re safe now. I shall count backwards, and when you hear the chime, you will be back in the office, refreshed, relaxed, at complete peace. Ten. Nine...”
And so she counted down, slowly bringing me out of an existence long ago, one I would later deduce around the early 1800s. Then the echo of her chime. I slowly opened my eyes.
“Wow” I simply uttered, after a pregnant pause.
Finally, Jen said, “That was a big step, alphonse. No? That took great courage for you to leave everything. I think it connects with the courage you’re displayed in this lifetime, what with immigrating to this country, and all. That took guts, and -”
“Or, it connects to how I always start something, never finish. There is no resolution,” I whisper, more to myself than to Jen.
“Perhaps in our next session. In time, you’ll get there” She concluded."

“Don’t you worry too much. You’ve got the boys with you, and we won’t be gone long” He said to his nervous wife. “It’s my turn in the patrol rotation. This one will be short unless we get hit with some snow”.
“I know,” she said as a single tear slipped free. “I just worry so much every time you go. What with the raving gangs and the patrol from the other villages. I don’t want you getting killed in a skirmish”.
“I’ll be fine. Ugly will see me home safe”. He patted his yak as he said this. Then he looked down at his two sons. He opened his arms and the 11 and 9 year old boys rushed into them.
“I love you, Joseph and Daniel. You boys take care of your mom, and keep things going while I’m gone”.
Joseph, a tow herd, strapping young man, for he took after his dad in this muscle department, looked at his father with a brave look on his young face. “I’ll make sure everything is done right, Dad”.
“I know you will, son. Just as I know that, you, Daniel, will do your part as best you can”.
“Yes, sir” said the brown haired 9 year old. He stood awkwardly as his body didn’t quite line up. He had been born with kyphoscoliosis which meant his spine was slightly twisted with the @-curve of scoliosis, and a hunch from the kyphosis.
In spite of this, the little boy worked hard. He tried not to let the pains in his back stop him or slow him down. Sadly, his body was weak, and muscles building just did not come easy for him, yet, the little fella was game.
“I’ll make ya proud of me, pa” Daniel said.
With a big smile, a swelled breast full of love, he tossed the boys hair, “I’m already proud of both you boys”.
“I’ll also make sure Tommy Tomleson doesn’t bother him” said Joseph.
David smiled as he took Stacy into his arms. “You better come home safe,” she whispered in his ear. “I don’t plan to raise 3 children on my own”.
He whipped back holding her shoulders at arms length, his eyes as big as saucers. “You’re serious?!”
She nods her head with a smile that wraps around and meets behind her long dark hair.
With a whoop, David picks Stacy up and gives her a whirl. “Hey Fellas!” he bellows, “I’m gonna be a dad again!”
Cheers arise from the other men in the patrol as wives and sweethearts and daughters surround Stacy with warmth and love and giggles.
David gives Stacy one last long, lingering kiss. Then, grinning like a food, he orders the patrol to “saddle up”.
“Alright, boys!” Daniel yells, “Let’s get this over with. We got family to get back to”.
A heartfelt cheer goes up as the 12 men head out to ensure the safety of their own little village."

A slow wind, warmed by distance and laced with traces of evergreen, so fragrant, so intoxicating, so rhythmic- I fell into its magical lullaby. Cradled…
“Rock-a-by-baby...the cradle will rock...go to sleep sweet baby…” Mama’s voice echoed soft, distant, safe…
“Willow wake up you sleepy head, Dada up early and he’s in a hurry to get to the sale barn,” Mom chirped. “And you know he don’t like waiting on us girls. So rise and shine, that is if you want to be there when we pick up your pony.”
Mom brushed the hair from my face and planted a kiss on the end of my freckled nose that smelled like fresh brewed coffee and honey buns.
“Lets go!” Mama used her ‘I mean it’ voice. She pulled the bedcovers back, and… “So you’re dressed already I see.”
On the long and boring ride to the sale barn Dad was quieter than usual. Most of the time I could read his moods, but this morning- weird; Mom wasn’t saying much either. Here I was, excited about getting my first pony, and my parents were acting as if we were on the way to a cousin’s funeral.
Dad takes the exit for the Flying W truck stop. I was so glad. I had to pee, and one of Dad’s road rules was- don’t ask to stop and pee.
“Dam! Damn!! Damn it!!” shouted my father. “Did you see how that car cut me off-- caused me to clip the curb with the new tire I just put on the horse trailer, did ya’ll see it?”
I noticed a smile flash like day lightening across Mom’s face; I held most of a giggle back, but Dad, being Dad heard a hiccup of laughter that managed to escape me.
“Willow.” Dad’s voice rolled like slow thunder. “You got something to say young lady?”
“NO SIR.”
“Do you or your mother find anything funny about me hitting that curb?”
Mom looked at me and I looked at Mom, and we burst out laughing.
Dad stopped in front of the gas pumps--he looked at Mom, then he looked at me and said, “hitting the curb...was their fault...not mine.” Me and Mom cackled like two caged hens as the rooster turned three shades of red.
“Mom, open the door. I gotta pee bad!”
As I cleared the truck door I shouted back at Dad, “Not your fault, uh!”
Mom was right on my heels laughing and screaming… as I grabbed the door I heard her say, “Willow, you are sooooo bad.”
I don’t believe in Santa Claus or Flying Reindeer; I know I’m getting a pony and I’m at the sale barn, but still-- I’ve got a bandana tied across my eyes… parents, go figures.
“Surprise!” shouted my parents as Dad pulled the banada from my eyes.
“It’s old” I said at last.
“No Willow. It’s not. It’s a Shetland Pony,” said Dad.
“But, but it don’t even look like a pony Dad,” was all I could think to say.
Dad just nodded…
Mom looked puzzled…
“Willow, Shetland Ponies are supposed to be, well, long-haired. Sweetie just look at the way he’s staring at you; he likes you. And look, Dad bought you a new saddle; so go say hello to Shaggy- your new pony.”
Mom patted me on the back and pushed me forward…
“Pssss- Pssss, Willow wake up you sleepy head,” whispered Madoo.
“Uh? What the… Shaggy? No! It can’t be.”
“Willow, shhh, don’t be frightened, it’s just been standing there staring at you-- I think it likes you.”
“Madoo...”
“Where’d? Ah, how’d it get here?” I ask.
“Don’t know,” confessed Madoo.
“Madoo...”
“That’s… that’s the saddle my dad gave me when I was thirteen.”
“The summer storm Willow.”
“Madoo...”

We will have a small garden this year. Won’t be a lot, but things are looking up here. Since the area I work for is in the bottom of the list to get things fixed. Money is given to all areas. We work out in the sun all day. Even in the rain, cold, and snow. We can’t even get a nozzle for a garden hose. A less than six dollar item. It is like pulling hen's teeth (which hens don’t have.)
One thing I can say, making ends meet isn’t very hard for me. There are days I am just happy with a pack of toasted cheese crackers, or about ten saltine crackers. Our bodies need solid good food. I have eaten so much tuna that I dream of fish and the Ocean. We pay one dollar and eighty-three cents for less than four ounces of fish.
A cup of soup (shrimp) and the tuna with a little mayo goes a long way. It will make three healthy sandwiches. Of course, I drain the liquid off and some of it for mashed potatoes. No more than one day and you will have to throw out the liquid. It will turn sour.
I know that when you are in college or prison a budget is a thing that has to be controlled. Not everyone comes from a wealthy family. I work to have money to buy the important things. We all have to learn to do without.
Making ends meet has taught me that there are more important things in life than just putting food in my mouth. It is a way to learn and to pass it on to others, our future government, families, and the world needs to learn to tighten up. Save a little and eat for a better day. If not then we all will be holding a hand out for leftovers."

You can never match their money and how they live horribly, so they are still eating off of money made back in slavery and the moeny we work so hard for to give right back to them.

Although how do you rehabilitate something that was never good to start with. You may have to jump through some hoops, and you may have to want to change. How is this relevant? The idea is that prison is supposed to make you a productive member of society. One who can pay their own way, without harming others.
So that is what I’m working on. My biggest goal upon release, if nothing else, is to take care of myself. To pay my own rent on my own place. Even if it’s only a small studio apartment. Even if the only job I can get is mopping floors at McDonald’s. It will be nice to be able to sit there in my own place after work, knowing that I worked hard and honestly to get there. That I didn't have to steal or sell drugs for it. That instead of contributing to the problems of the world I actually did something to make it better. Even if it’s mopping floors at McDonald’s so people have a clean place to eat.
If that doesn’t do it for you, let me appeal to your pride. I’m sure you call yourself  a man, you likely walk around with your chest out telling people such (sorry ladies, I can’t pretend to know what you’re going through, or the issues that brought you here.). You may even walk around bragging about them hoes giving you money. You got “hoes” putting money on your books, hoes buying you clothes and paying your bills out in the world. What are you giving them in return? “Some D”? Nice gig if you can get it, but it doesn’t that make you the ho? Or let me put it another way, a woman (or man if that's your thing) is paying all your bills, cooking your meals, doing your laundry, etc… That’s not a spouse, that’s just another mother you happen to be having sex with (sophocles would blush).
You can’t take care of yourself, how do you call yourself a man? A man is an adult male. You may be male, but you sure as hell aren’t an adult.
The above describes me well (hi kettle, I’m pot), but unlike the pot and the kettle who can’t change what they are. We can. We can do better.
I wasn’t planning on writing on this topic, but after eighteen months of staying out of trouble I recently moved back to population, and when I woke up this morning, the college interest form I requested was under my door.
Did I mention I hate McDonald’s? Keep your mop and fries, I want a desk in an air-conditioned office somewhere."

Lies covered in pearly-white smiles and long-lashed hazel irises.
Her first concern was born when he took the exit to Woodville. She started to guess he needed gas in the tank, but scrapped it as he plowed past three stations. The tires ate away at the lone road heading towards the mountains, and her anxiety grew with the miles.
David said it was just a shortcut from the east-west highway to the north-south route, circumventing the city. His lie was exposed as the balding radials crunched grovel in front of a sad-looking lodge where Lee might have billeted his regiment.
He said he was just stopping for directions.
If he knew the shortcut, why did he need directions?
She pinched the bridge of her nose to stave off the oncoming headache. Her blood sugar was probably dropping; coupled with the anxiety, and it was a roaring mix. Her eyes squeezed shut while her fingertips drew circles against her nasal cavity. Then, her world lurched.
It all became a blur of flailing arms and legs within a dark mass holding her down. Arms locked above her head, she kicked blindly.
She couldn’t breathe. Why couldn’t she breathe?
Looking down at the scuffle, she stood paralyzed, unable to help herself. Her body was swallowed by his bulk. His mouth shushed her to not fight back. Somehow, if she didn’t, it would all be better.
What did that mean?
More lies gussled up with sweet nothings.
He was full of crap.
She inhaled deeply; suddenly back under him, legs tried one last gambit jerking to and fro, finally finding paydirt. Satisfaction rushed over her like the welcome freedom it was as he clutched his wounded pride. Hands now free, they tore at his face as her mouth yelled her answer to everything being alright. The retort to the volleys was a strike to her face.
Tasting blood and dirt, the ringing sang her doom loud and clear. Her legs pulled by his strong arms, she tore into the dirt, scrambling for something. Anything. Broken fingernails found purchase and she turned to share it with him.
He was closer than she thought, and the sickening thud her filled first made never sounded so sweet. He went down like a marionette whose strings had been cut. After that, it was all a hazy, red blur.
Sometime later, she didn’t know when, she remembered cleaning up, gathering some food from the house into a sack and walking out. Alive; more than she could say for Waffle-boy.
That was miles ago.
Got to keep moving.
Unaware of where she was, there was no promised rescue. The mountains were ahead; the traphouse behind. A car’s gotta pass by soon, right?"

When the tonsle of the daily has us forsee how precious life is, we tend to keep what matters from what needs to be done. Somewhere in the press of our day, in the press of a conflict that we won’t let go of, in the press of a fear that makes us forsee the deeper order of things-suddenly there;s this ship and we make what matters a reward for getting to the end of trouble. Trouble never ends. It comes and goes like clouds. This is why what matters need to come first. It needs to be a constant companion. For what matters is necessary in order to endure the weather of life. Even when we forget what matters, the foundation of life waits like a faithful friend to be found in the very trouble we move through.
Under all these useless facts speeding us through all that matters, what cannot be broken down is what’s beautful and what’s left once everything is moved out of the way is what’s true. Isn’t this what time does to us? If we don’t give up or give in, we become in time beautiful and true.
Inevitably, we all lose something along the way. We each are hurt and we each do the hurting. When we can accept this fundamental truth, we’re grounded in humility and compassion. If we fight this truth or deny it, our pain and isolation only grow. So what can anyone offer but a nod and a bow to what lives in the silence under all that we feel, which we’re very close to when pried open by life. Its the radiance of life that lines our self worth.
Submission number 2
Often parents, as they get older, start acting like children. If your parent’s behavior is improper, like gambling, drinking, or quarreling every day, advise them gently and avoid sharp words or a stern attitude. Once, a young man says proudly, “Today, my father made a big mistake, so I chastised him fiercely.” Even if his father were wrong, what he did wasn’t appropriate. Parents are elders, so we should advise them with gentle words. If due to different perspectives your parents reject your ideas, express your reasons tactfully.
There was a child who was respectful to his elders from an earl age. His father, however,
was unfaithful to his grandfather. One day, his father abruptly put his grandfather, who was old, sick, and weak, in a basket, planning to leave him deep in the mountains to live out his final days there. He pleads with his father and kneels on the floor crying, but he can’t make his father change his mind.
Suddenly, he has an idea, wiping away the tears, he says, “You have decided to discard grandfather, and I can’t do anything about it. Can you do me a favor and please bring the basket back?”
Puzzled, the father asks, “What will you do with it?” “When you re old, I will use it to discard you,” he replies.
Alarmed, the father says, “How can you say that?”
He answers, “I am just trying to follow your example.”
Shocked into understanding, the father immediately brings the old man inside and takes very good care of him from then on.
Therefore, even if your parents are incorrect and by nature difficult to communicate with, you should gradually induce them to give up their wrong actions with skillful means and avoid using sharp words or embarrassing them. If they refuse your advice, keep asking them with respect and a sincere attitude. After repeated admonishment, wise parents will eventually accept it. If you persuade your parents gently when they are mistaken, it’s much more likely that they will change their minds. That way their honor is preserved, and your duty is fulfilled."

One hundred LONG yards and not an inch more
Please don’t cross the line in the sand
One foolish boy went up fifty and danced

Is there dust there? A lot, but the stove gets quite hot
And the moldings are fancy, yet thin
You can have a good dinner, you can have a good lunch,
For the table is comfy and nice
But at night when you sleep, your clock, ticking, will creep
To the date when your blood turns to ice

The creepy poem had Taissa stopped in her tracks. Her pal Alia had parked the car a half mile back. She could always return to the vehicle and leave. But she didn’t want to be a scaredy-cat. She was almost forty! That obscure Middle Eastern poem was OLD. There was no WAY that the semitic peoples could have written it about something in America!
But still… people HAD found an ancient Paleo-Hebrew script on stones in America...maybe it COULD be true.
Whether it was real or not, Taissa wanted to see just what it was that her highly intelligent father had gone insane over. Though fear lay quietly under her goosefleshed skin, she took a deep breath of spring air and decided to begin this journey the same way her father did, the same way everyone does.
She took her first step."

I can feel the cracks of the pavement tattooed on my cheek. And realize I have to get out of here, but which way do I go? I search my pockets for some kind of useful object, Could I start a fire if need be? Hell no, I’m from the city, I’ll freeze to death. I reach into my shirt pocket and I find a paper. It’s a note. I read it out loud, after all who will hear me?
“If you’re reading this you’ll realize you’re in the middle of nowhere. Nowhere is the condition we found you in and nowhere is the place you need to find yourself out of. Good luck, I hope you make it”."

As with any other road trip, it’s all about how we get to our destination. Do we crawl? Walk? Run? Roller Skate? Hitchhike? Drive? Take a bus? A Train? A Plane? Decisions, so many decisions. I learned in math class the most practical way to get from point A to point B is always a straight line. However sometimes small side trips are needed to provide a break in the scenery and the monotony. Sometimes these side trips afford us the opportunities to take a breather, to examine the road map of our lives. To see if where we are heading is really where we want to go. Do I get to grandma’s house by going around the block and through the park, or by cutting across the city’s landfill? Both ways will get me there. When I was younger I would probably have opted for quickness. I was in a hurry, all I wanted was to be grown. Now that I am older, taking time to enjoy the journey is more important.
Sometimes, as a man, I face huge challenges with pride. I am grown. I am a man. I can do things on my own and as with any road trip, I simply refuse to acknowledge that I may need to stop and ask for some directions at times. Knowledge comes from experience. How can I know where I am going if I have never been there. Sure, there are road maps but not even they can tell you everything about your journey. Where are the best places to eat? To shop? To meet interesting people with interesting tales and lessons from their own journeys? Rand McNally is good, but not that good.
“Where am I? How did I get here? Where am I going? How will I get there, other than just one foot in front of the other?”
These questions are irrelevant and about the past. How I got to where I am or how far I have come is the past and the past cannot change. If I spend all of my time focusing on the past, my future will not change either. On the longest road, problems are never really the challenge. The challenge is how we deal with problems and allow our focus to return to where it belongs, on our journey."

She-Alexis- told me that she preferred the road to any city. “In a true anarchy” she explained, “the would-be bully knows that their fellows have as much freedom as he does to stab or betray, and this breeds caution, which is what makes good neighbors.”
“I thought fences made good neighbors,” I’d responded. She smiled, shrugged.
“What the fence represents is what makes a good neighbor,” she went on. “A fence is a boundary its a clear line that says ‘you over there, me over here.’ The potential for me to stab your eyes out if you try to harm me is another kind of boundary, the boundary of consequences.” She drew a line in the dirt between us as we sat around our small fire. “You won’t cross this line if you can assume it might cause violence, so you don’t cross- you are a good neighbor.”
“But anarchy,” I protested, “doesn’t it just mean ‘bugger your line, I do what I want?’ No laws, right? So your law against me crossing that line, isn’t that not anarchy?”
“Anarchy is not the absence of laws,” she denied, “but the ultimate individualism of law. No courts, no police, no politics- just me and you acknowledging our mutual sovereignty. And I have fought too long for my sovereignty to give it up again. I quite like being queen of myself.”
Of course, she wasn’t inclined to travel to cities with me, so we parted ways. Still, I respect her choice. It isn’t for me, but who can say if she’s wrong? Not I.
Still, I think often of Queen Alexis, and I wonder now and then if I will maybe be a bit too… sovereign for a city. With everything I’ve sacrifice to get this far, and with these last couple months of travel to complete- all through the most challenging terrain, I might add- will I be able to cope with civilization again? Will I chafe under the restraints of social norms, of a landlord, a magistrate, the city watch, and all the little expectations of “proper behavior” one finds in “civilized” places? Will the nice people of the town smell the stink of the road on me, will they see the dirt and scars, and think “savage”?
Well… perhaps I am a bit savage now. King Savage maybe, eh? We shall see."

I was indoctrinated to the convict code and a new hierarchy-- which I quickly and sadly learned I was at the bottom of. I couldn’t sleep. I barely ate. I was hemorrhaging friends and family. I was falling deeper into the well and could barely make it out any light.
But as the everyday doings of my “real” life-- dinners out, week-ends with my daughter, steady stream of Tinder dates-- fell away completely, I began to notice the continuous present that had replaced it. For someone “on-the-new” being vigilant of your surroundings equates survival. I had to quickly devolve into a more highly tuned, instinctual being. The law of the jungle is clear: the weak become easy prey.
A life barren of my real world idiosyncrasies was surprisingly simple. My only goal was subsistence: sleeping, eating, hydrating, and, occasionally, bathing. I no longer felt guilty about ignoring emails or not returning calls, no longer worried (as I constantly had) that my various girlfriends and lies would catch up to me or that I wouldn’t fall in love in time to have more children. How curious to realize that so much of my existence was a construct that could be exploded overnight; and how curious too, to see so clearly how little all that “stuff” really meant in the grand scheme of life. It wasn’t that staying in touch or having children were unimportant, but staying alive and in control, mattered so much more.
Meanwhile, I quickly became aware and appreciative for the bonds we forge as human beings. I was so moved by the handful of friends and family that stood by me and were willing to try to help-- all in their unique and special ways. Relationships with family were stripped to their core, as if the years with all their distancing had now come to nothing. My parents and sister cared for me as a child, and with few expectations, I gave in gracefully. To receive these blessings was humbling and an inspiring testament to the fact that many people are basically good and loyalty truly exists. It was like attending my own funeral and seeing who would attend and truly mourn and who would simply go through the paces for appearance’s sake. Most of us will spend a lifetime not really knowing who to trust and who loves us-- I did.
When I was finally allowed to go to yard (outdoor recreation) late that winter, I began to spend those forty-five minutes roaming the expensive rec area wearing grey sweats, black boots, and a blue knit cap. I often hadn’t showered or even brushed my teeth, but I didn’t care-- who was I trying to impress? This new lunacy of mine was strangely liberating as was losing all the old social etiquette rules I always felt compelled to follow. I stayed mostly to myself and minded my own business until I felt like I was the invisible man. It’s amazing what dark magic these walls have- they are able to take so much from a man. But, strangely, I reveled in this new anonymity, this feeling of non-existence, of the unexpected pleasure of becoming a deserter of the real world. Oh, I knew I still existed-- I hadn’t completely unmoored-- but, I lived in the fringes. And so it was that I crunched through the snow watching my breath, dreaming of a different past and unknown future. I fantasized about the book I’d write now that I had the time or the great physique I would soon have now that I would be pumping iron with the rest of the gym rats. Sometimes I even praised myself for having withstood the onslaught of hate and anger my arrest had caused and now this incarceration; and for finding a way to stay positive through it all. Human beings are resilient, I said to myself aloud. You are resilient, came the voice from deep inside a secret chamber of my heart.
It's been five years since my initia; incarceration and prison life has become my new normal. I am no longer the invisible man. I have friends, job, and volunteer duties (I also shower and brush my teeth regularly again). But every so often, I think back to those first new months and its revelations-- to the strength (and weakness) of my relationships, to my mother’s unconditional devotion, to my liberation from the real world and the faith it gave me in my own toughness. And that’s when I am overcome by gratitude from being alive, yes, but also for having known, just for a moment, the strange exhilaration of being dead.
My journey has no foreseeable end, but I know now that whatever new mountain may hide around the next bend will not break me. I will endure… regardless of the pain. This time spent at one of America’s many gray bar human warehouses has taught me an invaluable lesson: freedom can be found through pain."

Under fluffy clouds sky-

To oceans blue,
Their moisturized lies,
Cowering over you-
Like the way I did,
Standing over you,
In your pool of blood,
Swimming in death,
Taking your last breath,
That I gave for you-
Now, my mountains are concrete,
My clouds are stainless steel razor wire.

There was race war, family feuds, patracide, matricide, rape, theft, and on and on. I was an intended target myself.
My neighbor in my apartment complex had some sort of grudge against me. I don’t know what it was. Maybe he was angry that I had a real good tech job. I was, am, a nerd. Card carrying member of the Geek Squad.
Maybe he hated the fact that I was a nerd. That I had friends over on the weekends for three days of gaming and hanging out.
Maybe he hated the fact that I was considered, by others, a good looking and likable guy. I always had ladies over every day of the week. Some even played in our games on the weekend. Needless to say, I never went without.
Maybe he was just jealous of my happy, carefree life. Whatever it was he hated about me caused him to bust into my apartment with a butcher knife.
That was stupid. Never bring a knife to a gun fight. Did I mention that I own guns? Yep. I am also a history buff.
When he kicked the door in, I was wearing my Colt .45 1911A1 on my right hip. He didn’t even pause. He came in screaming with that knife held high above his head, and the light glinting off it like he had taken time to polish it first. All I did was draw and shoot.
Double tap.
Two rounds to his sternum. I know I shredded his heart. I also know that with law and order broken down in the big cities it was time to leave.
I grabbed up my A.L.I.C.E. pack with its aluminum frame, packed it with a few changes of clothes and some cold weather stuff, food, and ammo. I also stuffed some canned goods into my socks and tied these to the frame of the pack. An old Vietnam era trick.
I had canteens attached to loops on the pack, and two more on my pistol belt along with the aforementioned .45, a machete, and a big Bowie knife. I also had several clip pouches for the .45 and the M1 Carbine I had slung over my shoulder.
I hit the road.
Now, here I am days later, alone, trudging toward the pass in those distant mountains that this lonely road leads to.
I have no idea what has become of my friends or my lady loves. I left. I took no time to look anyone up. Does this make me cold hearted and selfish? Or does it make me smart and survivalistic?
Personally, I feel smart. A little lonely. I miss having friends around. I miss waking up to a pretty, sleeping face, and the warmth of a female body lying next to mine. I miss cold beer.
What I don’t miss is all the politics and BS of the old world. Old World, wow! Only days ago it was the Whole World. Now its the Old World, and I’m trapped in this New World of survival. A world of kill or be killed.
I’ve killed.
If it’s my life or theirs, I’ll kill again. I’ll help whom I can. I take down the bullies and the despots, and the petty little king wannabes. I’ll help the helpless, and the downtrodden. I’ll kiss the girl…
Okay, let's be honest… I’ll do a lot more than just kiss her. But, if she says “No”, I’ll just pack up and leave. We need to have some civility and No means No.
Always has, always will."

At age 18, each child in my mother’s family gets to draw on a scholarship trust. I suspected I might be seeing either Nathan or Joel as men in some hazy, far distant future. I wrote a series of letters in two journals, one for each of my sons. They were full of explanation, family history, everything I could remember about their early childhood. Nathan used to love blue trucks, except he couldn't get out the “Tr” sound and instead replaced it for the “F” sound. He would babble on about his favorite topic, the blue “%uck”. Joel liked being a naked boy, he would scream if clothes were put over his diaper. He did consent to being wrapped in a blanket. Both my sons were very finicky eaters. I discovered the trick to it all. They would eat anything with goldfish crackers as an ingredient. Vegetables, fruit, any dish as long as it had identifiable goldfish, the boys would chow down. The journals filled up over the years.
Then, one hot July day Captain Bracey showed up in my dorm and told me to walk with her. We ended up in her office at which I realized she had personally retrieved me. This is never a good thing. She asked me if I needed to be cuffed because there was bad news. I assured her I was alright but my stomach was in knots. Cold sweat broke out all over my body.
Uncle Dirk came on the phone to tell me that Rachel picked up my sons from camp the previous week. On the drive back home to Rhinebeck, they were killed by a drunk driver. So that is it. I still have the journals. Can’t bring myself to do anything with them."

My heart sank a little as I drove away. Fort Lauderdale bound for a lifeguard convention. Talk about Bikinis and old swim trunks. Some of them would leave a lasting impression. One that I hope would soon leave my memory banks.
My three day trip after the convention was well on the way. Since I had never left Florida, mountains would be a beautiful sight for me. My heart was set on seeing the Colorado Rockies.
The late John Denver had a way to express his feelings in songs. My heart was to sit on the rocks where he had sat and run my fingers over the words of his song. I had never seen an Eagle fly. Only on Nature shows at ETV. This really had been one of my dreams.
Time has a way of losing you as the miles clicked by. Seemed just like last night I was in Florida. Now the traveling was coming to an end. I could look ahead and see rows of beautiful mountains in the fading sunlight.
Clouds appeared through the broken sky and on the right the moon appeared in it’s quarter phase. My heart beat with pure excitement. Soon I would be listening and reading the words of the “Rocky Mountain High” song.
The mountain that he sang about had special meaning to me. I wanted to close my eyes and just float away. Just a few more miles and I could do just that.
Pulling in the parking lot, I grabbed my disk player and adjusted the headphones. My legs were shaking with excitement. When I stopped, my feet touched the same rock that Mr. Denver had sat on. I pushed play and the music sent me back to that time. With my eyes closed, I could float away on Eagle wings. Each word was crystal clear. Tears welled up in my eyes. All my life I had listened to his music and it made me feel like I was part of his life.
I heard a voice say, “Are you alright sir?”. My eyes opened to see a park ranger and I explained that I had driven from Florida to see this wonderful sight. That I had wanted to see these mountains all my life.
We talked about Mr. Denver’s life and how it was so thoughtful that people still cared for his music. I told him I was the one who felt honored. He helped to change my life completely. That enjoying the rest of my retirement would be easy.
The love of beaches to mountains, nothing beats a great tune, a beautiful view, and most of all, the feeling of being free. To seal it all, an Eagle flew over head and called out."

For me the resilience comes from those who have given me a reason to fight. For a higher purpose, to be a better person.

Those affected have something in common- Resilience.
You can knock people down, destroy homes and families, yet somehow people always survive.
But they don’t just survive, they thrive on an unbefore known strength they didn’t know they possessed. It’s instinctive.
Sure it’s gonna be difficult, especially when in our lifetime we have NEVER experienced anything like this, that requires us to take unprecedented steps to combat the spread.
We don’t know what tomorrow will bring, but what we do know is that those who are struggling will get help.
People do amazing things when we hurt. Neighbors will help neighbors again. Long lost friends will check in. Food will be delivered. People taken care of.
The most common thing said is “We will get through this”. We will. There’s no doubt.
Humans are remarkably resilient. It takes all sorts to pull through these challenging times. We must never forget those who succumbed to this unseen predator.
Nor can we forget the brave men and women who sacrificed everything in the fact of danger to protect the rest of us. The world is lucky to have Nurses, Doctors, EMS, Police, Truck Drivers, Cashiers, Store Stockers, and many others who continue despite the dangers to themselves and family.
Rebuilding will take time. It will not be easy. Being Resilient is part of our true inner nature. So is helping each other.

Resilience is being able to come in here, see its full stupidity, its hate, its dehumanizing, and adjusting accordingly without fully participating in it, or taking on its language and mannerisms.
This is a temporary residence, not our human. This is a bunk we sleep in, not our house. We don’t live in these dorms/wings alone. So many people take no consideration for those with whom they must share a living space. Rude behavior is accepted and it should NEVER be accepted or tolerated. You didn’t tolerate it out there, why do you put up with it in here?
But even more is leaving here, and re-entering society. The shock of leaving here can be pretty profound depending on how long you were inside. A lot changes in 5 years or 10 years or more. Here again some of us are able to adjust pretty easily.
Some of us are able to go with the flow no matter what the changes may be. We are able to adapt, overcome, even improvise. Of course this doesn’t mean we take on the bad habits of others, or conform to their idea of the norm. We adjust so that we can live no matter where we find ourselves. We’re respectful of others even if they are not, or even flat out refuse to be. We take others into consideration. It’s not about me. About that other person.
It’s about doing to, or for, others as you would want done to you, for you. Not everyone is resilient. Not everyone can adapt. These people are bitter, centered on self, what the self wants, what makes self happy, and damn everyone around them. Those who can adust, who can change with the changes in their life are miserable and try to take others down with them.
Adjust with your life situations. Find your joy and happiness, but be mindful of those around you. You never know another’s emotional or mental state. Just because you like to play your music of choice loud doesn’t mean your neighbor wants to hear it.
Slamming that domino doesn’t get you extra points, and is angering others
Your friend’s not a dog, so whistling at him because you’re too lazy to walk over isn’t cool.
Don’t use prison or anything else as an excuse to be dehumanized, or to dehumanize others. Show resilience. Show that you can adapt and change.
Show that you can be better than your environment or your situation."

Just the other day when they let us out for 20 minutes for shower and phone calls, as I was walking past someone’s cell, they said “the same thing that makes you laugh makes you cry” and then he cracked a joke that really was funny and made me laugh. It was a least expected funny moment. That laugh lifted me momentarily out of this horrible situation just enough to make it livable. It was in that subjective moment that you can create resilience through humor. I heard Jamie Fox say a long time ago that “If you can find humor in anything, you can survive it”. It’s crazy but it’s true! In the bible, Proverbs speaks about “Laughter is good medicine” and just as our physical immune system protects us from toxins in our environment, our psychological immune system protects us from the toxins generated from psychological stress that we experience in the world around us. While our immune system produces antibodies to help protect us from biochemical toxins, our psychological immune system also produces “Antibodies” to help protect us from psychological toxins. I discovered and learned that humor strengths both our physical and psychological immune systems. This is because laughter increases the “Immunoglobulin A”. This is why in Proverbs someone else discovered that humor helps to sustain the psychological immune system because it alters how we feel, how we think, and how we behave. So human and laughter not only helps relieve distress and fights environmental toxins when they occur, it also regenerates our “Antibodies” so that it increases the antibody levels and helps sustain Resilience. As we experience laughter and humor, we “stock up” on psychological antibodies. So when a potentially stressful situation or event occurs, psychological antibodies are then activated to address our emotional distress. This is what I discovered during this COVID-19 pandemic that laughter and humor changes our biochemistry as well as our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. William Shakespeare said that “Nothing is good or bad. It is thinking that makes it so”. Meaning when we change the way we think, we change the way we see things. In closing… regardless of what your level of resiliency is now, you can strengthen and increase it. The good news is that the ability to cope during life’s tragedies and the ability to bounce back can be learned and developed. We can’t control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond. This is my understanding of what Resilience is to me and how being Resilient saved my life. We can make it through this and in the process we can learn. We can even emerge stronger than before. No pressure, No diamond!"

He was twitching with nervous tension and shifting his weight from foot to foot, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket.
I kept a watchful eye on him as I shuffle along at a slow pace. All of a sudden, 3 hispancis stormed out of the middle of the chow line hurriedly running towards the anxious man, with long shinning homemade blades at their sides. All 3 of them suddenly attacked him, stabbing him numerous times repeatedly.
It was a vicious attack not leaving much chance for the victim to defend himself much less attempt to cover up to avoid some of the more lethal attack attempts.
All of the sudden my body quivered at the sound of a prison alarm shrieking like an out-of-control bull-horn. I instantly fell to the ground interlocking my fingers on the back of my head, face down against the asphalt as the guards began yelling “Get on the ground! Get on the ground!”. I then head rapid gun shots. Pow! Pow!...Pow! Pow! Pow!... Pow! Pow! The shots came from a gun tower not far from where I lay face down on the pavement. I knew for certain all parties were dead without even looking as the guards only fire live rounds. My mind froze.
After the prison came off of hard lockdown, which means no movement by any inmate for any reason (even medical won’t see you during the times of hard lockdown), when I found out about the news. Apparently, the nervous twitchy guy in his thirties was named Joe, and he was in debt for drugs over $2,500.00. He had been stabbed eighteen times, and shot once in the thigh by one of the tower gunmen.
An inmate whom I was familiar with and witnessed the stabbing told me, “He was crazy. He never stopped fighting. They told him to stop, but he kept going. It was like he was chasing death and wasn’t going to stop, no way, until he caught it- until he rode it out of here.”
This was an everyday norm. Just another day in Protective Custody. I never figured out how this was classified as such, because I’ve never been protected from anything, but those times are for another story."

To gain a habit and regress
I have no faith in lucky charms
I carve my pain into my arms
This disruptive static fills my head
Maybe I’d be better off dead
More than a pretty face on this endless dope chase
Its reality I am trying to escape
So I poke another hole
I smoke another bowl
I tear another piece of my soul
It’s like I am a fallen flower
I am tattered up and shattered
It’s like I am a dark princess locked away in some far away tower
Insane with loneliness
My heart is homeless
Hidden in a shadow
By a darkened dungeon
That no one knows
You discovered my hidden face
Glimpsed my soul
And ran like all other to another
Again my shadows and I are alone
Staggering about numb
Breaking all the mirrors
As not to see

All that remains is a memory
A flower for my heartless soul"

“Oh you silly ant! Faeries don’t eat aphids or pollen and chlorophyll would probably make us sick! Faeries live on honey from the bees, berries and nuts from Mother Earth and water from our sister the brooks and spring in the meadows”.
Curious, CJ asked, “What is a berry or nut; what’s a bee and where do they get honey and how is a spring your sister? What a confusing would you hive in”.
“CJ, don’t you know anything? The bees are those flying, bugging creatures who visit the same flowers you do. They drink a flower’s nectar and create honey for us.

“Well, I’ll be jiggered,” responded CJ “I thought the queen was my mother. Are you quire sure?”
“Oh you silly ant! Of course the queen is your mother, but the Earth Mother gives life to us all and has since the beginning of time. We faeries love all creatures as our family so we only eat and drink those gifts freely given by our brothers and sisters. Mother made faeries to speak to all creatures, great and small, to tell them of our family and share the Love of Mother,” Addison told an overwhelmed and confused ant.
“But sister, I have no gifts to give you since you cannot eat aphids nor drink chlorophyll. I’m not a very good brother” CJ sadly moaned.
“But CJ, you’re a great brother! You shared your knowledge with me and made me laugh. You generously offered to share your meal with me and patiently listened to the message Mother sent me to share: My life has truly been enriched by meeting you,” explained Addison.
“Imagine that! A tiny fellow like me has enriched the life of a Faerie! I guess I am a great
brother!” boasted an exuberant CJ. “I am so glad you stopped by to chat, Addison”.
“As am I, little brother. Please take the message of our Great Mother back to your colony CJ, so that all creatures, great and small, might come to accept all beings as their brothers and sisters so we can all live in peace and harmony.”

The flower summoned the wings of the wind,
And leaned into her face.
They stared at each other for quite a while,
Then the flower said with grace:
“You may have form and mobility
While I’m fixed on a slender stalk,
But I have no place I wish to go,
So I have no need to walk.”
The fraulein listened intently
To the flower’s argument,
And thought about where the flowers go:...
Only where they’re sent.
The fraulein told the flower,
“I’m going to the fair,
And if you’d like to join me,
You can ride upon my hair.”
The flower gazed upon the stream
Of flowers round her head,
And wondered how nice it would be
To sit up there instead.
The flower ask of the fair,
What would the flower see?
The fraulein told of all the sights,
“Plus you will be with me.”
“That all sounds nice, but how can I get up upon you head,
For my roots go down deep in the earth--
The earth which is my bed.”
The fraulein thought and then she said,
“I can cut your slender stem
Then place you in the garland stream

He reached into his backpack and pulled out one of the pickle and pimento loaf sandwiches that his wife Carol had thoughtfully prepared the night before. He opened the sandwich bag with great care not to make too much noise and took a large, satisfying bite.
Just then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the stag. He came out into the clearing, staying close to the tree-line. He was a beautiful white-tail buck, a twelve pointer, with an impressive pair of antlers. His nose was twitching nervously, and one hook hung frozen in mid-air below his massive chest.
Craig slowly put down his sandwich and reached for his weapon. Pulling the stock to his shoulder, his eyes never left the buck. As he sighted the deer’s quivering front, Craig imagined that he could see the creature’s beating heart beneath the grey pelt. He clicked off the safety and drew in a deep breath. Slowly he exhaled, a plume of breath that blossomed in the cool fall air. When he had emptied his lungs, he pulled the trigger. The gun’s report broke the still morning air, its echo richocetting in the distance. But instead of seeing the big deer’s fallen carcass, he only saw the twitch of its tail as it disappeared into the forest. Craig was dumbfounded. He knew that he had hit that deer, but nevertheless it was gone.
He dropped out of the tree-stand and ran over to the spot where the deer had been. There, sprinkled on the leaves of the bushes around the spot of grass, were drops of blood. His bullet had found its mark. Now Craig would have to track down the dying creature.
“Shit,” Craig whispered to himself. He ducked under a tree branch and began to follow the spoor.
He had only walked a short distance when he came upon the fallen deer, but to his surprise, standing next to the deer was a small girl. She was wearing a long white dress that fell to her ankles, and she stood barefoot in the clearing. Her chestnut brown hair cascaded in curls down her slender back. Around her forehead was an ivy garland laced by tiny white flowers. She was bent over the deer, and pulling at a cluster of flowers growing on a hedge just behind the deer’s body. She pulled the flowers from the bush and laid them tenderly on its lifeless form. She knelt by its side and placed a soft kiss on its blood-spattered muzzle. She then whispered something into its ears that Craig could not hear.
Suddenly, the deer woke. Its ears twitched and in a panic it shot to its feet and stood bewildered in the clearing. It looked first at Craig, then at the little girl. It bowed its antlered head low in her direction, turned and bounded into the deep forest’s cover.
Craig stood confused, his empty weapon held impotently in his hands.
“What just happened?” Craig asked. Then he pointed to the little girl. “Who are you? What did you just do?”
“I am the spirit guide to all the innocent animals. And that deer’s life was not yours to take.” She walked towards Craig with a confidence that betrayed her tender appearance. With one hand she took Craig’s empty weapon from his slack, unbelieving grip. Inexplicably, he allowed her.
“This instrument of death is your no more. This forest is sacred, and its creatures are all precious gifts whose lives are to be cherished, not taken for idle pleasures,” she said with a serene grace.
Craig began to regain his senses, but before he could protest she took the rifle in both hands and snapped it in two over her knee. She held her hands, palms down, over the broken pieces and sang a soft song in a language Craig had never heard before. A warm glow issued from her fingers and warmed the entire clearing. She stood and walked back to Craig and took his trembling hand in both of hers, pulling it to her chest. She leaned her head against his hand and continued to sing.
A tiny sprout issued from the ground, and with seemingly no effort began to grow. First into a sapling, then into a young tree and then into a proud and mighty oak whose leaves and branches disappeared into the canopy above.
Craig, who had been watching the tree rise, looked back down to the little girl but found himself alone, in a clearing in a peaceful forest. Confused, he wandered back to his truck and drove away."

As most are aware, being in RHU leaves you with literally nothing. A concrete bed, toilet, sink and in some cases, a in cell shower.
At my institution, books are brought around weekly, letting you check out up to 4 books of a list 12+ pages long (side note- if it wasn’t for G. Francis who donates his entire state check to buying new books for RHU, mainly educational, it would be limited).
These books have helped me tremendously. Growing up I literally thought I knew everything. My mom made that statement all the time.
Turns out I don’t.  But I grew to like to read books that challenge my way of thinking. I’m a very vocal Republican, but that doesn’t stop me from pursuing Democratic points of view. I don’t agree with everything that's said, but the point is to be enlightened.
I’ve learned to read all subjects. One topic that really challenged me were books on ethics. If it wasn’t for the glossary, I would’ve been lost.
A couple years ago I was launched into the subject of Civil Law. Boy oh boy is that subject endless. Research is tedious, but most people hate it. Expect me, I do enjoy it.
This was a pinnacle moment in my prison journey. It started by helping me navigate a civil mess. But during this mess it opened my mind to something I enjoy. Before my release in October 2022 my hope is to become a certified Paralegal.
Those small steps starting with reading books led to a moment on mental nourishment that continues each day. It took baby steps, but the nourishment I received came from books rather than the people around me.
I understand that it may be difficult for some people to sit down and hold a book. But start small. It literally might change your life as it did mine."

I weep as my home retreats through the back window of my mom’s ‘79 Pontiac Formula.
I am nourished
Age six to nine:
We moved four times in three years .
I am nourished
Age fourteen:
Friction with my step father prompts me to call my dad, “ hey, do you think I could live with you?”  Dad is playing step father to his girlfriends kids; one girl and one boy, mirroring my sister and me- whom he ignores. “Sorry kid, we just don’t have room.”
I am nourished
Age fifteen:
Coming through the door into the Neonatal Intensive Care unit. My girlfriend and I see tiny Justin lying on a table, chest heaving, limbs convulsing, shuddering… dying.
I am nourished
Age nineteen:
I am awakened by rapid knocking on the motel door. “Uncle Ed! What are you doing here?” “ I need you to get dressed and come with me; I’ll explain everything in the car.” In the car he says, “your mom’s being airlifted to the hospital. She has a brain aneurysm.”
In the waiting room, I realize we are directly under the NICU where Justin fought, and I quietly acknowledged the counterpoint.
The doctor enters and I see my mother being pulled away like my home through the back window of that old Pontiac.
And I am nourished
Nourishment is that which sustains life and promotes growth.
Suffering - when we’re in its midst, we swear it’s killing us. Looking back on the most painful events of my life, however, I see it was the terror-stricken heart of a confused, abused boy that feeds the fiery passion to be an ember of change in this dark, cold world today. And that pitifully dependent adult child would never have ventured to join the path to becoming a man had not his enabling mother been torn from his infant grasp.
“ ….suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and
character produces hope…”
Nothing is so nourishing as hope. Hope is that great element of the human spirit that resists the oppressive tyrants which war against the instinct to persevere. Without hope we are lost. And hope finds its conception in suffering. Without suffering, we could not know endurance. It is endurance of trials that builds character. Only those with character possess the hope to survive.
When was the last time you embraced suffering, scarfed it down like a starving vagrant at a buffet? The thought is intensely counter-intuitive, but those who’ve dared to, have to set their corners of this world ablaze with purifying fires.
“ Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the Earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
These probing words, uttered by a man who, more than any other, leaned into suffering- reveal a painful truth so obvious we see it daily without note: growth requires death. The nourishment of all living bodies demands the suffering of lesser biological agents. In a relative way, the nourishment of the spirit demands that mind and body suffer.
The spirit is the apex of the human construct and the physical and emotional suffering we endure nourishes that immortal facet of our being. It’s painful when we are confronted by difficult trials; but so is it painful to plants and animals when they are cut down. Painful but necessary.
On the eve of His execution, Jesus said something thoughtful that hearts will find haunting, “If anyone serves me, he must follow me…”  This same Jesus- speaking through the prophet- said: “I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; I hid not my face from disgrace or spitting. I have set my face like a flint. Follow me.” He says.
Shying away from suffering is akin to refusing to eat. The end of that course of action is death. Our lives on this planet are inescapable temporal. We will either starve our spirits in a vain attempt to preserve what must fade; or we can rejoice in the hardships which nourish that lasting component of our being.
“ I have set before you life and death. Choose life.”"

The first was my chemistry teacher. Mrs.A was the first, and only, to give me a failing grade on a report card. I was accustomed to “goofing off” and still being able to get A’s and B’s in all my classes. This lady recognized my arrogance and sent me a no nonsense wake up call: sometimes you have to work to achieve a goal. I got the message and was able to work my way to a “B” by the end of the semester. Then, there was my junior year english Lit teacher: Mrs. D. She was newly minted and doing her “practice year” to finalize state certification. This meant she was only about five or six years older than her students; and lordy, she was a homecoming queen gorgeous. But, and that’s “BUT” in bold caps, those were not the reasons no one missed her class. Mrs. D had a way of making Chaucer, Shakespeare, and other classics authors both interesting and relevant to 16 and 17 year olds. I was able to keep in  touch with Mrs. D and her husband outside of class which led to my first steady girlfriend. It was rather ironic how that worked out. She was one of the school’s hotties and I teased her mercilessly before, during, and after class. As a techno geek, I did not think I had any chance with Sue and I spent a blissful year together because college took us down divergent paths."

Then, when I was down to one week left in the hole, one week before going back to the mainline and getting a semblance of privileges and limited freedom I received a letter written on fancy stationery. Not even written, it was typed. The return address was unknown to me, as well as the name. I tore open the envelope and only then did I look on the back of it and noticed what we call a “money stamp. Once a letter lands in the mailroom of a prison it is opened, searched, read, and if any photos or money orders or checks are enclosed they will be taken out, the money orders/checks will be forwarded to the treasurer to be processed and the envelope would be stamped, letting us know that in 30 days once it clears we will have such and such amount of dollars in our prison account. The stamp read $1,500. One thousand and five hundred dollars sent to me in a fancy envelope, but from who?
I began to read the letter, and a guy named Gary explained to me that he was my friend’s son, and that she had passed away, but my letter to her arrived in time and he was able to read it to her in the hospital. He went on to say that one of her requests to him was to send me $1,000 to assist me with commissary. He decided to read all of the letters I had written to her before doing so, and after reading the love and respect and gratitude I displayed to her in our exchanges and seeing how I made his mom happy, he decided to send me $500 dollars of his own money as well. He felt it was the right thing to do. He requested that I not write back and wished me nourishment on my journey. Thank you for listening."

I said, “Please don’t.” She goes over my pocket with a wand. I ask again if I can leave. She says only out of the airport. So she instructs me that all items were to go into the change bowl. So then I say, “Please don’t.”
She said, “Why?”
I tell her, “Because it’s embarrassing.” Then she asked what it was again. We go back and forth with this stuff. I realize it’s Chicago. Problem is, she does too. I got through the storm with unorthodox strategy. I’d simply forgotten to shift the item beforehand to a more appropriate location. I’d have been better off being more focused. Instead I brought a discman and rollerblades.
So if you don’t want to get arrested in Chicago, don’t play with TSA, as Chicago knife laws are fascist. And don’t get foggy. Not all will go for this. I got real lucky thanks to her and Leon.

Mahaffey",,No,2020.0,04 - April,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/House-acdbb9748e7e44aab14d0d562e194111,Kelly Yu,"February 24, 2021 4:43 PM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wh1W7m1pwXj8T4_BoEfoUg3Us68TFW2ChEtfQmYWlcI/edit,No,"All of her instincts had told her during the COVID-19’s original outbreak, to stay on familiar ground, and away from the cities, but her want of a bana was too strong. If only she had gone to Laoang instead of coming to North Carolina, things would be different. Immediately she had regretted the marriage- a promise to a man that knew nothing of love. Not her kind of love. Her first red flags should have been how, in his jealousy, he had made her ghost her own adopted brother, Johne.
He would know what to do. Johne had been her best confidante.
Now, with internet services virtually gone, she had no way to find her lost brother. With two-thirds of the world’s population either dead, or sick that they wished that they were: communications were down, companies were gone, and resources were spread out. Facebook and other internet companies had no national connections, and connections that did exist were only localized services, nothing national. Worldwide connections are a thing of the past, putting her homeland quite literally… a world away, and out of touch. And in some eerie case of irony, the last she’d heard of Johne, was that he had left for the Philippines in search of her -- and their friends -- to help where he could during the epidemic’s fourth wave. Now Leery was less than hundred miles from where he grew up, and Johne was where she had grown up.
She missed him always helping her, there to assist with homework research, looking up things she couldn’t because of no data available for her internet browsing (so he’d screenshot it, or send her a PDF file of the information or documents she needed), or he would just listen when she needed to vent. Johne would talk to her about anything and everything. Even with her cramps, it didn’t matter, she could talk openly and honestly about whatever she felt like; and, he did the same, confiding in her. With him, she was comfortable, safe, and secure. He was there so long, never questioning her or judging, just being a good big brother.
After he was robbed, he was unable to get another phone or to a computer, she waited many months, but no word from him came. She didn’t understand at first, why it took him so long to get back online but then she knew: Johne was in trouble, she found that out later- not because of anything he had done- but because he had been betrayed by those around him, set up to be robbed. He did reach out to her around Easter, after the second wave of COVID, she’d received a communication in the form of an email file that had been passed across the globe for several weeks before reaching her. She saw it one day after logging into a local server, but marked it as spam, blocking him from sending another.
She could only imagine what that must have done to him.
Her bana had quickly moved in for the kill and asserted his husbandly opinions, for her to keep out of contact with Johne. “LeeryJean, it’s him or me!” He had spat in anger.
Her catholicism made the decision for her, leaving no question between choosing a husband over an adopted brother; but now, she was a widow, and her brother was somewhere out there in a dying world probably thinking she hated me. She’d never even said goodbye or told him why. Johne always lost those he loved due to misunderstandings. She had seen it so many times, so when she was led to believe he had wronged her, or done anything offensive, she should have known there was more to it. Instead of talking to him, she shut him out, and he was wrong.
She removed the block, but this email was somehow gone. Never read. Her so-called bana had the codes- something he’d insisted on in his jealousy- and deleting Johne’s email was not beneath him. She pondered that for weeks, before sending Johne a message in response to the email she never read; but so far, her message remained unopened. If only she had contacted him sooner, before the final wave of the Coronavirus. She was sure that he was still alive, and imagined him going somewhere like Mindanao, in Dipolog, making his way to Dapitan, and over to Casul. Would he visit Mount Malindang? Johne was still youthful, and in good health, her fellow pinays would adore him, and try to keep him. Did he go for his sister, only to find Leery was gone, and then give up- or was he out there somewhere, looking for her in what was left of the world?
When she was just seventeen, Leery had been befriended by an older girl named Vixanna. She had an American accent and claimed to actually be Aswang, but not an evil one, and that was why she had helped Leery. For some reason Leery’s thought went to that tall blonde. What had happened to her? Did she return to America, or was she still roaming the Philippines with her golden locks like beams of light from a lighthouse shining across a sea of brown? Whoever, or whatever, Vixanna was, she had seemed to have a strong interest in stopping the mistreatment of children. As if in some way she had been made protector of the youth, and had in fact protected many young lives. Saving them from other, less honorable Aswang. But, what life could any Aswang feed upon in a world full of death?
Would Vixanna find Johne?
Leery had seen so many mass graves: plain wood boxes, stacked three at a time, lined up in long rows that had been dug shallowly into the Earth by tired and shocked neighbors. Emptied vessels given back to the soil that had made them and all who came before them, to be returned and used for new life. Fertilizer. Life built from death, dependent upon its gifts. The epidemic fed on the world with its quota of bodies like an overdue bill collector returning the borrowed materials to its home. Johne once expressed to her that he was not afraid of death, but in fact welcomed the idea of it at times to release him from his existential torments- his survivor’s guilt- being the only one alive of his childhood friends, surviving so many tragedies and accidents. He felt that fate was keeping him alive, to bear witness, and contemplate what he had seen and experienced. Was he finally free? No more misunderstandings or broken hearts?
No. He was alive. She knew.
A metallic-like tapping echo came from down the hall, traveling through the walls, and with a sigh, Leery got up out of bed to go see what it was.
Death had swept through the lands calling many people back to the ground, but somehow, without knowing, she knew- that Johne was still among the living. She wondered what he would think of COVID Hill. Would he be creeped out by her choice of domain? Would he understand why she stayed?"

He took us to the library. He hugged the librarian like old friends do. She sat us at a long table and quickly returned with several books and some large bound volumes of newspaper clippings yellowed with age. Then we learned of the influenza pandemic from meanly a century before.
Familiar and entire neighborhoods were wiped out. And there in the old black and white photograph stood the chapel on the hill. People were laid out on the pews inside. This town didn’t have a real hospital back then. Just a little one that was soon overwhelmed. Churches, schools, and even barns became makeshift care centers, trying to attend to the sick and dying.
Pappy pointed out a skinny young man wearing overalls, holding a shovel in a faded photograph. A priest and another old man stood next to a coffin on a wagon. He wiped a tear from his eye and said “They even started holding Sunday service outside because nobody wanted to go back inside”.
Pappy was never one to be idle. He taught us to live, love, laugh. He would always say, “There’s nothing new under the sun. What was once, will be again”. His headstone is one of the easiest to find. It’s got his old manual push mower beside it. The old chapel still sets empty. There’s several newer churches in town. But I still like to go out there and pray."

I didn't hear the usual moans and screeches of the aging prison. No meals were delivered but without a clock I had no way of knowing the actual time. It was only when two full days and nights had passed without so much as a door opening and the strange putrid scent beginning to permeate my cell that I knew something was terribly and irreversibly wrong.
It took another two days to escape my cell, but fear and hunger are powerful forces. I found my fellow inmates and guards at various stages of decomposition. The disease ravages the arteries causing massive heart attacks and almost instantaneous death – and that way it is merciful. I found my best friend still in his bunk having slept through his own death; others were not so fortunate.
I've moved into the warden's residents - the house on the hill – an old, sad and lonely edifice that used to be the town chapel before the island was bought by the Norwegian government and transformed into a minimum-security open-plan re-entry facility and compound. Although spacious, open and airy it still holds a certain quaintness that makes me feel at ease, as if the saints and spirits once worshipped here continue to watch over the sacred remains. I have long buried or burned (when I became too tired to dig) my fellow islanders and have given up hope of finding any other survivors or of ever being rescued. I'm sure penal islands full of rapists and murderers are not on anyone's priority list. My daily routines are relegated to acts of survival;  foraging for food, chopping wood for heat and cooking, and reading books to pass the time. I have accepted my fate. I will live out my days here alone.
It has been two years since I escaped my cell and not a day goes by I don't regret it. Why did God allow me to live? Is this some form of cruel cosmic joke I don't yet understand? There is no food left on the island and the fish have moved on to warmer climates. My efforts to build a boat of some kind have all failed with almost fatal consequences. There are no more books to read and past memories of loved ones have erased their faces - I can no longer remember a time before being left alone. My mind, my new prison, argues and reasons with me to end my misery, but I am a coward. Every night I fall asleep with the hopes it will be my last and every morning I wake up to the nightmare that is my reality.
I wake up to the thump-thump-thump sound which I imagine are hunger-pain headaches. They're getting louder; closer. I dare allow myself a hint of hope as I run outside in nothing but socks and underwear and there it is, in all its glory, a beautiful green helicopter with a bright red and white cross. As I wave my arms furiously I shout and run after them. They see me. I drop to my knees and begin to weep. I cannot hold the tears back – tears that have been locked in a secret chamber of my heart now free to spill on my face. My life was over. I was in many real ways dead and buried, but today I have been resurrected. Today, my life begins anew."

Two-weeks of nothing but pure venture. I really wanted nothing more than to visit the church and see the headstones for myself. When we landed the sky was cloudy and a little rain was falling.
The cottage was nice and seemed like the period I heard so much about. I would visit the cemetery later the next day. I found myself relaxing on the bed which felt comfortable and soon was sound asleep. When I woke later that evening I was feeling a little hungry. Venturing outside and to get a breath of fresh air. I found a small tavern which sold ale. When I stepped through the door, it felt like I had been there before. I walked over to the little bar that was really small. A voice greeted me: “ what will you have Laddy?” Before I could think I said “ Brandy will do it.” When he brought it to me, I paid for it and thanked him. I turned and noticed all the people were standing holding their drinks up in the air. Before it could touch my lips, I sat it down. Realizing I don’t drink alcohol.
Pictures lined the wall and as I slowly walked toward them, I had seen some of these before. My eyes couldn’t lie to me. Not only was my father there and his father’s father. The entire O’Leary generation was hanging in a circle as if I didn’t know better. In the center was the church in all her glory.
I turned and wiped tears from my eyes because I had seen and rubbed trembling fingers over each one. One of the men handed the Brandy I had just bought and I raised my glass to the ceiling. Others did the same and one older man said I finally got to meet an O’Leary before I passed away. I tossed the Brandy down the back of my mouth. It burned like the Dickens. I felt hands slapping my back as I gasped for air. For once I felt as if I belonged. I was finally home for good."

My grandfather was a bootlegger, my great great grandfather was a smuggler.
I tried to develop a thesis that church attendance increased in times of prosperity and fell off when times were hard. That idea didn’t go far. Today, unemployment is below two per cent, but the church will have empty pews even on Palm Sunday!
Is it possible that church attendance correlates with poverty? I crunched some more numbers. I found better correlation but still not a satisfactory set. The best my AI engine could come up with was a complex and counterintuitive relationship that would go something like this: in bad times, people go to church, praise God and confess their sins. Their problems quickly finish. And good times, people work hard, erect monuments and read self-help books, but problems quickly develop.
How could that be? My dad, a self-made tech millionaire, says the answer is obvious and points to his Bible. My teachers at school said that book was outdated, sexist, racist and violent. We weren't allowed to read it. Maybe I'll check it out though, if anyone ever comes out with a good Bible app for my Obama phone."

“Should we knock?” Mike asked as we stood in front of the formidable wooden door.
The place was deathly quiet. Kenneth, eager to prove how brave he was, reached out and rapped three quick times on the door. The sound echoed into the house, and we listened with held breath. No answer came. “Thank god,” I said as my heart skipped and flipped.
“Looks like no one’s home,” Adam whispered.
Just then, the door cracked open. The darkness that lay inside that house seemed alive. The door was slowly being opened. No light, only darkness. And it moved. Then the darkness began to whisper… “Come in.”
I was backing away even as Kenneth was moving forward. Then Adam was taking a step toward the sound of the darkness. “Come on in,” the house coaxed… the dark became darker somehow. Then Mike was moving as if in a trance.
“Guys, stop!” I looked at the door as it slowly revealed more and more of the darkness that laid within its threshold.
I pulled at my friends’ clothing, I tore Adam’s shirt. Kenneth was entering the house, crossing into the void. The darkness seemed to gain pleasure from him. “STOP KENNETH! Don’t go in there!” I yelled while holding Adam. Then he was gone. Mike followed him in. I tried to hold Adam, but he was stronger than me and impatient to go.
I ran, my heart exploding. The car was where the police found me the next morning. Apparently I called them.

“They know because they hear her howling late at night.” Grandpa slid a sideways glance to see if the children were listening, and they were, so he continued.
“Some people say it’s nothing more than tall-tales, but nobody had been brave enough to move into the place since then. Now Grandma and me, we ain’t believing in these stories, so we moved in and we are still here.”
“Have you heard the girl howling?” Cheryl grinned as she rolled her blue eyes.
“Yes. But only once so far. But the story goes that the girl will transform into a beast after she howls but she is afraid to enter into the master bedroom. Nobody knows why, she just won’t enter so that tells me that Grandma and me is safe as long as we sleep in the master bedroom. The girl only turns into a beast late at night. Usually around ten o’clock, or shortly after.
“It all started one evening when Cheryl was real hungry and her dad had made her go to bed without her supper cause she had snuck into the kitchen before supper and stole a piece of her mother’s pie that was for the church. Well… after her parents were fast asleep, Cheryl snuck into the kitchen again but was afraid to turn on the light. So she grabbed a small bad that was sitting beside the refrigerator and slinked back through the shadows of the hallway back to her room. Still afraid to turn on a light, she reached into the bad and retrieved a few morsels of food and ate them quickly. They tasted so nasty that she turned on her light anyway to see what she had eaten. It was fried dog food.”
“Dog food!” Cheryl interrupted. “How gross Grandpa!”
“Did she get sick and puke all over her bedroom?” Darren laughed.
“No she didn’t get sick and puke, but she suddenly felt like something was changing.” Grandpa paused for effect.
“What was it?” Cheryl inquired.
“The girl noticed that her short finger nails were growing into long black claws. She felt her face growing as well so she turned on her light and looked in her mirror. To her horror, her nose and mouth had sprung out and looked like the snout of a coyote. She opened her snout and saw that her teeth had turned yellow and had grown into long fangs. Her stomach growled with hunger. Darren had awakened and heard the low growling coming from his sister’s room. Then he heard her door squeak open and the long claws scraping down the wooden floor of the dark hallway.” Grandpa paused again. Cheryl and Darren’s eyes were glued to the house in the open field. Grandpa continued.
“Darren was so afraid he snuck out his bedroom window and slunk down the side of the haunted house in a low crouch. When he was under the kitchen window, he thought he heard his mother’s voice telling Cheryl to go back to bed. Then he heard the growling and ripping sounds coming out of the kitchen window. Too afraid to stand up and look, he let his eyes roam up the rocky wall and settle on the wooden windowsill. That’s when he saw the golden-blonde hair shaking wildly to the left and to the right. His eyes jumped back down into their sockets as he imagined his mother’s body being ripped up to smithereens. Blood and guts flying all over the kitchen walls and ceiling. Then an awful, scary silence fell across the shadows of night.
“Then the silence was broken as Darren heard the long black claws scraping towards the living room where he knew his dad was probably fast asleep in his recliner with the newspaper spread out over his chest. Darren slunk down to the living room window and remained still and quiet. The low growl of the half-girl, half-beast was slowly ripping something apart. Darren imagined more blood and guts flying all over the living room. He raced to the wooden steps of the spiral staircase that lead to the top of the bell-tower. Darren clambered up the steps and reached the bell-tower, which was pitch back except for one sliver of moonlight streaking toward the inky black corner where he decided to hide from the beast.
In the eerie silence of the murky shadows, Darren heard the soft scraping of the long black claws crawling slowly upwards. He closed his eyes in belief that if he couldn’t see the beast, the beast couldn’t see him. But then he trembled with agonizing fear as the beast growled in what sounded like perfect english. ‘Get up!’ The beast growled again. Darren slowly opened his eyes as the beast growled once more. ‘Get up! Mom says you’re going to be late for school your first day!’ That’s when Darren realized that it was his own sister that was the beast.” Grandpa stopped and stared at his grandchildren.
“Oh grandpa! You made all that up trying to scare me,” Cheryl laughed.
“We don’t scare that easy grandpa,” Darren giggled.
“Well, your dad’s the one that said you turn into a beast when you don’t get enough to eat,” Grandpa and Darren laughed.
Later that night, Cheryl lay in her own bedroom watching the shadows dance across the walls while Darren lay wide awake in his own room listening for any growling sounds in the murky shadows. At 10:15 pm, the lone coyote howled at the moon and Grandpa smiled while Grandma Gretta read her book. To her amazement, two grandchildren barreled through the master bedroom door, leaped through the air and landed between her and Henry. The two children slinked under the covers and snuggled up against both Grandpa and Grandma’s sides.
“What in the world is the matter with you two?” Grandma asked.
“Grandpa told us the story of this house,” Cheryl silently grinned.
“How this house became haunted!” Darren grinned silently back towards Cheryl.
“Henry! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, scaring your own grandchildren.”
“What?” Henry yelped with a wry smile. “It was just a story!”
Cheryl and Darren snickered under the covers. Grandpa was in trouble again for telling his stories. What neither one had ever confessed to Grandma Gretta was the fact that they merely used Grandpa’s stories as an excuse to sleep with them when they came to visit.
Ah, the precious memories of Grandpa’s stories!"

Then it was relegated to the work shirt wardrobe. It endured for a while in this role, but eventually time and wear began to show.
It was relegated to the yard shirt pile, suitable for scrapping metal, yard work and automobile repair. I still maintained a reverence for my shirt. We’d had so many good memories.
After so many years of service it was getting thin. So it was demoted to the pile reserved for fish cleaning clothes. Part of my living is earned by commercial fishing. The processing of fish is a dirty, bloody, smelly activity, so for shirts and pants it’s the last leg. The clothes ain’t allowed inside. After a wash they’re hung on the back porch to air.
I was still very fond of my shirt. I actually saved it from the trash can three times when my wife tried to discard it. I’m not one to give up on a garment, especially one with such fond memories.
But the day came when it was time to admit the shirt’s time was done. While at the fish house I snagged it on a nail, ripped a large gash across the back. And it was very thin after so much wear and bleach. It was a painful choice, but it had to be done.
I took it home, called my wife and let her watch me throw it in the trash. She had a good laugh, me not so much. It was sorta like losing a good friend."

The Old Testament associates expensive clothes with sin, iniquity, pride and hypocrisy. Even in the first century in Palestine, where the Greek gymnasium was a controversial and volatile subject, a farm laborer or gardener on a warm sunny day was expected to be naked. The Lord Himself got up from the table, took off his clothes, and washed the apostles’ feet.
The funniest story in the Bible is about some high-ranking Isrealites who ran into trouble among their heathen neighbors. They sent word to the king that the enemy had shaved their beards and cut the hems off their garments. They were told to stay where they were until their beards grew back. The exposure of their private parts was regarded as a trivial matter, not worthy of further discussion.
Adam and Eve made the first clothes right after they betrayed their creator. Their fig leaf garments were like the grass skirts popularized by Hawa’iian missionaries. Imagine the agony in Heaven when God killed some of his beloved creatures, skinned them, and covered Adam and Eve with their blood!
The world has never been the same."

I watched the clock with dread as it mercilessly ticked down. I was scared. I didn't know how to fight. Stupid jeans! I thought.
I kept to the same routine as I walked home with my friends Van and Vernon. They were the only black kids in my grade and twins, and as such, were outcasts like me. A block from my house I could see a small crowd of kids had gathered; Ricky was pacing, smiling at me - I could read his thoughts. Mine would be the easiest ass he ever kicked.
Survival instincts kicked in and I ran like hell. Van and Vernon tried to hold Ricky back (God bless’em!) but him and his crew broke through and gave Chase. I ran with the speed of a gazelle in the savanna and busted through my kitchen door out of breath and terrified.
My sister took one look at me and calmly got up from her chair, crossed the kitchen, grabbed a large butcher knife and walked out the door. I could hear her screaming, daring them, threatening to chop their baby nuts off. I was still in shock, still laying on the floor heaving when she walked back in, put the knife away, and went back to her homework. She never said a word. Neither did I, but at that moment I realized my sister was a badass.
I don't remember if I ever wear those jeans again, I think I did. Ricky was still a bully, that wouldn't change for a few years, when girls became the new priority. But he never chased me home again. I would eventually grow into my ears and braces fixed my teeth, but inside I still felt like that scared gazelle. But in one way or another my sister would always be there to save me and that started to give me a new sense of confidence.
My sister and I would grow close and then grow apart over the next couple of decades. Our relationship was episodic like that. But I always held on to the belief that besides our parents, she was my greatest protector. The fierce mama bear ready to protect her cubs against all enemies – and she has.
Dedicated to my sister Antonia... For everything. Thank you for being my sister."

Whether it’s a pair of sweats sitting at home, or a polo shirt while you’re at work or just out and about, you want to feel good about your choice of what you wear.
Yes, I’m serious. We all have comfort foods that uplift us emotionally, so it stands to reason that we have clothing that does the same.
For me, it’s a little bit of the Alex Rogan look (see The Last Starfighter movie). The white t shirt with an open flannel shirt, my jeans and boots. When I want to look nice then I change into a Western style shirt. I’ll ditch my usual ball cap for my felt cowboy hat.
Naturally, in the warmer months I’ll wear shorts with my t shirt/flannel combo. Now these are mostly my casual daily choices. I tend to keep a few polo style shirts for more casual-yet-stylish occasions. Or for when a higher-casual standard is needed.
As I said earlier, our choices can also reflect our moods. When we are upbeat and happy we ten towards brighter colors and flashier styles. We want to show that we feel good, are having fun, and want to share this with those around us. When we are down, upset or even depressed, our color choices may trend towards bland or darker colors to reflect these heavier feelings.
So you see, our clothes don’t make us. They just reflect us and represent us. They show the world around us who we are and how we feel."

The truth is, the only way out is through. When we resist what’s already moved inside us, we intensify all the difficult feelings by trapping what we resist in our tension.
The only way we can mitigate these feelings is to let the experience of being human move on through. For the most part, walls are useless. It’s meeting the sensations of being alive that cleanses us and shapes us, the way fast currents scour the bottom of a river, making the river stronger.
We need to be porous, so that other lives can reach us and fill us. This means we have to learn to neither shut ourselves down nor give ourselves away. Whether we lived behind walls of our own making or put down our armor depends on how we close and open. We close when we’re hurt or afraid. Open when pain goes away or we’re held and loved back into life. Closing and opening are both necessary, like inhaling and exhaling. Day by day, we’re called to stay open to the life of feeling while not letting pain, fear and worry shut down our heart. When we stop opening our soul to the world, we become burdened.
When closing makes us insular, we tighten and miss the depth in everything. We start to become wall-builders. We start to hammer our armor into place. This is the cost of closing without opening. When we can open into what feels real and true, especially after great fear or pain, our hearts widen like inlets and we ready ourselves for grace, however it might appear. These rhythms of closing and opening are constant. Staying in relationship to both is a constant struggle in which we’re asked to trust our own experiences while listening to the truths of others."

About my towel and that tag… I’m sorry I couldn’t find that and send it too. But it was straight from Afghanistan, and I’m not trying to bullshit you!
So? What’s a man to do when prison is contrary to the news? And this is just my clothes! Wait till next month, when I tell you about my food (and my shoes)! Why, one’s from China and the other is from Vietnam! And nobody believes me - worst of all? My mom!"

Now I just wanted to go home.
I was slapped back to reality when two cops approached, and one of them put his hand on my shoulder. The outspoken one said, “Hey buddy, you are going to have to go back to jail with the prisoners to get your clothes. We can’t let you leave here in a county jail jumpsuit.”
Without the slightest hesitation, I unbuttoned the orange jumpsuit and stepped out of it wearing just my socks, sneakers and t-shirt. As I slipped my sneakers back on, I handed the jumper to the shocked, red-faced guard. He didn’t say anything.
Everyone in the courtroom was flabbergasted. They say it is always the things you least expect. I proceeded to walk out of court that day and nobody stopped me.
I hopped in the front seat of mom’s car and we went home. She told me she loved me, but I was crazy. I miss my mom.
The moral of the story is: Northing, especially not some stupid clothes, should keep us in jail a moment longer than we have to be. Thanks."

Frustrated with all of the illogical and contradictory policies and regulations that I had to plod through everyday, I decided to challenge it in court. At the time, I had zero experience with civil litigation or constitutional law. But I had read a case, where prisoners in California had been successful in challenging a similar mailroom regulation. So I had a little bit of confidence, although I had no idea what I was doing.
I filed the lawsuit, and within a few months, my First Amendment constitutional claim was dismissed at the district court level. Unwavering in my confidence, I filed an appeal in the 7th Circuit’s federal court of appeals. I read everything I could that would help me on how to better prepare my case for the higher court.
One of the things I need, which stuck out to me, was that the best legal arguments evoke a basic sense of fairness, decency and harmony. The law, as intended, is designed to maintain a delicate balance of order. Because disorder leads to chaos. And chaos upsets the status quo and disrupts the stability of those in power. So the trick for me, in crafting my legal argument, was to show how prison staff were being unreasonable and illogical in balancing the exercise of their authority against my fundamental right to communicate with the outside world.
In representing the prison administrators, the state Attorney General’s office argued to the court that the prison mailroom was justified in rejecting the email print-outs because we, the prisoner, could defraud and deceive the public if we were allowed such means to establish pen pal connections with people who lived beyond these walls. My counter-argument was, first, the prison staff had failed to introduce any evidence that I or other prisoners in the facility were using the emails to defraud the public; and second, I pointed to the fact that we were still allowed to communicate via snail mail with people who visited the pen pal site. So it was unreasonable to reject print-outs of emails when snail mail pen pal correspondence was still permitted.
Ultimately, the 7th Circuit court agreed with me. They reversed the dismissal and remanded the case back down to the district court. A week later, the Department of Corrections’ head Security Chief issued a memo to all Wisconsin prison mailrooms instructing them to allow inmates to receive print-outs of email messages from personal web pages and pen pal sites. Through a clear, balanced, well-reasoned legal argument, I was able to protect one of my most basic rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and keep all lines of the communication open with the outside world."

There I was, talking about this semester’s writing assignments - word themes and photo prompts - while all of a sudden there was the familiar sound of men (?) in disagreement. Ego versus ego! The self-absorbed against the narcissistic, the vain, and the boastful. Boys on the playground, but in this past Friday’s case it was juveniles pretending to be musicians and taking on the customs of the perceived performer. Luckily no instruments were smashed: only a busted lip and a cracked ego.
It could have went worse.
Many here (too many to count) die because of bruised egos. Retaliation is often the next unfortunate step: a busted lip can sometimes demand a punctured lung or liver within the habits of some prisoners. Those of the old - school institutionalized mentality, unable to evolve beyond pride.
Letting someone else win an argument, doesn’t mean they won per se: sometimes, it just means the unwanted conversation is over, and the other person goes on their way to annoy someone else. If there is anything of value I have learned here, it is that some people just aren’t worth talking to (they’re not worth the time) and it’s best to let them keep thinking what they speculate as truth. If you’re going to argue - pick your conflicts wisely - because not all debates (heated or otherwise) are created equal, and most are a waste of time.

Sound arguments are essential to effective communications.
First, the thesis must be clearly stated. Antagonists frequently put opposing spins on the issue even before presenting any relevant arguments. Liberals are known for restating issues and appealing to emotions rather than logic. This dishonorable tactic is often effective if the target audience is sufficiently egocentric and gullible. It has worked well in the abortion debate, in which intelligent people focus on the real issues of an innocent human being’s right to life and the duy of adult to protect defenseless people; liberals reframe the issue and rail about the tangential (how is this even relevant?) issue of a woman’s “right to choose.”
Then, carefully chosen facts must be stated. Theories, opinions, and suggestions are OK if they’re mutually agreed upon. A common error is to assume common ethical values. When I was struggling to get away from Tabor C.I., a common response to my request and complaints was that TCI was the safest prison in the State. Our enemies cited no reliable study in the support of that dubious proposition, but the major problem was the underlying assumption that I valued “safety”. What I want is for guards to mind their own business and leave me alone.
Finally, the proponent must show how the proven or agreed facts support his thesis. Avoid non sequitors and other sophisms. Direct proof is best but often proof by exclusion of the antithesis is more readily attainable:
A or B; not (A and B)
∴ A ↔ B̅; B ↔ A̅
∴ A
Prior to my arrest, almost all my writing was in support of notification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the human right of a baby to the care, nurture, and protection of his parents. The D.A. was working on behalf of a prostitute and a good ol’boy-veteran child pornography producer. He argued that three children should be tortured for fun and profit, and their protective parent (me) should be locked up. Predictably, the jury agreed with me; I was acquitted of three out of three charges.
So why am I in prison? In an argument, no matter how much evidence a poor boy has or how sound his logic or how convincing his argument, nothing speaks louder than money."

To deny that the racial identity of America as the Celto-Germanic Stock of Europe is equivalent to denying the racial identity of Mexico as a mixture of indigenous Meso-Americans and their Spanish conquerors.
The question is this: If within the next decade there are Mass Migrations of, let’s say, Syrians and Ethiopians into Mexico, for example, would the country then need deny its cultural and racial origins to accommodate the newly settled migrants? Could we call these people Mexican, and if so, is there a difference between the national and racial identity of Mexico’s Mestizo and non-Mestizo constituants? We should certainly think so. We do not suggest that these new citizens are not equal to their countrymen. Nor should their Non-Mestizo make up bump them to a second class status. We merely make the point to illustrate a distinction.
Some might ask “What about those who serve their country, militarily or otherwise, who are not of so-called American blood?” To this we say that those who serve their country are the first to deserve its liberties; but that does not negate our point. The disconnect is that America is no longer a racially homogeneous nation. The history of our democracy is offensive to certain members of our society. The idea of a white America brings to mind segregation and the promotion of racial superiority as a pass to exploit slave labor.
Yet, we must remember that historically man has always been tribal and subject to the ideas of his era; no matter how radical. Every conquering nation at one time or another has justified their conquest from a point of superiority (racial, religious, political, etc.). We denounce colonization and America’s early role in the slave trade, yet we are silent about the imperial ambition of the Ashanti who conquered neighboring tribes and sold them to Whites for gunpowder.
The difference in subjugating a neighboring tribe and an alien people half a world away is technological advancement. Nothing more. There is no moral high ground here.
We deny White America in her history because it does not represent the diversity that it does today. We fear that in recognizing the root of an American proper would be to denote non-Caucasian constituents to second class status, which is nonsense. Therefore, we disenfranchise the White American in his history.
It is not racist for Whites to be proud of their American heritage and their ancestors’ role in creating our nation. When foreigners immigrate to America, we are to respect their history, heritage, and religion. This is called integrity. We, as Americans, deserve that same respect."

He had to meet her. To talk to her. To find out who or what she really was. After working overtime, late at night, he went up to the roof of the building. Cautiously, he stepped up onto the ledge. Forty stories high. He knew this was crazy, but it made sense in his mind. His heart was beating double-time in his throat. His stomach was tighten-ing itself into a ball of tiny knots. Just don’t look down, he reminded himself. And then he lurched himself off the ledge into the open dark sky below. Before he could descend a few millimeters, from behind him a hand reached out, grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back onto the roof.
“David, what are you doing?” He knew it was her voice - soft, yet stern - before he turned around to look at her.
“I… I had… I just had to meet you,” David stammered as he regained his footing. Through her veil, he could still see her bright amber eyes sparkle in the calm darkness of the night. She eyed him for a moment then spoke calm and forcefully,
“You’re not supposed to be able to see me. For it is not written in the timeline.” Her scarlet red and burgundy wings flexed, extending then contracting.
“I've been dreaming about you for years,” David explained. “Ever since you saved me in that pool.

Moments later, they all load the plane to leave. George looks back one more time to wave to his family. His kids are standing in the saluting position. He salutes them back and loads up. As they arrive at their destination, everyone is splitting up in the branches. He got recruited by the Air Force, along with 300 other soldiers. Every day, he would write home, letting his family know how things are; knowing that he is in the air 75% of the time, fighting. On every holiday, he would call home and speak to his family: he tries to fight back his tears when he talks to them, especially when he hears his kids say,
“Daddy when are you coming home? We miss you and love you.” He tells them that he doesn’t know.
“We are constantly fighting. We don’t know how long it’s going to last.”
On December 25, 1943, while Edna and Cleveland are opening their Christmas present and Juanette is in the kitchen washing dishes, they hear a knock on the door. Thinking it’s some family coming with more presents for the kids, Edna goes to the door and opens it. As she opens it, Juanette is coming out of the kitchen with her towel in her hand. She asks who it is. Edna doesn’t speak. She just runs to her mother, tears in her eyes. Her mother asks,
“What is wrong?” As she gets closer to the door, she notices two soldiers are standing on the front porch asking for Mrs. Smith. Juanette says,
“That’s me. Can I help you two find gentlemen?”. They hand her Mr. Smith’s air force hat and she breaks into a sob as she realizes what has just happened. The soldiers are still standing in the doorway trying to comfort Mrs. Smith as other relatives pull up to the driveway. At once, they notice the army vehicle and they start rushing to the door expecting to see George. As they get to the door, they hear Juanette crying and also notice two soldiers standing there. Two months later, at the funeral, they played the song “American Soldier” by Toby Keith with other soldiers at the funeral."

Nora had a hard time looking at her. Mother just smiled and shooed me to the parlor. I wandered back and knelt on the prié dieu at the casket. Gazing at Helen’s face, I understood what upset Nora. Helen looked pale and … well … yellow. Not her normal tan and rose complexion. What would Helen think of all the drama over makeup? In life she only wore plain lip balm.
Corpses in open caskets are beyond grotesque. Relatives and friends were saying “Doesn’t she look natural? Couldn’t she just sit up and talk to you?” I looked at Helen’s hands loosely clasped at her waist and reached inside. Her hand was cold and rubbery. Brother Revel’s voice floated in from the front yard where an impromptu prayer meeting under the spreading oak was commencing. He boomed out how the dead would rise in the flesh and Helen could leap out of the casket.
At that moment, I couldn’t move my hand. Cold air blowing from the window unit seemed eerily freezing. I prayed hard. “Please don’t sit up, Helen, please don’t get out of the casket.”
Mother entered behind me with a tube of Rose Blush lipstick in hand. She assessed the situation and reached over to clasp my hand in her sweaty hot living flesh. Mother pulled my hand out of the coffin and told me to scoot to the backyard.
At the funeral, I dutifull appeared at church for the funeral but wouldn’t get into a car for the ride to the cemetery. Instead, I wedged myself firmly into the station wagon with the rest of the babies for a trip to the Dairy Air.

Cliona would not grow up to follow her abusive mother into illusion. Instead, she would create a better life. One without lies; without years of men and women coming and going from the family home, and mother’s bed; pregnancies aborted followed by unearned justifications. The fictional world of the mother would not continually contaminate Cliona. She had now seen her father, and years of suspicions were being confirmed: her mother had lied about him. Lied about why he was gone, why he was locked away, and she was keeping Cliona from living the life she was meant to have.
The mother did everything conceivable to erase the father, Donal, from existence, keeping not only his physical body locked away out of their daughter’s life - but any reference to him, his family, friends, or life whatsoever. At any cost, it was a decision she held to adamantly, and to her daughter’s psychological expense. Not even Cliona’s other siblings, nieces, and nephews were allowed in her life. Sadly Vixanna knew victims of domestic violence experience depression and other psychological distress, eating disorders, and can be vulnerable to alcohol and substance abuse problems, and they are more likely than other people to contemplate or attempt suicide.
There was a younger child - a toddler named Shaquia - present, who had witnessed the abuse, and as expected, the mother lied to judges and officers on numerous occasions to convulate that fact. Children who merely witness domestic violence experience depression and psychological distress and are more likely than other children to be physically violent. The toddler was, so far, a life-long witness. The mother was trying to direct the fight away from her, but as before, failed.
Cliona would not be a victim anymore. The truth sat waiting in time long enough. Vixanna’s predecessor had planted a seed for truth to grow in Cliona’s mind. Simple to do, since she already knew in her heart, that something was not right with her mother’s stories. None of Vixanna’s kind approved of the mother or the mother’s kind - but, it was not their place to punish her - they were there only to save Cliona, and possibly Shaquia from her. To see that Cliona knew her past, and grew to reach her full potential. Vixanna did not believe Cliona ever had it in her to conform as the mother had, to trade individuality for tribal affiliations and inclusion. To trade the modern atomic family structure for a lived out bad episode of Jerry Springer. Because of what? Ego? Not wanting to admit the father had been right all along? Why the mother refused to acknowledge her own psychological problems, and continually chose to fail, was her of her own consequence. And she was paying its price daily.
Cliona had sat, waiting in time, to stand up to her mother, and Vixanna would make sure that it was not in vain. A decade and a half of lies were at their close, with the Era of Mother giving away for true growth to begin. She still loved her mother, as any good daughter would, but she would not become her mother. She would mature beyond the mother’s comprehension, adding to societal advancement - not its Springeresque entertainment. Cliona would not be a novelty or trophy. She would become a woman of style, prestige, and intellectual prowess. Things the mother feared.
Vixanna remained outside the home, sensing the mother’s plans, what she was going to tell the responding officer, the lies she devised for her DSS file, and still in those thoughts, she was compiling the list for her boy toy’s replacement, an assortment of genders and races, people she knew would eagerly jump in to replace him in her bed - knowing her would only stay if desperate. The mother knew she was a Springer Rescue novelty for him, he would soon lose interest, and replace her easily. Looking at her and thinking just as each before him: Been there, done that.
Vixanna reached deeper into the mental maze - a curiosity - and found the mother did have the faculty for empathy, and the introspection needed to change, to grow into a better woman; but she had chosen the easier path. The one that helped her forget. The one that required less effort. And Vixanna felt something hidden, that made her own heartstrings vibrate: the mother’s nearly two decade line of miscellaneous lovers was merely to fill a lifelong void in her own soul. That’s why she’d betrayed any to trust her, or that were faithful to her. The mother was not a villain per se, just another lost soul that had failed (or refused or rejected) to find its way. All the domestic violence towards Cliona: the verbal abuse, denial of access to resources or money, restraint of normal activities or freedom (including isolation from friends and family, especially any connections to the father, or even mention of the father himself), coercion or assault, threats to kill or to harm, and physical intimidation or attacks; were really refusals to accept accountability for her own life path. Keeping the truth hidden, kept her illusion alive.
As an emotionalist vampire, Vixanna was doomed to forever feel the ups and downs of humans and their experiences, for better and worse. Mostly worse. Yet, she would remain their protectorette, because it was those like Cliona and her father who made it all worth it…. Her cell phone vibrated, and when she looked it was Donal - calling as if on cue."

But for what purpose? I can’t bring myself to bring back any memories as her tears now have dried. Besides, it’s not my place to ask.
Wait, why am I following her? Have I now become a stalker. Wow, what a pathetic life I live. I do things without bothering to pay attention to how it might affect the lives around me, until it’s too late. Like now. I stop walking, and look up to the sky, not sure how to ask for help when I only do so when I get so low I can’t seem to manage on my own. But no matter, I mumble a plea to help me become more aware. For no one should have to endure a loss and live alone. If anyone knows this it’s me. We are not able to live alone with our pressing problems and the character defects which cause or aggravate them.
I have forced myself to live by myself with those tormenting ghosts of the past that continue to haunt me into my future. I have the knowledge, the ability, and fortitude to change. I just need the courage to stick with it. To better myself and to avoid any unneeded bad reactions that could potentially lead to even more widows such as she.

Then, there’s today. Today, He’ll come down stealthier avenues. Today, His price will be her freedom.
Everything He has touched, He has taken from her. As she stands there, dressed for an occasion of joy, she can only think of her grief. The mark He left burns deeper than it ever has in years. For that, more than anything else, she has chosen to wear black.
The day should have been marked white. It was her wedding day. As she stood in the small vestibule with her best friend dressed in her maid-of-honor dress, despite the cramped quarters of the small room, it felt way too empty.
He had taken the one thing that meant the world to her on this day before all others: her father. Two years ago, Death visited her father in his study as he read one of his new stories to her. She was always the first to hear them before others, a privilege she cherished to the very end. She felt Him even before the event. A cold chill that tiptoed up her legs till it settled into the back of her spine. It rode up the vertebrae into a crescendo when Dad collapsed mid-sentence. A stroke, the doctors said. A massive explosion inside the cranium of blood and synaptic energy. And somehow, she felt it all along with him as he died in her arms.
And now, the extent of that theft was felt inside these wooden walls of this tiny space. There would be no one to walk her down the aisle. There would be no one to raise her veil, kiss her cheek, and hand her off to the man who would be hers, and she his. A day when her singleness would enter its own form of death, there would be no father to mediate the transition.
There would be looks and questioning flames from the pews today. Of course there will be. They would wonder: would Death visit her again to see this new man, would her curse continue forth? She understood their rumor mongering - a natural human tendency feeding a deep need to attain clearer understanding. But, it didn’t mean she had to like it.
She wouldn’t let Death have this day any more than He already had. If she did, it would have her too.
A stamp of her foot in emphatic assertion of the silent statement was unsurprisingly followed by the start of “The Bridal March” from inside the abbey. It was time. She steeled herself, smoothed down the wrinkles that came about from fidgeting, and let Marsha lead the way. Life anew awaited ahead."

“Yes, High Matron.” Talia replied, but still uncertain how this interview might go.

Rising, Talia wasn’t sure what to say.  She’d never heard of anything but Sisters and Matrons, of various ranks.  “More than Sisters and Matrons, High Matron Uvas?”
“Yes,” the Matron smiled carefully.  “I shall provide you an introduction, and the Brand is placed… eh, elsewhere, let’s say,” Uvas cringed and touched at her left breast unconsciously.  “But you might find the Spiders to be quite a suitable match.”  Uvas guided Talia toward the entry to the temple.

How his children might feel, how his mother and girlfriend might feel. I asked him to think of a little thing that brings joy to him - a cup of coffee, a song. To consider that, even just thinking about how these things can be a salve to our sadness. And if that much could be better, it’s proof that things can be better, so it’s not hopeless.” My eyes are still betraying me - I can feel tears threatening to escape my lashes. The necklace chafes my collarbone.
“...Child…” They sigh gently. “Can you truly think to lie here? In this place? Please, be honest.”
So choked, the words are barely a whisper. “It was him.”
“Yes, which only made your task that much more important.”
“After what he did to Alexxa, to take this way out is better than he deserved.”
“So people who hurt our sisters, our family, they deserve to suffer?”
“Yes…”
“And what of the suffering we cause? Are any of us truly innocent? Have you not hurt someone? Have you not been the cause of suffering? Do you deserve to suffer, too?”
I can’t answer. I shrug. They sigh again.
“He did not recognize you.” Not a question, but I confirm with a shake of my head. “But you know him to be the man who raped and beat Alexxa, her ex-boyfriend, father of your nephew.”
Finally, I manage a croaked “Yes.”
So, when you were meant to lift his despair, to ease the suffering of a prisoner -- the same gift you received when you were a prisoner, let us remember -- you instead chose to prick his conscience, right?”
“Yes, High One.” They waited, and I knew I must explain more. “I brought up his family because I know they’ve disowned him. I brought up his children because I know he’s failed as a father, and his girlfriend because I know he’d been convicted for having beaten his last one to death. I mentioned these ‘small pleasures’ because I know he’d once been a lover of fine coffee and a failed musician…”
“So, what could seem to be encouragement to live, was actually calculated knife-twisting meant to push this man into the final act, yes?” They won’t let him off the hook after a mere confession. The High One must know I fully grasp my choice.
“...Yes, High One.” They shake their head.
“Aren’t we even having this conversation because you’d meant to model the … grace you once received?” They knew the answer already; this is rhetorical.
“Maybe I’m never going to make it to the place, High One. Maybe this is as good as I can be.”
“If that were true, child, I would not even be here, would not exist.” They put a finger under my chin, nudge me to look at them, focus on them. “You have potential, child. Perhaps you are only...unready. But you must grow, must...aspire to be ready. Yes?”
“Yes, High One.”
They nod, rise, and walk away. “You will become ready when you decide to be, child.”

That’s when I wake up with her name learning my mouth and tears in my eyes. The pain is real even though it wasn’t happening. The pain is the tears are, and regret is completely destroying me.
I may have been dreaming, don’t you think for a second though that it wasn’t real because, I for one truly believe every single moment of that was real. “Yes, it was only a dream...and yet, I cry.”"

This is what she wore to my wedding, for she’s my mother-in-law."

The sultan considered this and said, “So be it. Take my fastest horse and flee to Samara.”
The servant raced to the stables and rode away on the sultan's fastest horse.
The sultan sat and pondered the situation for some time. He could not have his servants racing off to the far corners of the world at random times. So he decided there was only one thing he could do–he would question Death himself.
So, he summoned his horseman to bring his most regal horse and gallantly trotted to the market.
Spotting her rather easily, the sultan hopped off of his horse and gave her a quick bow.
“Death?” he asked, “Why did you give my servant such a frightful look this morning? The poor man is terrified.”
“I apologize,” said Death. “I was surprised to see him here today as I have an appointment with him tomorrow in Samara.”"

Dead to me- is the virtue of my fellow man those myriad promises of teachers and clergy, whose ignorance fuels perpetual wars-the globe they span.
Dead to me- is my flag waving pride, the belief that we are better than them, an eternal lie. Elvis Presley sings his song on T.V. in military dress as bombs rain down in Vietnam, a man-made mess.

At first she roamed from couch to bed to shelter, Houston, Miami, Baltimore. Eventually she landed in Woodbridge, Virginia, a DC suburb, where she moved in with a girlfriend. At fifteen the girlfriend’s father drugged and raped her. Eve told the girlfriend; the father denied it. The family circled the wagons, pointed fingers at Eve, made all kinds of accusations and threats. Finally Eve dropped it and moved out. No chargers were ever filed, and she never forgot what the man had done to her.
In the years that followed Eve developed a feral restlessness. She seemed determined to find the darkest recess of life and embrace them as some kind of normal. She withdrew, began to cut herself, and dressed in black. She cultivated an array of sex partners, mostly men she picked up at drug dens. Add to that cauldron an ever-increasing measure of cocaine, heroin, and cheap liquor, a form of self-medication that quelled her inner scream but amplified the outer madness.
No one noticed, or maybe no one cared that Eve was burying a second husband within a five year period. The police, the insurance companies - no one questioned it. Their deaths were ruled as “natural causes,” and that was that.
Neither husband left at will. Probably because neither husband had anything of value to bequeath to anyone. There were, however, two insurance policies.
The first husband’s insurance policy was for half a million; the second was for two million. Two-point-five million dollars, and Eve was the sole beneficiary. With her pain now eased considerably she somehow managed to suffer through Jake’s funeral without a severe meltdown.
The insurance company stalled and balked as they always do, initially. But after her first husband, Eve was experienced, and prepared. After some calls and threats of lawsuits from her lawyer, a $200 an hour sleaze who had fine-tuned the practice of corruption into an art, they wrote the check.
A week later Eve was driving a new corvette. She and her latest boy-toy announced their plans to wed."

Whatever her situation, within every aspect of life, there was always something to learn. Along every road she travelled, or path she chose to take, she was always looking for the new lesson to learn, no matter the outcome, and with enthusiasm.
Needless to say, she became well travelled, discovering the beauty of the world in all forms that it held, and always meeting new and exciting people along the way.
Though not all of what she learned was pleasant, nor appealing, she was still thankful for the lessons’ guidance, the direction in life that it allowed her. However, not always seeing the good within the lesson learned at the time. Often it wasn’t until she got further down the road, or path, that she was on before she realized the value.
Along the way, she inevitably found that life and people could be cold, with no remorse for what they put a person through. This makes it unbearable for some, while this coldness is contagious to others.
She realized one day that this coldness can seep in and take seed within its victim, when she noticed a bitterness growing within herself, that most people wouldn’t catch. The bitterness attempting to settle in as a coldness toward others, as it had been towards her.
This being just one of the traps, or pitfalls, of life, her determination took hold, to overcome this bitterness, this coldness trying to install itself, and avoid any other possible threats. Thankful that she caught it in time, and for the armor to guard herself from it with, she vowed to always stay alert in the future, ready to defend against such things when they presented themselves. Lesson learned.
From this she found a new awareness, paying even more attention to the world around her, especially its people. She noticed that she wasn’t alone within this endeavor. She could now recognize the look in another’s’ eyes that told her of the struggle within, and whether or not they were succumbing to the constant assault.
At times this was heartbreaking to her, when she saw that someone was losing their battle. Always wanting so much to help, yet not knowing how. Being at a loss…
Dressed in black, she is mourning the loss of many things, from her life, as well as from within others’ lives. Yet, the pain that grips her is for others, for whom a new determination has arisen within her, to help them… her new direction."

“Yes,” he replied. “The last of his favorite dog food.”
“Then why are you still here?” Edna set her pocket book on the table, opened it, and happily fingered her new documents.
“I’ve got no place to go, I tried to call.” He started to cry. The last few days had been difficult. He couldn’t find his medicine.
“Pamela and I have some things to do. I don’t care where you go, but if you’re still here when I get back you’ll never see your children again!”
Edna freshened up in the bathroom, called her next door neighbor, waved through their windows, grabbed her pocket book, and strode excitedly to Pamela’s (and my) house.
Richard went outside and unfastened the hose. He took both ends to the car and prepared it for his final trip.
When Edna got home, her car was still in the driveway but it had been moved slightly. The engine was running. Richard was behind the wheel. His lips were blue; his eyes stared vacantly toward the house where a crippled boy lay soiled and crying.
The next ten days were hectic ones for the Widow Gregory–letters, phone calls, the funeral. The insurance company said Richard had committed suicide and denied her claim, but Edna had a thick file she’d prepared weeks ago, with bills from a psychologist medical records, VA documents, prescriptions. The kicker was the medicine bottle half full of pills when it should have been almost empty. It was obvious he’d been ill and not taken enough medicine, even though she’d remind him daily. Taking the advice of her lawyer, she’d paid extra for a double indemnity clause so the company finally paid her twice the face amount from the policy.
My wife rode with her to the bank. They stopped for drinks on the way home. (It wasn’t really on the way. They went out of town where they were sure the folks from church wouldn’t see them).
“How’s Robert?” Edna asked.
Pamela rolled her eyes.
“Nothing changes. He talks to the children about the Bible and fusses at me about the Bills.”
“He’s a tough one,” Edna sighed. “He may not kill himself, but we’ll get rid of him one way or another. Did you get the policy?”
“Just like you told me.” Pamela produced a thick folded document from her pocket book.
“Good!” Edna scanned the paperwork, paid the tab (no tip), and stood up. “Let’s get to work.”
Within four years, Pamela was a wealthy woman and I was in jail."

Only more suffering. Life went on. Worked hard everyday, and put the children through school. Focused my life on the children. Made them my purpose in life. I had to find something to live for and it was my family. They are the only real thing in this life. The only thing that is worth continuity.
The children of the family are the true treasures worth living for. They are my higher power. Everything I did was for them. Not for an obsolete literary construct.
Life is hard for everyone. In order to be truly free you must live for this present life and the future of those who will follow. Then you will be living for something real and worth following. Not because you are afraid of displeasing a nonexistent superbeing, but because this life allows you to choose what is right. Choosing freely to care for your family against all odds without the baggage of centuries of fear mongering theological tyrants. This is true freedom."

He had to meet her. To talk to her. To find out who or what she really was. After working overtime, late at night, he went up to the roof of the building. Cautiously, he stepped up onto th eledge. Forty stories high. He knew this was crazy, but it made sense in his mind. His heart beating double-time in his throat. His stomach tightening itself into a ball of tiny knots. Just don’t look down, he reminded himself. And then he lurched himself off the ledge into the open dark sky below. Before he could descend a few millimeters, from behind him a hand reached out, grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back onto the roof.
“David, what are you doing?” He knew it was her voice - soft, yet stern - before he turned around to look at her.
“I....I had....I just had to meet you,” David stammered as he regained his footing. Through her veil, he could still see her bright amber eyes sparkle in the calm darkness of the night.
She eyed him for a moment then spoke calmly and forcefully, “You’re not supposed to be able to see me. For it is not written in the timeline.” Her scarlet red and burgundy wings flexed, extending then contracting.
“I’ve been dreaming about you for years,” David explained. “Ever since you saved me in that pool.”
Just then, thunder rumbled through out the sky and branches of orange-white lightning crackled above the rolling gray storm clouds.
“The timeline is compromised,” she said, looking frantic towards the sky. “You are no longer safe on this planet, my King. We must return you to Altrozon.” She quickly hugged him around the chest and they both ascended high beyond the zenith of the sky."

Death can be sad and happy. Some people have parties at funerals. Some can last two days or a week. Some cultures bring food and burn money to send to another life. There are different kinds of grieving stress; anger, sadness, depression, hurt, alone and lost. It takes time to heal from the pain of your loss. We will never forget their memories, both good and bad. They are always in our hearts.

A simple smile could be the first-aid kit that someone has been looking for. If you believe with absolute honesty that you are doing everything you can - do more.
There will be bad days, times when the world weighs on you for so long it leaves you looking for an easy way out. There will be moments when the drought of joy seems unending. Instances spent pretending that everything is alright when it clearly is not, check your blind spot. See that love is still there, be patient. Every nightmare has a beginning, but every bad day has an end. Ignore what others have called you. I am calling you friend. Make us comprehend the urgency of your crisis. Silence left to its own devices, breed’s silence.
So speak and be heard. One word after the next, express yourself and put your life into context - if you find that no one is listening, be loud. Make noise. Stand in poise and be open. Hope in these situations is not enough and you will need someone to lean on. In the unlikely event that you have no one, look again. Everyone is blessed with the ability to listen. The deaf will hear you with their eyes. The blind will see you with their hands. Let your heart fill their newsstands, let them read all about it. Admit to the bad days, the impossible nights. Listen to the insights of those who have been there, but have come back. They’ll tell you; you can stack misery, you can pack despair, you can even wear your sorrow - but come tomorrow you must change your clothes.
Everyone knows pain. We are not meant to carry it forever. We were never meant to hold it so closely, so be certain in the belief that what pain belongs to now will belong soon to then. That when someone asks you how your day was, realize that for some of us - it’s the only way we know how to say, “Be calm. Loosen your grip, opening each palm, slowly now - let go.”"

I also noticed that when I did my best to make things better -- every now and then -- I would succeed… eventually. As I look around today I see a better life with a job, school, good housing unit, great cellmate, and even better food, not to mention the healthiest I’ve felt since my early 20’s. Writing has helped me see and appreciate my life in a whole new light.
See, writing was for me not a diversion. It was my church, because it offered salvation in the promise of change. Escaping Hell is difficult, because sometimes there are too many people who enjoy seeing you there. But with enough effort, once grace, and pens and paper, it can be done. When my parents wrote to tell me they were proud of me on my 40th birthday card, I wept. And I wept again after my niece’s and sister’s visit -- seeing them grown, changed, and beautiful from the inside out -- having found what they had been searching for (though not in the place they had been looking).
Writing, and specifically journaling, has taught me how to look forward once again to the next chapter and, finally, to my own life."

I thought I could do it, only now I’m looking at that mountain and all the forest we gotta cross to get to it, and I’m thinking that’s more nature than I need in my life right now.”
To be honest, I don’t think I was ever as fully committed to the outing as I had led Steev and the others to believe. “Roughing it,” as in purposely denying myself broadband and GrubHub delivery for a whole three days, held about as much appeal to me as hitting myself in the head with a hammer.
“Come on, O,” Roberto “Bert” Perez enetreated. “Like Steev said, we’re almost there. Stick it out with us, hermano.”
“Are you not seeing what I’m seeing, Bert?
It was beautiful out there, without a doubt. But everything was so … intimidating. Reaching right up into the underbelly of the clouds were massive stone shards of the earth itself. Even though we were still miles from it, that range of mountains was so ginormous I didn’t doubt i t had its own gravitational field. Our cabin was at the foot of that?
Between us and there, and beyond, the forest was an ocean of evergreen skyscrapers, a home to hordes of wild creatures that could fly and stalk and pounce with talons or claws or fangs. Google listed all the animals that were out there, but the only ones that I could remember were bears and cougars. They killed people. The others would eat whatever was left over. I’d been feeling hungry eyes on me ever since we first arrived.
And what about that sky? Overcast with cotton batting of purple and grey from horizon to horizon, keeping everything beneath it cold and damp. Every once in a while the wind blew a chill clean through me, every time convincing me one night without heat would be all it took to become an ice-cold corpse by morning.
Even that little stream. It probably started wa-a-ay up in those mountains somewhere, and was just itching to drown us all as soon as it could gather up enough snow melt to become a raging river.
It was Nature and it was not safe. This was what cities came from? It seemed impossible. I saw nothing tamable there. Nothing. The place literally been scaring the shit out of me from the minute we got there, because I’d been wanting to take a deuce since I climbed out of my car. And I was supposed to drop said deuce out here, how again?
“Look, I can’t speak for anybody else,” I explained, “but me, I came from a long line of city people. The last time somebody in my family saw something like that,” I waved a hand towards the view before us, “they probably wanted to know how much further it was to freedom.”
Steev said, “You mean to tell me, even after all that money you spent on gear and supplies, you’re really not gonna go through with it?”
I shook my head. “I’m really not.”
Steev said, “Well, if that’s how you feel, you can find your own way back okay, can’t you?”
If that sounded like anything other than him hoping I feel down an unmarked well on my way back to the cars, it wasn’t.
“No prob,” I assured him. “I’m good.”
“Then I guess we’ll see you at work Tuesday morning.”
I watched my friends skirt the creek’s edge on their way toward that majestic purple rock in the distance. No one turned around to catch my salute. It wasn’t for them anyways."

I came to a cognitive crossroad; Do I give into this depression? Cope by living in distraction, neglect my health, my hygeine, and slowly kill myself as so many of these guys do? Or, do I do something about this? Do I take it upon myself to learn the rules of their game, understand how they continue to get away with this, and how to combat it?
In this, I hope to inspire YOU.
It took me 8 months to learn how to read case law, statutes, and court rules. Grasp all that information and apply it in drafting a pro se appeal that is so good that my attorney needed to adapt it into his own brief. You can do this too!
This is how I did it: The most important step by far is to be kind and get to know people. Church worked best for me and I highly recommend it. You can learn from all the men who have actually worked their appeals. In this, you’ll get a lot of opinions, and it is paramount that you compare and contrast the information given to you, so get to know more than just a few people. Decipher their facts from opinions and see who is spiteful or delusional versus who is genuinely knowledgeable and helpful.
Throughout this process make law library appointments for a legal assistant like myself. We are very informed and will guide you through a step-by-step plan.
If you are wrongly convicted, or only partially guilty, or excessively sentenced; don’t let the possible stigma of your charges or the overall seeming complexities daunt you. Please do something.
If you are guilty or have exhausted your appeal options; please help those who are motivated.
I see so many people get new trials or sentence reductions when they put in the work. You can too."

And if you are one of the cynics that believe that “little” things in life are trivial, let me give you a bit of street wisdom: NOTHING is trivial. Ever. The moment you forget it, the moment you take the little things in life for granted, you lose them - sometimes irrevocably. It’s not until we lose what matters that we can truly appreciate just what we had.
This is what happened to me when I fell from graceful poverty to the abysmal bottom of the rock pit that is hopeless destitution. In prison. Alone. And forgotten...This may seem like I am taking the liberty to express a cliched, personal sob-story, but, let me assure you it’s relevant to the subject matter and I won’t keep you longer than necessary.
I was a teenage kid on the cusp of manhood when I got locked up for my first monumental mistake. I had no gifts, no talents, no job skills, and no areas of expertise-unless one can count a bad sense of humor, a love for weed, and a knack for finding myself in bedroom relations with women older than myself. And, while that was all very educational and fun, I’d forgotten that life was not simply a game of chance. I’d lost just about everyone I knew and loved in one day, the rest of my family and friends would abandon me within the following year. I literally lost all of my worldly possessions, I lost my spotless record and my freedom (along with any hopes or dreams of ever being a practicing M.D.) and I lost hope for anything but a quick death as a number in a steel cage. Yes, life was a rather bleak cesspool for me at the end of my teens; but I am a survivor by nature. It was instilled in me from birth to fight. To never give up, never back down, to claw for life and anything in it that is good. To salvage, scrimp and save. To find the positive in the negatives and believe that I could win out because I was freaking ten-feet-tall-and-bullet-proof...or...at least, capable of taking whatever cheap shots life took at me. That was what the little people in my life had seared into my very soul. Even when I wanted to do nothing more but the opposite, wallow in self-pity, lay down and die, I couldn’t. I was too damned stubborn.
As such, I got back up and dusted myself off, analyzed my new surroundings and built a broken boy into a solid man. It was harder than anything I’d ever conceived of doing; and it was also easier than I thought. Essentially, to change, to grow, you have to want it. No one will hand it to you, and - most often - no one is going to help you do it. The only people who return back to “their old ways'' are those who didn’t truly wish to leave them, simple as that. I learned quickly that everyone around you is an inspiration - they are the people you either want to be or would hate to be, they are all examples of what you could become given the dynamic of your decisions. Between the addicts that refuse to change and the self-taught artists that tackle their work with an ethic that would put professionals to shame, I picked the latter. Between those unchanging, self-deprecating men who flock to the comfort of numbers and gang colors in exchange for individuality, and the unique, strong-minded individual with his nose in a book and his mind on the future, the latter, again, appealed to me. I found that I could be inspired to do what was right rather than do what was convenient, to stand when standing was not easy, to walk on my own two feet and grow in spite of the crippling dehumanization of the prison system. I was inspired by other “criminals” (who are really just people who have made a mistake, like anyone else) rather than the studio-gangsters in Hollywood who had inspired them to become such. The little people the world forgot, rather than the stars that are blowing up social media, wreathed as they are in blinding light. In my ten years of incarceration, I taught myself to write better than a seventh grader (which is the most accurate description I could attribute to my penmanship when I graduated highschool) by reading. I taught myself math, well enough that it became my best subject in college, where it was once my worst subject as a child. By teaching myself, I cultivated a talent in art and book writing, through so much trial and error, irritating mistakes, and dogged determination. I am now good enough at both crafts to make a career of writing and illustration. I’ve completed two degrees, mastered two vocational trades, learned valuable job and leadership skills, discovered what true friends really are, and won the mental war against substance abuse and self-defeating deprications. All of this I’ve learned in the most negative of circumstances in the world. In my life, I have been staved child, a clown, a sex addict, a loser, a criminal, but so too have I been a student, a friend, a mentor, a teacher, a businessman, and--yes--even an inspiration to others around me. Just as you, my friend, whoever you are, are an unwitting inspirational influence to the people around you.
Everyone can teach us something if we’d only look hard enough: how to be, or how not to be.
Everything, big or small, can inspire us and move us on an intellectual and emotional scale: music, dance, art, movies, people, nature, science. From the sound of a typewriter, to the laugh of a child, to a breathtaking view of the unclimbed mountains that loom on the horizon, inspiration is in all things.
Remember that when you seek your next muse in whatever craft you practice with passion. Consider, when you feel lost, hopeless and numb, that there are others who have it worse than you and still fight on--Because life is worth fighting for. Inspiration can come from the most unlikely of places (I can’t say this enough) and is often not a thing that can be simply taught in words, but needs to be lived. It must be felt to have the true depth of its meaning understood. The mind must be set to tumbling into creative emotion, emotions stirred like a churning maelstrom in the twilight, whether you are living the high life or have found yourself in that familiar terrain known as “rock bottom”. And if you are of the latter, my friend, let me assure you that: once you’re at the bottom of the barrel, the only place you have left to go...is up; but, that all begins with you getting up and trying again. Life isn’t over until it’s over/ There are positives hidden in the negatives, narrow pathways that lead up rather than spiral down, but you have to seek them. You have to stand for them, believe in them, fight for a change, and prove to others--to yourself--that it can be done.
So I ask you again: where does your heart lie? And what does it mean to be inspired?

837,“Lake Wateree” by Jack Simpson,,No,2020.0,01 - January,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Mountain-2020-picture-a5d226b5d5ef49b782522deddee448d8,Kelly Yu,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrKa1t9LdlNY_3OYLYghe-rLpOa_LR4bBQnJPZystQo/edit,No,"Using the motor would be a waste of time. So with a paddle in hand we headed back. Sure, if the motor would have done its job we would have been to more places. I watched as my friend had a look that said that he was wishing for a speed boat. I felt the same way also. Boaters raced up and down the lake pointing laughing. We still hadn’t gotten too far away from the landing. The best we figured was at least one hundred yards. Still, we were not defeated, it was anybody’s chance to win the boat. I still could see the look of worry of giving up in his eyes. For a few more smiles, I would have dove in the lake and took a swim. What stopped me was the cold temp. It was not above forty degrees.
Things were about to look up. For some reason we caught a head wind. It pushed us back in the same direction we had just left. No matter how hard we paddled it still kept pushing the boat. Even if we did fire the motor off, all it would do is just make noise. I do believe I could have pushed the boat by foot. Only if I could have found the bottom.
To our surprise the boat ended up a couple hundred yards from where we had left. I had fished this area by myself a good time back. Using minnows and jigs did not produce even a bite much less a fish. For a couple minutes we sat and chewed the fat (and talked). We never even thought about the fish.
The wind died down and the sun began to heat up. Today the weather-man had said it would be in the sixties. This is my kind of weather. I pulled my shirt off to get an early start on my tan. I sat back as if I had no care in the world. It didn’t take long before my eyes closed. I was dreaming of a bass boat with the wind blowing through my hair. The live wells were full of fish and for one I was happy. Soon I would reach the boat ramp. As I turned the boat and slowed down, the dock was in sight.
Something hit me in the chest. I was awake. “Hey goofball?”
“You’re going to let the fish get away?” Joe asked. As he stated I had a fish, not one but two. Both poles were being pulled sideways from the boat.
“Hey Joe!” How about a little help here. No-way, I am catching fish as well. For what seemed like an hour we pulled fish in. Only a few made it back into the water. For once we were still in the game and felt like we had a chance at the main prize. We still had to beat the timeline. It was getting close to one PM.
Our stringer was full of the largest crappie I had seen in a long time. We had to put three fish on the metal clamps that held them closed. It was so full I was in fear of losing them before we reached the landing. I made a suggestion that we place the fish in the boat before we left to head back. For some reason he liked the idea. At least until we started back.
I started to paddle and we were on our way. The wind stayed calm and soon could feel the wind on our faces. This came from the boat moving forward from the paddling, not get it mixed up with the motor running.If anything could go wrong, it was about to happen. Joe decided to try the motor. At the first pill, it was too late to yell “NO”. The motor caught and it was already in gear. The prop cut the stringers into. All the fish we had caught were gone. All I could do was hold my head down, not to even look at the rear of the boat. Joe couldn’t say a word. He was quiet as he shut the motor off. Pulling the metal chain and that was all we had left of the catch of the fay. All the fish were history. At least for this trip. We headed back and soon found out the boat was gliding through the water. There wasn’t much talk on the way back. We seemed to get there faster this time. For once the wind had seemed to be our friend. It really surprised me that the landing had come into view so fast. Most of the other boaters passed by us and some were weighing in. All we still had was the chain from the cut stringers.
As you would figure it. The two of us were defeated, sunburned, hungry, tired, and had no fish. I held my head high, carrying the useless stingers in my hand. There were a few laughs, while others pointed.
Joe on the other hand looked like he lost his best friend. I heard him say,
“Yeah! Yeah!” So we didn’t win. We came in last. “No big deal,” Joe said. There is always next year.
All right everyone settle down. The drawing for the boat, trailer, and motor will begin. We watched as the name was pulled, I turned to walk away. Jor was already at his truck. Our names were called. We, “Won!”
We pulled the boat on the trailer that Joe had borrowed. Hanging on the back of the motor was the fish we thought we had lost at Lake Wateree. We won twice that day."

“Juno please.” I paid here and stepped through the gate. There was no turning back now. Deep down I had no regrets as I took a quick look around. Knowing this would be the last time I would see this place. Not only would a great weight be lifted off my shoulders, I wouldn’t be stuck in no hospital with no machine to keep me alive. Much less be a burden to anyone.
It is a sight to see when you step off a plane in a strange land. It was really hot in Texas. Now I felt goosebumps that I had thought flew south for the winter. No wonder the locals looked at me strangely.
A T-shirt under a short sleeve shirt. A pair of docker shorts. I do believe the deck shoes were a little too much. I was thinking to myself, this was a very bad mistake.
The next morning I had already laid out my plans with no direction in mind. I wasn’t letting the locals know anything. If something did happen to me, I would be just fine. There was no-one to let me know I was missing.
I chose the life I had led. Never married or had kids. I once was married to my job. How do you get a divorce from it? That’s right, you retire.
The portable radio was really useless. It was of little comfort. If you found a station it would fade in and out. The mountains blocked a lot of the signal. The static made more sense than what I was getting. It sounded like a bunch of hungry mosquitoes. I had noticed the clouds were thickening and had turned a shade of gray. If my luck would hold out, it just might snow. That really didn’t bother me, I love snow a lot. A few yards ahead you could hear running water. That would be a welcome sight. I had a canteen. Fresh cold mountain water. I placed my fingers in it only to feel numbness in my fingers. I took a mouthful and started to swallow when my teeth started to hurt. I was worried after I had paid all that money to get them fixed a few years back. Would all be a waste.
Standing looking at the tree line. They could hold any danger. I wasn’t worried, my eyes were on the mountain ahead. I had never been to a place like this. Snow had fallen the night before. It was common for it to do that here.
The mountain seemed to be getting closer with every step. I didn’t realize it at the time. The human eye can see as far off as twelve miles. For me it could have been twenty and it wouldn’t have made any difference. Time is one thing I hoped to have plenty of. At least I had hoped so. My mind was made up. That mountain would be my final resting place. Vince Gill said it best,
“Go rest high on that mountain, for your work is finally done.” Isn’t that funny how one person’s tragedy becomes another’s haven?
Two days later I was standing at the foot of that mountain. My body was slowly getting weaker. Nothing was going to stop me.
Three hours later I was no closer to the halfway mark. Only a goat could climb this mountain fast. That was one thing I didn’t have. Resting a little and a light snack gave me new strength. My watch showed three PM. Soon I would have to find a nice place for shelter. The nights would be cold and windy. This time I had planned ahead. The thermal blanket would help keep me warm. No fire tonight.
The next morning, I was stiff. My legs hurt, my back felt out of place. If I had one more bone in my neck, it would be hurting as well. I had found places I never knew I had.
I reached the top, laid back in the snow. Took a good look around and felt close to heaven. For once, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep. I didn’t hurt anymore. All my pain was gone and I could see the other side."

To her left, a gray, scraggly bearded man with a clipboard appeared from between the trees. He appeared to be mumbling to himself. His dingy Green Bay Packer hat was crooked on his head and his faded blue jean overalls hung like worn curtains on his tall, narrow frame. Startled to see her standing there, he stopped in his tracks. “Oh, howdy ma’am!” He pointed with the clipboard toward the general area of the trees. “I’m just takin’ inventory.”
“I’m… I’m sorry,” Gloria stammered, “I think I’m… I may be lost. I was driving to the
prison in New Lisbon to see my father and I… uh… I uh…. I don't know where I…”
“Oh, you didn’t git tha phone call, huh?” the man interrupted. “These bureaucrats–I tell ya!” he said, shaking his head. “If it ain’t a monkey shuckin’, it’s a turkey jivin’. Tha folks from the state were supposed ta call tha next-of-kin for all the fellas who were in there before tha big change come along an’ turn everythin’ around.”
“The ‘big change’? I don’t… I don’t understand.” Gloria looked intently at the tall man as he adjusted the Packers hat on his head.
“Tha big change,” the man sighed, solemnly stroking his beard. “Well, ‘bout a week ago, the institution mushroomed into a mountain and tha tricky cons and thieves either turnt tha trees or reformed with speedy hooves or feathered wings.” He gestured above his head. A hawk was making slow circles, coasting throughout the sky.
“Tha new prison reform,” the man continued, “that’s how it was all explained ta me.” He flipped through the disheveled papers on his clipboard–a list of names of prisoners and staff. “You were supposed ta git a phone call.”"

This nature hike has made me feel a bit misled.
At least I can get a drink of water to refresh myself.
I’m getting so cold and now my feet are numb.
If everything wasn’t wet I’d light a fire.
One road is all I desire.
I wonder how long it will take for a search team to find me.
And to think, the brochure said, “mountain retreat, a must see!”
There isn’t a soul in sight.
Yet I must not give up, I must fight.
I’m so cold and I need to rest.
No, keep moving is best!
I yell for help, does anyone hear my plea?
I can’t go any further, someone help me.
The ice broke, now my feet are wet, what do I do?
I’m so cold, my skin is red and blue.
Maybe I’ll just sit down for a spell to catch my breath.
Who is that? Is it the Angel of Death?
I’m so sleepy, I’ll just rest here for a little while, that’s all.
Shallow breathing and cold air, what a downfall.
Now my body begins to freeze.
My soul, trapped forever by the evergreen trees."

853,“The Amazing Mr. Wiggles” by Jevon Jackson,,No,2020.0,02 - February,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Dog-ccd64998a9db47f1adff5912543ef047,Kelly Yu,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnKdfLXXUVJaf1rPAFfbSO1JqbFK_6x66IjUAnwUZrs/edit,No,"The reaction was swift–Mr. Wiggles was banned from entering the production lot where his own sitcom was filmed. Network executives replaced him with David Spade and Mr. Wiggles’ character was killed off. He lost all of his endorsements and quickly became a pariah in the Hollywood social scene. Then his owner called the police on Mr. Wiggles for attacking him, unprovoked, in the middle of the night.
Mr. Wiggles was placed in an animal shelter and he stayed there for what seemed like months with no one to come and claim him. Mr. Wiggles called everyone he knew, but no one would answer except for his personal accountant, Greg. And Greg had only more horrible news for him. Mr. Wiggles was bankrupt and owed over $1.3 million to creditors. When Mr. Wiggles, whimpering and almost crying, asked Greg if he would come claim him so he could get out of “doggy jail,” Greg said that his kids were allergic to dogs and hung up.
Although it was a no-kill shelter, the staff there considered euthanizing Mr. Wiggles. Since Mr. Wiggles’ arrival at the shelter, at least three staff had quit because of his callous attitude and berating comments–calling one volunteer a “slut bag” when she forgot to clean his bowl before feeding him. He complained incessantly about the food, his sleeping conditions, the temperature of the building, etc. They placed a muzzle on his snout, but that did little to silence him, as he soon learned to speak as ventriloquists do–speaking with minimal movement of his mouth.
When people came to the shelter to look for pets that they wanted to adopt, the staff kept Mr. Wiggles confined in a back room, isolated and out of earshot. One day, Mary visited the shelter to possibly adopt a pet for her and her husband, Paul. They were older now, and their grandkids were all off to college, so they both were looking for a reason to stay active. While looking at a cute little chocolate Labrador, Mary heard a sad, beautiful voice singing a bluesy slow version of Johnny Cash’s “Rusty Cage.” It came from behind a closed door nearby.
“I’m gonna break… I’m gonna break my… gonna break my rusty caaaaaage and run.”
She opened the door, shuffled inside, and saw only Mr. Wiggles sitting there alone in his cage. This was the pet she wanted to adopt. The staff there advised her against it, and cautioned her that he was a difficult animal. But Mary would hear none of it. Her mind was made up. She was taking him home. Johnny–her new name for him. Mr. Wiggles (Johnny) looked at it like a new beginning so he kept his mouth shut. He didn’t speak a word. They had no knowledge of his past, although Mary suspected she overheard him singing once. Nuzzling there in Mary’s lap, with Paul sitting next to her, Johnny felt like this was the closest thing to a loving family that he ever had. And it was an amazing feeling. Even better than fame, bright lights, and fortune."

I walk Buddy out to the drive to meet them. Joyous reunion. I’m devastated, heart-sick. I can still turn this around. Lure them to the porch. I can claim they never showed up. It will be simple. But, no, I can’t do that to Buddy, I mean Shiloh. He is happy with her. Molly is young and has her whole life before her, with Shiloh. I am just an old man, with an old wife, whose life has passed by.
I can still hear Deb crying behind the bedroom door. Machete in one hand, hatchet in the other, I  rap on the bedroom door. Teary-eyed, Deb opens the door. I end her tears. This is a finality that finishes all her pain. I arrange her on the bed and leave for the garage. Through my own tears I finally find the gas can and return to our bedroom. I douse Deb and the bed first, then the rest of the room. Then I crawl into bed and hold her one last time. Now I light a match. We were old, now there is nothing left. Together in nothingness.
At an intersection, down the road from the burning house, an excited Shiloh is jumping around the car, Molly laughing and giggling at his antics. Then Shiloh falls between Mark’s legs, accidentally hitting the gas pedal. The car surges through the crossroads into the path of an eighteen wheeler. The tractor-trailer rig plows through the car. Mark, Molly and the other driver are killed almost instantly. There is no other traffic, no one to render aid.
A three-legged dog, with a soulful look on his canine face, crawls from the wreckage. On to the next mission."

You bet!
Has she laid faithfully all night at my feet when I work late- You bet!
Has she kept my spot in the bed warm while I use the bathroom in the middle of the night - sure!
I would have to fight her for that spot back, with a low growl, and a yielding whimper.
The short legs and long leaps on a snowy landscape.
The long runs across the grass in the Spring or through leaves in the Fall.
How about across the sandy beach in Summer where she’d dive to the bottom of the lake, or river to retrieve a rock I’d thrown in.
I remember the look on her face when she smelled the load on our first baby’s diaper. She looked at me in an anthropomorphic interpretation of disgust, as if to say “I’m not allowed to do that inside.”
From early on, as a pup, I will always choose you from the others of a litter.
Even today as you lay your head on my lap I try hard not to think about life without your head to pet, ears to scratch, or cold wet nose on my hand.
As I left her at the house, with the family that once gave her to mine, there’s a panic in those soft, brown eyes that I shan’t ever forget.
As I leave her there for the first time ever leaving her anywhere outside of our car for 9 years, I cry.
I shut the door, but I don’t say good-bye.
I’d hoped to see her again in 5 years. (That didn’t happen.)
For the first 2 weeks that’s where she lay, by their front door. As every car approached she would stand up to see if it was me.
When it wasn’t she’d laid back down to wait.
They took her to the vet because she hadn’t eaten since I left and gave her an I.V.
Soon enough she learned to love, again, the family that once gave her to mine. Loving her back while I went to prison."

Some days he needed constant watching over, others just occasional reminding. Putting a little money aside for some help had become a wise investment, and she’d discover a kind of friendship in a big, gentle Derice.
When she made her way toward the living room, she caught a glimpse of Ty though the doorway of their bedroom, sitting up, looking out the window. She altered course, the tea slashing to sting her hand.
“Ty? Are you okay? Are you hurting?” she asked, laying a hand on his shoulder.
“I’m fine, Claire-Bear - just wakeful.” His use of her old pet name told her he was probably having a good day. They sat together quietly, watching the leaves of the old maple in the front yard as they danced in the breeze.
“I was just remembering the way Jeep used to chase the little ones through the sprinkler in the summer-remember that?” she asked. He grinned, chuckling.
“Yeah, old Jeep…” his smile was nostalgic. “When I come back to myself, I can remember all the stuff I’d been forgetting. I feel bad for not remembering the important things, like the grandkids or friends… or Jeep.”
“Old fool” she admonished him, though lovingly. “You don’t do it on purpose. You aren’t letting anyone down.”
“Except you,” he half-whispered, turning to look her in the eyes. She could see a small reservoir of tears threatening to break over his lashes.
“Oh hush -” she began, but he put two fingers over her lips, cutting her short.
“No, you hush, Claire-Bear. Listen, while there’s me enough to say it.” He swallowed hard. “I regret only a few things in this life: never finishing that degree, running that light… and Tammy…”
Claire’s eyes clouded as he mentioned the little girl they’d lost, their first pregnancy, never viable. The doctors had said that risking the birth would have put Claire’s life at risk and the baby’s. Even if she’d lived, they’d probably have had to keep her in a special home, or put their own lives into orbit around her. Claire had grieved, so had Ty - it was a kind of shared misery which, paradoxically, hadn’t ruined them, as such things often do for couples, but brought them closer.
“Before I go for good,” Ty went on, “you gotta know… I love you like a tree loves rain, and I never blamed you for anything we suffered.”
She nodded, smiled, cupped his bristled jaw with one hand. She tried to say “I know”, but her voice was too thick, so she just nodded. And she noticed the bottle on the dresser, its lid left aside. Empty. Like the class beside it. She gasped, eyes going to his. “No!” she choked.
“Love you, Claire-Bear” he reminded her, kissing the palm of her hand, and laying down again. She lay beside him and wept."

I ran to class, ditching Spuds somewhere in the parking lot. By the time recess came, I forgot all about the drama with my dog. The bell rang and a swarm of screaming kids ran for the playground. We lined up for a game of dodgeball when someone yelled “Look a doggie!” To my horror I saw Spuds trotting through a gauntlet of head-patting, ear scratching children.
Then a scream.
Kids scattered from Spuds like flies shooed from a piece of rotted fruit. What I saw I’d never be able to forget, no matter how hard I would try. Spud’s legs were wrapped around the waist of a boy I knew from class, humping away like a hell hound possessed. It was brutal. Spud’s tongue hung from the corner of his mouth. Each thrust poked the boy’s pant leg with what looked like my Grandmother’s lipstick. I had to do something.
“Spuds, No!”
But it was too late. Girls were running and screaming. Boys were pointing and laughing. I charged at Spuds menacingly, breaking his hold on the humiliated boy, who was bawling. Spuds quickly set his sights on a girl named Ruby and was on her like a shot. Ruby’s eyes went wide with terror. She made a desperate break for the monkey bars, hoping to gain the high ground, but in vain.
Spuds latched onto her leg and Ruby shrieked so loudly that Spuds howled, as if he’d heard a siren.
“Damn it Spuds, No! DOWN NOW!”
I tried to be severe, threatening even, like my father, but all that came out was a pathetic weeze.
Ruby shot me a murderous glance. Her brown eyes flashing behind a wall of tears. Ruby was crying, but not because she was sad, or even ashamed -- she was pissed.
“IS THIS YOUR DOG???” she screeched, trying to pry free from Spuds Roman-Greco grip. I denied owning Spuds with the conviction of St. Peter denying Christ to the Romans.
“Hey”, shouted an anonymous snitch. “That’s Harry’s dog!”
“Nuh-uh!”
“Yes it is!” confirmed my best friend Ralph, who I learned that day wasn’t a friend at all.
The mob is a terrible thing. They came in different shapes and sizes, races and ages, and for different reasons. But there is no mob as vicious as a mob of angry children. Some older boys rescued Ruby and drove Spuds away, doubtless impressing her with their Ninja Turtle courage. Then someone tripped me and sat on my chest while kids took turns stuffing sand into my mouth. But that indignity was nothing compared to the shame Spuds brought down on my household. A few months later, my mom backed over Spuds pulling out of the driveway. I can’t prove it, but I think she had a few beers before she started the car. In a cruel twist of fate, the same inspiration that gave Spuds his name would end up killing him. A bit of K9 Karma if you ask me. But the damage was done. I got my ass kicked a lot that year, thanks to that damned dog.
I’d like to think of Spuds in some sort of doggie hell, chased eternally by feral cats and vacuum cleaners.
But every once in a while I think of the dog that would wait for me to come home from school and beg for a belly rub. That’s the dog I miss, not the horny mutant he grew into.
Rest in peace Spuds, and watch out for tires in hell. Damned dirty dog."

You can’t teach bird dogs to chase a ball. It ruins them for the field. Once they chase things other than birds, they will be alert on anything. Ah well. Apparently, I ruined Zero. However, he was allowed to become a house dog where he would lie belly up and spraddle legged in convenient sunny patches, so I guess it all worked out for the best."

A group of young men looking for trouble -- when they met Bo, they found it. He chased them off so quickly I barely had time to react. But, they returned. With a gun.
Pop, Pop, Pop, Bo let out a high pitched yelp and I felt something hot poke my leg. Bo had lunged at the attacker as I dove over Andrea. All but one of the bullets missed.
That one tiny piece of metal went clear through Bo's cheek, ricocheted off my left calf and pierced Andrea's heart. The Doctor told me she didn't suffer and there was nothing left to be done.
Bo was in denial and inconsolable. He refused to leave the front door waiting for Andrea to return. He wouldn't eat or go on walks. He stopped biting and rarely barked anymore. It's as if he had lost his will to exist. I know how he felt. Her loss had left a void so big it seemed we would never be able to cross it.
That Christmas I received a package, seemingly from beyond the grave. It was a picture of Bo and I with an inscription on the back: To my boys. Yesterday. Today. And Tomorrow. She had ordered it and scheduled its delivery before the accident. It was more than I could bear.
I didn't cry when it happened. I didn't cry at the hospital. Not even at her funeral when I carried her on my shoulder. But this, this was too much. I broke down and then I broke the dishes. I stormed around the house demanding answers from God. When I saw Bo, I yelled at him too. I blamed him for not saving her. It should have been you, I shouted. It should have been me, I whimpered. I found the whiskey in the cupboard and looked for answers at the bottom of the bottle.
The next morning I woke up to find myself on the floor. I was twisted around and my arm had fallen asleep. As I turned over I realized Bo was laying on my arm snuggled up next to me. He awoke and we stared at each other nose to nose. He yawned and rolled over on his back, then he looked back at me as if to say, what are you waiting for? I slowly moved my free hand to run his belly. Who's a good boy? You like that? You wanna go for a walk? And with that he jumped up and ran off. He returned with his leash in his jaws, just like he would do with Andrea. His tail wagging brought a smile to my face and in that moment I realized: everything was going to be ok. We would make it through this, together."

He’s a better judge of character than most of the people I know. There’s never a need to get up and chase a bird, squirrel, or stray cat. A well timed bark usually does the trick. He’s got his share of aches and pains. We all do. Every now and then I see him trying to make himself more comfortable. He’ll get up, turn in a circle a few times, then lay back down.
So that got me thinking: what did he change? His position or his attitude. Perhaps it was a little bit of both. It was then when I realized that Bo had given me a lesson in life. Bo is an opportunist. When a chance comes along, he takes full advantage of it. He’s got it all figured out. Life isn’t going to come to us, we have to go out and get it. If we look for the good in people, we will find it. We might not always be able to change our situation, but if we change our attitude - then we’ve changed everything!
So if you’re in town and you see Old Bo give him a pat on the head and share one of your french fries with him. You’ll be glad you did."

It is a deep, intimate, heartfelt feeling that should be reserved for the dearest people in our respective lives. And sadly, even then it's not always reciprocated. This gives even more validity to the logical reasoning behind the words of Anton Szandor Savey that go: ""if anything is used too freely it loses its true meaning. Therefore, you should love strongly and completely those who deserve your love""
Although I would venture to say that even more deaths have been caused in the name of love than hate, I do not deny that love can also produce never-ending happiness, comfort, and tranquility. That is a unique 'unconditional' love, a TRUE love.
I have been fortunate in having experienced that divine love via the love bestowed upon me by my children and my mother. Why they continue to shower me with such unreserved love I do not know. What I do know is that although my actions (i.e. being in and out of jail) speak differently, my love for them is equally unconditional. A fact that they are aware of.
The love provided by my mother and children is more than enough to sustain me and keep me from succumbing to the weight of my sentence. However, I've been single for a long time, and I readily and shamelessly admit that I yearn for a 'special someone' that can fill that particular void in my life. Someone that I can love, and who will reciprocate that love. I am certain that most of us--if not all--do.
But I don' let that desire blind me. I am a man that does, can, has, and will love unconditionally. Yet I guard my love, and I will only grant my love on an individual basis. Not on some exotic 'love all' philosophy that, in reality, isn't love at all. What is so unique about indiscriminate love? Randomly forced love will only serve to lessen one's true feelings. And frankly, show me a person who professes to love one and all, as totally and completely as he loves himself, and I'll show you hypocrisy at its finest.
Being sympathetic to another is not love. Kindness is not love. Courtesy is not love. And charity is certainly not love. None of those are even acts of love, if you ask me. Better put: they DO NOT define love. Maybe that's where the misconception lies.
We can be --and should be--all of the above. At least to those deserving of it (lets face it, not everyone is appreciative. There are many snakes lying, in wait to strike). But let's not confuse any of the above with 'love.' Because when it comes to love--TRUE LOVE--there is no comparison."

Yea, Man might sub--'subjugate' the girl to orgasm. He might even get her strung out on the lovin'. Hell, he might even sub--sub--whatever! Her with muscle to rule by fist, but he can't really have her unless she chose to be got. Then, only with soul, too. Not just hearts cuz they can be crazy stayin' with a dude that be puttin' blows to her breakfast to dinner with a noonday punch. That ain't lovin', that slavin'. And some still love them bastards. Some-wrong with that loony love.
John used to laugh at dudes that say they pulled that girl or got that B-word-girl for bed or bride. Shoot, he'd say the boy be the one 'ttracted by sight or whateva. He'd be the one chasin', bein' the peacock --tho I know hussies that chase the dingalin like a dinner bell. Chow time. Meow, meow.
So I'm talkin' --cuz I ain't got no ears to wax this in; our children grown--'bout John's saying dudes' egos gotta be king, wanna control when they mostly not. She still be the one pullin' a man like a magnet, even some minds, too.
He wrote what he said was a 'sonnet' to me. I'll neva forget cuz he wrote it in my heart twice: In blood and with fire.""This, here, secret most brothers just don't know;He doesn't choose sh!t; the woman choose him.He could make her laugh, put on a good show or be thug or snitch, or have dough or zilchand the woman won't bat a n eye. Yeah, she'llgiggle or cry, get scared or mean and feel whatnot; looking just to see what you got under both hoods. Depending is she's hot, or not, or nerdy or dumb, single or married or lover, the choice will be hers. And you can give cards or beat on her door, Buy her flowers or hex a voodoo curse Crying eyes out, or scream all that you'll do. If you're 'it,' thank her by staying true blue.""
I'll tell you 'bout that blood and fire later. He used to teach me 'bout history, 'bout girls and white folks way back. In Europe, 'bout how they used to hate women. I mean, like they used to dog'em, burn'em, drown'em, tar'em, kill'em and all. Like, was pets to cook, sew, clean, make babies. Sure, they had good ones. I'm talking generalities. Like most: done a lil' to a lot. They women caught brimstones with bare hands. Hell, we're still catching hell on a pitchfork; advantaged of in school, work, army, dates, home, and stuff. Men still stoning women today!
Anyhows, John got this Matriarch prince-pal from Africans way back when, before even white folks. He said that thing's in his blood. Before , the girl was a boy's twin, he'd say. It was the girl side they used to get their pharaoh and chief from. Girls were their priests, too. And they had they say in kingdom to village. Dudes mighta been thinker, builder, fighter and bread winner, but she rolled and baked him and that dough and reared child to age 'til men took the boys for training. He wans't no caveman orderin: You! Do. Now! Ugh. Yankin her hairs while a foot up her behind. And they wasn' sendin off they old to die alone, letting wisdom rot in some corner without their grandkids to teach. All that came afta the ""Fall."" It was all love between sexes way back yesteryears. Which make me think of John's funny notions 'bout religion, too. That that woman-twin prince-pal made everything and folks. It was God, he'd say. That God was queer. Not gay, like, but havin boy and girl in'in. Soft and hard like. How the oldest Afri-God was a pair. Like, two in one that made three. Like that Trinity stuff we good Christians got. That them gods and ghosts Africans had aint God-God, but god's lil' fingers. Divine babies he and his wife-in-him made. Making Creation, each itty-bitty finger did its job. But folks liked and praised some fingers more than others, more than the fingers. And like a hand, each god-finger had a sister or wife that her goddess-fingers of the other hand had. And both hands were the Almighty's. See, there go that Trinity again.
John made me feel a part of him. Who I was and how he loved me, What he loved me with was himself like himself and more. I was the outside of his insides. His mother, sister, wife, and life. His twin. He loved my nature he could make me come out in ways and how I thought and stuff. I aint think about my 'place' comparing to Man but with my man. He was the man and that was that. I, the woman and all woman. We'd let go ourselves to and for ourselves. For him, that was me and me him. We became one love. And lordly, that boy knew some things! Whewh! --where's my fan at? It getting hot in here. That boywas like a mathematician all over, solvin trigger-orgasmtry. When we did the nasty, it was like...cleaned of how folks think and expecting of sex from they mates. He made it so... natural. Shoot, let me stop 'for my 70-yr old butt go dust off my toy!
Anyhows, besides, things done changed. He said that Matriarch stuff started dying out with them Greeks. Said them--then ""Ionians"" or other, after being under Africans and taught -- like Greek Herodotus and Strabo-something-other who was there wrote back then--flipped the script afta that Alexander came up. He show me how Greeks changed up they names. Like, hold on... here: ""Net to Athena, Hathor to Aphrodite, Ptah to Vulcan, Ansue to Pan, Hermes to Thoth,"" and so on and later, Isis and Horus to Mary and baby Jesus. It say here that even St. Augustine himself in Retract I, 13 knew what time it was. You wont hear much about that cuz white folks rulin, now, and how'd it look if the folks they think worse of first taught them? Shoot, they'd jump out of windows like when they money crashed back in -29.
I be sayin cuz it be like how we got to think and do love and girls, now. How it sits on a lot of junk in schoolin, work and play. I ain't talking everyday love or what pass for it. We most all know that. Girls was a bit important to them Caesars, us being their fortune teller being their holy woman and 'black doves.' John used to give them Greeks they props (credit) for making their own stuff, too. Going ahead with it. I betcha if common folk knew, life would be more cool with folks. They'd see we were the other side of the same coin. Get all you can outta love before you die.
But we're talking a whole lotta yesteryears growing up in the rough: long enough to change skin and hair and how you think. Had lil time for love, I'd speculate, surviving in ice age. But once thawed out and got comfy, they made fine things and wrote beautiful love poems. I can relate, you know, but shoot, I ain't known no folks, tho, aho'd ever think so fine to wanna cut an atom. For what? Just to see if they can? What an atom do to them?
So's John said that most why they treated women and every folks they 'discovered' so bad. From that long rearing, needin to autop- autopsy everythin instead of lovin what is itself. Themselves, too, till they learnt the world wasn't flat. And cut open and divide everybody from sea to sea. Guess all folks still growin up. Teenage brats that want everything they see, experimenting, breaking their toys and not really knowin why, not lovin their toys. We still aint adults yet.
Girls come a-ways in this circle, but men still spittin in our face. Like splashin us the face of that Abu-degrade stuff. That Lindy girl be dead-stinkin-wrong and show girls can get down like men. Why her face, tho, when more dudes did the Abu-normal stuff too? Blame the girls. Again. Cuz, I'm guessin deep-down dudes still hatin and fearin. No deep-down love unless it's solo for girlfriend or wife or mama and cash. John'd say like that Palestinian chikin his two sisters to death cuz they chose their own fiancées; them 'honor' killings for family name but not love or family blood where it counts. Or just human blood.
Then there's John friend IGod --now what in Jehovah kinda name is that--who be callin folks devils like Malcolm X did. Afta Mr. Flinney --a.k.a. Flinstone cuz he so mean and cheap---first hid John from the Po-nine (cops), and his fine (for a white girl) wife Sue, who ran him like he ran the store, argue that poleece Chief down for John, john started sayin they all ain't all bad. That some were like missionary types that be doin things for folks on love prince-pal. IGod''s say those do as if they goin to heaven for a 'noble' deed, not outta love, but some guilt trip; for a check mark on their resume card. IGod said , it not be their hearts, but for show and secret reason till their jobs done. John said the devils be their leaders. IGod'd ax where their rulers come from, then, but out the same pond. That'll always shut John up a sec', then he'd say what about their friend Brian, or that John Brown and A.P. Randolph cat? IGod'd say they be exceptions or have stakes to ride the coattails like they did King and Malcolm; like on their civil rights bandwagon like them hippies and kids and feminists and sex and bunch of revolutions that came out their closet.
They'd go back and forth with nobody within bout why folks love and what they do or not do for love and hate. Guess, everybody be lovin themselves more than anything. I be thinking if they loved like John love the girl then they'd love and help all themselves, too.
Well, I wondered about some of John's thinking cuz he mostly didn't trust white folks cuz of racism and some 'good' folks not even knowin they are till push-come-shove. The blood and fir stuff come then, same time him and IGod used to talk race. I wondered to find my John poking Flinstone's Sue in the church cellar afta bible study! Some studying they were doin...That went on afta, too, and it burned me so's I get some git-back instead of takin a nite with our one kid, then. Well, he found out, too, and stepped to my lover. The cat pulled out the hammer (gun) but John didn't fold. Scared the heebee-jeebees outta me, but he faced death for me. He took a bullet cross the arm, but got that hammer. He beat dude with it, but that cat snitched. That's when the Flinney's helped out and I didn't see John for two weeks. I ain't see Sue, either for that matter, he was holing up in her still, healin.
Made me jumpin jealous he gave her his best and heart, too, she then wantin to steal him to be groom for life. Couldn't get enough of him, even hurt. I guess she fell in love too., she havin tamed her mean hubby, loved John's wild heart, trying to tame what she couldn't and got tamed instead. Then John came back and asked me straight: what we're gonna do. Well, we chose each other then even tho I could see he still loved that girl. Knowing him now, he would have faced death for her, too. That's when he wrote that poem, afta we hooked back up.
I neva understood how he'd die for me but doin Sue at the same time. It took a year to really forgive each other. I didn't even ask why: white girl 13 years older when he was 15 years older than me!! Boy, that boy was some kinda backwards with his notions. He neva really understood women in common-sense ways. I din't hum, some , either. Girls always confused him, expectin them to see all what he saw and felt inside, till he learnt me good. Then come the most good times with our years. All the nice lil surprises wheneva I learnt about him and how he love me more with whatevea he learnt about me. How he was happy with joy to find something new and lovin me anew, like. And I got to know and love him like neva before.
Well, we've been through it all for the best rest of our years. Till he passed. He sure had some pee-culiar notions, tho, about women. He loved me and my whole body from big head to tiny toe. Okay, I'm zagerating, he didn't like my knobby elbows cuz I'd always nudge him with one. I guess my John was just...real. Deep-sensual, like. He didn't just love just to touch just my body, but loved to touch inside; to touch heart and soul or my spirit and caress my existence. All I was and been through that made me, me. He just loved women the old fashion way, I'd say, takin good with bad and makin something beautiful. Made me proud to be woman, his girl, when he could of skipped on me. Still, he let me be me and be the most sexiest girl in the world, which made him the most sexy to me. We 'conquered' life together. He was my other half, my twin.
And I ain't zagerating when I tell you the tom-foolery stuff he had put on his grave-stone, by some Yeates dude and from the good Book:""Beauty is Truth and Truth is Beauty""""God stands amongst the assembly of the Divine One; in the middle of the gods he judges: ...You are gods! And you are sons of the Most High, but surely you will die as men and fall like the princes."" (Psalms 82:1-7) Yeah, and I was his Goddess, for sure."

I consciously know that from this Awareness of my Oneness with God, I radiate the Light of this direct Energy of Love to all beings everywhere, to all places, and to all things. All persons, places and things rest in the Light and Love of my Heart. And we exchange and share this love as peace and joy.
I see no offense, receive no offense, or intentionally give offense to anyone. I accept love and receive all beings equally in my heart. I release all judgment and criticism, and forgive everyone and everything that has ever caused me pain and upset and I forgive myself for all my own past ignorance and unloving ways.
With love and forgiveness I releases all past wrongs against me or from me, and create a Clear Space that allows for all people to come and go in Peace and Joy as I accept them just as they are. From this Clear Space of Unconditional Love and Acceptance I witness life's events with humor and compassion allowing all people to be themselves and express themselves with no thoughts or feelings from me of resentment, envy, jealousy or criticism. This Clear Space now allows me to accept life just as it is. As I accept what's so, as it comes up, I am at peace. And if it should happen that life presents me with unfriendly or uninvited pain producing experiences, by my loving and accepting what's so about it or experiences to occur in their place. My resistance to any happening only strengthens and prolongs its stay in my experience. My unconditional Love and Acceptance for any event, by my non-resistance, does not add to it, but it allows it to pass freely on.
By being friendly to everyone and everything, everyone and everything is being friendly to me and aiding me, rather than harming me or limiting me. In this openness of Acceptance and Love I am at peace. I am Happy! I am Free!"

This time though was unlike anything I had ever done before. At first I did it alone, but soon I involved my little brother. In 5 months we burglarized almost 100 businesses. All of my part went on cocaine, except for 50 dollars a week for a roach infested efficiency.
My brother's girlfriend went with us on one of our jobs and my mother found some stolen stuff in her closet and turned us in. We didn't know that she had signed a statement against us for a few months, but one day 3 police came knocking on our door. My brother answered the door and we were carted off to the county jail.
In all I spent 2 years and 8 months in prison. I tried to make the best of my time there. I took a general maintenance class and computer class they offered. I started doing Bible studies through the mail and acquired several certificates from a number of places.
Once I got through I forgot all about what I had learned. I bought a pack of cigarettes before I got on the bus and that night I was drunk, had smoked a joint, and taken pills for the first time.
I kept the same job for 2 years and 3 months, but after I got my second DWI, I knew they were going to send me back to prison. I burglarized several places and used the money and took off for Tennessee. After a year there I had gotten another DWI and I got caught one night I was out drunk breaking into businesses. I ended up spending 2 years and 3 months in prison there. I had left a bloody fingerprint at a car lot I had burglarized in Duthart, TX and they did DNA testing and the results came back three days before they were going to release me from Tennessee.
I was extradited back to Texas and convicted again for burglary and had my parole revoked. I have now been locked up here again for 1 and a half years with 6 more to go. I am up for parole again in Oct. of 2005. I don't expect to be granted parole because of my numerous offenses throughout the years.
I add up all the time I have spent locked up as a child and an adult and it adds up to eight years and two months. So what have I really learned so far in my short life. I know I don't like being locked up. Who does? I've learned to hate. For me this is a dangerous emotion, because it makes me self-destructive. I only want to get out and live my life. I don't know how I am going to do this because my family has all but abandoned me this time. No job prospects, nobody waiting for me with open arms. Maybe this time, having to go it alone I will do better. Who knows? I started out writing this about growing older and it's totally gone off kilter. I know many people have it far worse that me and I shouldn't sit around feeling sorry for myself. What are we to do then? Prisons offer almost no chance for rehabilitation. I am not in a very violent prison, but the guards treat us like we are dogs. They speak to us any way they feel. They pounce at the chance to take anything they can from us. They are petty and vindictive. I have all but lost hope for myself. I'll probably end up back in prison growing older."

That proverbial hourglass turns over and with every grain of sand that falls, so does a piece of our existence.
Aging is supposed to be a blessing. The bible even says in Proverbs that a gray head is a crown of glory. But to a prisoner doing life of a long sentence, witnessing in that 8x12 mirror age lines cut into his face while his hair turns the same color as the walls that contain him, it's more a nightmare than a glory.
But then I look at myself, 12 years after that first ""gray hair scare"". Many more have since taken up residence. I even have a couple on my chest. Maybe the stress of my trial, combined with the trials and tribulations of doing time; of surviving in a ""zoo"" where all the ""animals"" are allowed to congregate in the yard, contributed to this early gray. But I see now, with crystal clear clarity, that getting older is indeed a blessing. There are many youngstas in the grave who I'm sure wish they weren't.
And at 39, I'm in tip-top condition! I actually feel 19. I can easily knock out 1000 push-ups in under an hour. I can run circles around the average youngsta coming in. And even the alleged ""conditioned"" young bucks who try to hang with me on my bar work and calisthenics routines often complain that I'm ""trying to kill them"" -- more like heal them.
So to that extent, I will venture to say that doing long stretches in prison can have its blessings (and no doubt its curses) physically. I am very blessed. But I'd love to be out there on the beach somewhere, in my Bermuda shorts, showing off a little. Those jet skies out there look like a lot of fun. Can't forget about those lovely creatures in bikinis. Hence, that ""curse"".
But not to be outdone, my mental and spiritual development actually rivals my physicality. I have a degree in Economics and Theology. I type extremely with little or no typos. And more than anything, I have a passionate love affair with writing. All this acquired while ""aging"" behind the walls.
In 1996 at the California Men's Colony, I co-wrote a play ""Change Gon' Come"", to be performed by some enthusiastic prison actors. I had a ball doing the casting, rehearsing and directing. I wasn't there to see it performed on stage as I was relocated to another prison before the show. But I heard it got a standing ovation!
I now write poetry, stories, songs, personal proverbs and screenplays. However most of my energy of late has been focused on my legal pursuits. I am actively seeking my liberation. Funny thing about ""liberty"" and all the cynicism that may come with it; it's like a tolerant lover whom you often take for granted -- until you lose her, only to realize, now wrapped in a blanket of sadness, that you love and miss her so much.
So as I continue to do the time, and not let it do me, I cling to the understanding that we all are doing time...it just depends on where and how...age well."

Some of us are changing for the good and some for the worse. I believe it is a good and worthwhile thing to age!

He was a proud 18- year-old. Laughing, I told him he was just a baby, still wet behind the ears. He asked my age, which I stated with equal pride, ""26 years old and old beyond my years"". ""Your not old yet, you have 4 more good years left"", he told me with verve. I was tempted to spank him. That was nearly 20 years ago and I am still here. My hair is sprinkled with gray, and lines crinkle my eyes. Maybe I'll be old at 60. Probably not. At least my mind will be young, or think it is.
Youth is often synonymous with arrogance. What can we learn from some old fart who's made a mess of his own life? Do we ever think to learn from the wisdom earned from trial and error, often at great cost?
Though I have a tendency to creak like an un-oiled hinge when I first arise each morning, and I have made a royal mess of my life, there is still much advise awaiting a patient youth willing to take time to listen. I search for a creature rarer than a unicorn. When you see a smug grin on an ancient face, it may not be the result of passing gas in there Depends. They may have an idea of your future and have given up on trying to warn you. You never listen anyway.
Time is a matter of perspective. To some it is kinder than others. There is a common factor. No matter your age there is only one way out of getting older. As for me, I'm not ready to go yet. There are books to read and smiles to share. The day will come, as it must for all of us, when there is no choice left except to cross the Styx and explore another realm of existence. This shall be embraced, as all adventures must be, for there are numerous theories of what lies beyond deaths revolving door, and I will glory in proving most, if not all, of them wrong; if I don't prove they are all right."

Again, probably not suitable for teaching young children, but even at that age, I knew it was serious and not to be taken lightly. Here are the lyrics I remember:
```
The sword of time
Will pierce our skin.
It doesn't hurt

But as it works
It's way on in
The pain grows stronger
Watch it grin.
Suicide is dangerous.
It brings on many changes.

Let me explain that Mrs. Ward didn't just give us the words to sing and leave us to figure out their meaning. She explained their symbolism, told us what this or that meant, cautioned us that taking a life, your own or someone else's, was something we should all avoid doing. She let us ask questions, and, for myself at least, treated us as real people who could think, understand, and discuss a topic of such a serious nature. I still have the utmost respect for that woman and an equal amount of disdain for the principal that forced her to stop allowing us to sing those sings and crediting us with the ability to think for ourselves.
Anyway, the lyrics in the song obviously speak of aging and the pains associated with it. Mrs. Ward said she thought the ""sword"" symbolized cancer and the ""grin"" was the grim reaper enjoying the prospect of the coming death. Then and now I believe it means, plain and simply, getting' older hurts, sometimes in ways we don't expect.
The chorus? Just what it says. Almost everyone has the choice to end his or her own life, but before doing so we should realize that many, many people would be affected by that choice. Sure, with the billions of people on this planet one more or less really shouldn't mater much, right? I don't know, maybe. But if you aren't around how are you going to know for sure if you wouldn't have made that difference, that little something, in someone's life?
Yes, there are many aches and pains associated with aging. The reverse is also true; there are many wonderful joys and pleasures to be experienced in life, also. Stick around and see what you can make of tomorrow. Maybe you can be the one to put a smile on someone's face and a song or two in their heart. Strive to make the word a better place in all you do and others will follow your example."

I may be mistaken, but I believe that the average life expectancy is between 70 and 80 years of age. That being the case, it's a great possibility that I will grow old and die somewhere within this vast arid wildeness of steel and stone that is our so-called justice system.
Having long overcome any spiritual disillusionment of immortality in some intangible paradise after death, I cherish my life for all that it's worth. Here and now is what I believe in. So I do what I can -- here and now -- to take care of myself and try to hinder, as much as possible, the effects of aging on my body. My one desire is to age graciously and live long enough to be released so that I can die amongst my loved ones in the world. That is my motivating factor each and every waking hour. That, in my opinion, would be paradise.
For that purpose alone I hold self-preservation as the highest law in my small, secluded world. Getting old and dying in prison is a very conceivable course of events that weigh heavily on my mind daily. However, I do not allow those thoughts to overwhelm me to the point that will render me despondent, mired in a perpetual state of melancholy. Instead, I take those negative thoughts, feelings, emotion, and convert them into positive energy that can be used to exercise my mind and body. Guys come to prison with ridiculous sentences and slim-to-none chances of ever being released, and they try to take their own lives. I cannot respect, under any circumstances, the taking (or attempting to take) of one's own life. In spite of my situation, I do not consider my life meaningless, or hopeless. Granted, this is not the most attractive, nor the most ideal life that one would aspire to achieve. It's definitely not a life that I would recommend to anyone. But this is MY LIFE, and due to that unfortunate fact, I must embrace it with open arms. That is not to say that I'm proud of my accomplishments. Or lack thereof, rather. I am, nevertheless, very proud of the man that I have become with age.
Unfortunate as it may be, aging and subsequently death, are prices that we must all inevitably pay for our earthly existence. And depressing as THAT is, I deal with it in the same fashion that I deal with being sentenced to life in prison: I accept it. With age, I've learned the value of acceptance. That (acceptance) is a major element in life that enables me to remain positive under adverse circumstances, and without it I could not continue to progress in my quest to fulfill my one desire: to die amongst my family.
I have focused more on death that the original topic, but then again, isn't aging simply a more genial term to use to define dying? After all what is death but the inescapable conclusion to the dismal story of aging.

You know just in one sentence, you can express love or hate, happiness or sadness. Which ever comes first, you find it is more bearable to express ourselves. This brings pleasure and contentment. Accompanied with just enough imagination, a paragraph can take you outside the space of your domains into a world more suitable for you. I will even go so far as to say writing is equally pleasurable with the art of controlling your dreams to befit your outcome. Or the technique of traveling in one's spirit to places you've always wanted to visit on any occasion.
Daily I welcome myself to a world where I'm fully in charge, where only my laws exist, where there is love, peace and harmony, and where happiness supersedes sadness by a large margin. When I exploit my creative writing, I'm likely to be anyone, be anywhere, having anything, and capable of doing whatever. No one is there to stop me--whether if it depicts beauty or heniousity. Who said simple pleasure has to conform to morality. On the personal level it regards no strictures or anyone else's opinions, and will take none into account.
Simple pleasure of this kind is hardly ever limited; as it takes on a variety of forms to bring you pleasure. Needless to say, if proficiently applies, it can also be accommodating to relieving stress itself. Also, if I'm not taken the pleasure in creative writing, though other techniques of writing I can destroy the monsters I created, the image I gave it, rectify the problems I caused, demolish the troubles I've made, and heal the hearts I've broken. Why? Because it is simple pleasure to do a good deed, to be the origin of positive results or to be the reason someone is able to smile again, all through writing.
I am a novelist, a poet, and screenwriter, and for me, living up to those attributes at 100% is absolutely simple pleasure for me."

Nevertheless, they are simple pleasures, at least for me. And, to show my appreciation, I will participate in the projects offered. No matter how small it is, someone may just derive a simple pleasure from reading it, at least that's my hope.
However, to get a little philosophical here, I want to comment on the perception of happiness. We ""feel"" happy about something that we have come to understand, otherwise if there's no understanding of that which could have us feeling happy then we would in no sense be happy. Without, however, the knowledge or understanding of that which could make us happy there would be absolutely no feeling of happiness. All this to say that, by coming to a true understanding of our self (the ancient Greeks had an inscription over the temple of Delphi, ""Know yourself"") do we obtain the ability to connect with our inner-self and can then guide ourselves to ""simple pleasures"" that would otherwise be lost in the hurly-burly of the prison environment.
For me, I now can find the simplest pleasure from just about anything. But I must be careful not to overdo it (the Greeks also had another inscription over the temple of Delphi, ""Nothing in excess""), because me ""keepers"" might begin to think I'm a little too funny, know what I mean? Moderation (sophrosyne) was the basic and most characteristic Greek virtue. I'm not ready for the funny farm, nor am I, unlike Socrates, ready for my ""elixir"" of thorazine, just yet. Society already labels me and obvious defective.
Schopenhauer mentioned that Metrodorus was the earliest disciple of Epicurus. Epicurus of Samos (342-270B.C.), in which the school of Epicureanism was founded, and his followers adopted pessimism, they claimed that the best life has to offer is the avoidance of pain. They also proposed a hedonistic attitude, according to which happiness consists of pleasure; true pleasure is the achievement, through great moderation, of serenity of mind and heart. I believe this introduces some ancient thoughts (or philosophy) on the matter of simple pleasures.
The simple pleasures that I'm experiencing in my quest for truth and knowledge, is that I'm free to devote my full energies searching for truth in all its hideaways. By being in prison, I'm allowed the convenience of leisure and can therefore forego the pursuit of money, power, women, family and other personally oriented values. Not that, on a small scale, these aren't obtainable or even somewhat pursued but they are for the most part put aside. I'm writing from the perspective of an ad-seg. 'or (segregation). So situationally, I'm naturally able to focus more on obtaining a complete awareness of reality that I never before took the time to do, and with that awareness a newfound courage within myself of my abilities to be a worthwhile person -- not the ""defective"" that I once even viewed myself as.
The opportunity to present this essay is another instance of which I can testify to, that has me ""simple pleased"". A precept from a contemporary fellow prisoner, David Lane, goes thusly: ""One measure of a man is his cheerfulness in adversity."" I truly believe that if a person really wishes to be happy --no matter what--then they will find a way to make is so. At least this philosophy works for me. And who knows, it may work for you too. Remember no one can take your spirit unless first you give it up. Stay strong and grow. -The End- Mike ""Hoss"" Mincey"

Never is it easy. But, neither is it always terrible. As with most situations in life, it is up to each of us to decide whether we will make lemonade or just such our lemons and pucker.
Sweeping the sidewalk, as two officers watched and horse played, such a simple pleasure fell in my arms. Officer Louder shoved Ms. Black, harder than he had intended, in my direction. She was falling toward the concrete when by pure reflex I dropped my broom and caught her. There I stood with a lovely lady lying in my arms like a lover, looking deep I my eyes. It was a beautiful moment until I realized how many rules we were violating and reluctantly set this beauty back on her feet. Undoubtedly she has forgotten. I never shall. She is the only lady I have held in twelve, long years and very well may be the last.
Cell windows have often brought me delightful sights. My transfer to high security Ad-Seg cost me that privilege. Late one summer night an undeniable scent in the air drew me to look for the culprit. As I scanned the brightly lit prison grounds from the concealment of my darkened cell's window where I witnessed a special threesome gamboling along. Mama Skunk must have weighed fifteen pounds; her glistening coat, fluffed and silken, made her look twice that size. The little stinkers were just balls of fluff. Joy engulfed me as the little ones chase bugs in the grass. For a long time I sat watching them play till finally they were out of sight. Even those long years later they are not out of my mind. Have you ever watched a spider spin a web? It is one of the wonders of nature. That same window provided me with a big, black, fuzzy one, which came to my attention one lonely morning. Unfortunately my cell partner at this time was one with a bully mentality. Not easy to get along with. Seeing me intently watching my window, smiling, he couldn't resist disturbing me. When he asked me what I was watching I foolishly told him. He was indignant, all spiders must die. He reached across me, where I lay on my bunk, intending to kill mine, I told him that if the spider died so would he. He was just a bit upset. Luckily for all of us he made the right decision and left my spider alone. Instead he got moved and the spider made a much better companion. You have to draw a line somewhere. But, I'm glad I didn't have to explain that to a judge and jury. My fellow prisoners would understand; no one else ever could.
The first time I got released from Ad-Seg they put me outside for the night because they didn't have a proper cell for me. That may sound horrid to you; to me it was wonderful. Bats were out and the stars were shining bright against a black velvet sky. Hours I lay and watched the midnight acrobats. If I had gotten angry I would have missed one of those moments of simple pleasure that make memories.
It's rather easy to forget your position with a certain type officer. Mr. Olson is one of those good and friendly types. Whenever he was assigned to work the hall where my crew worked I would promptly volunteer to stay during noon count and let the rest go home early. The work was done and the only reason anyone had to be there was in case of some accidental mess being made that needed cleaning up. Count could last for hours and it was time spent talking to ""Big-O"" about hunting, fishing, shooting, and other free world activities. At times we would share a companionable silence. It was one of those quiet times when ""Big-O""'s tendency to nap was showing itself. In his company I never felt like a prisoner. For that reason, as we kicked back, I never thought twice about what to do when an oversized, kamikaze mosquito divebombed onto his kettle drum size stomach. It was an irresistible situation. With a thump of my hand that mosquito was history. ""Big-O"" had no way of knowing there was a mosquito. He opened one eye and gave me a quizzical look that said very plainly I had a short time to explain. Worlds wouldn't come, it was too funny, so I reached over where this critter still lay and lifted it up by one wing. With a nod of his head he returned to his nap as if nothing unusual had occurred.
With most officers I'd have been rooting for the mosquito. These stories, and many more, have been added to my memories. They can never replace the simple pleasures found in freedom. Children, pups, and the warmth of a hug. A soft bed with room to stretch or a walk along a woodland path. There is in every memory a reminder of the simple pleasures lost because I didn't appreciate freedom's worth. Now I know it is the most priceless of treasures. It is probably too late for me to save my squandered fortune. Is it too late for you? Hopefully not."

Here no one is needed just wasting away. Hake it, make believe that everything is okay. What a lie. When deep down a person knows the truth. Truth, I would say that this is just another simple pleasure that's gone. In here a person can be deceived by other inmates or staff to the point where the truth does not exist anymore.

I can challenge the impulse to perpetuate childish insults by stifling my pride and ego, controlling the situation, and being a mature adult in every aspect of social interactions from dayroom to visitation.

If the reader would pay close attention to the connotations of the underlined word above, he and she will notice that there is nothing in those terms that defines natural human intercourse. Every connotation connotes one mechanical undertaking or another. How can a human personality be suitable -- suitable to what -- your subjective likes or dislikes?! The same query must be ventured regarding a proper or its anatomical counter -- improper character and so forth.
In short, if a human is a small part to be twisted, adjusted, adapted, to join, etc., we had better rethink our anthropologically cultural and social prescriptions. If people do not naturally gravitate in a particular direction, we should not try to make them fit. Meanwhile, Webster's offers over thirty different connotations and variations of our ""in"" word... but we will concern ourselves with only a few that fit into our talk. In fact, I think that merely one suitable or rather solid definition shall suffice that relates here: Any of various mass actions or gatherings of a (specified) type, as a political demonstration of a form of entertainment. In this instance, Webster's refers to words like ""mass,"" ""collective,"" ""be in,"" etc. SO in this sense, one must be a part of the mass or of the collective to be in, aye? In any case, the problem is that the masses, so to speak, often feel that we all should adhere to the same social, political, and cultural views. And there is the conflict! For example, imagine yourself, good reader, walking through your city park in a blue-skied, sunny day. Simply enjoying yourself in nature's magnamity: the beaming, warm sun, green soft grass, lovely trees that seemingly reach the skies, and whatnot. And as you continue your stroll, you, by perchance, stumble upon an attractive crowd of Homo sapiens gathered on a patch of the park's friendly grounds. About ten people, men and women.
So you, being a social creature, so to speak, venture amiably over to that unassuming group of people. ""Hello,"" you say, as you assemble among them curiously.
""High there, sir,"" says a man named Michael, who seems to be the leader of the pack. Then he tells you to sit down, and you do. Next, a fair lady in her sundress reaches into a cooler and draws from there a cold soda which she offers you, benevolently. Then, another man offers you a pamphlet that reads on its cover, ""Support U.S. Patriot's War on Terrorism!""
""Tell us about yourself,"" Michael says. ""Well, my name is Lavelle. I'm a short story writer and a railroad worker. I'm off today and I thought I would enjoy some time alone in the park. Then I saw you noble people gathered here, apparently enjoying each other, then I thought I should like to join,"" says my smart reader whom I, by the way, have arbitrarily though expediently named Lavelle.
In return, the leader of the pack informs you, ""Lavelle, we're a group called Americans Against Terrorism. Would you like to join us in a political dialogue?"" ""Sure,"" you say, being a natural polemicist and a haughty debater. ""Now, then,"" comes Michael. ""Today, our question is: why not support the troops in Iraq. You see, Lavelle, in Iraq they are building weapons for mass destruction! We will find them, to be sure. Secondly we want those Muslim thugs over there in the Middle East to know that in America we will not be intimidated by their rag tag regimes! The ""civilized world"" will not be cowed by thugs, goddamnit!"" Michael's face turned red as he pontificated passionately. ""They are a threat to our national security, Lavelle. And our group is trying to do away with all of this dissonance in the homeland and foster a community of real national unity,"" he concludes. He also apologizes for getting so worked up.
Then you, Lavelle, counters with, ""Sir, what draws you to the conclusion that America is civilized in contrast to the Arab people?"" ""Come on,"" begs the leader of the pack. ""America is a god-fearing nation. We are a democracy!"" All the members begin ferverently clapping now. But you, Lavelle, are no pushover.
""Wait a minute!"" you declare indignantly. ""I have a problem with you zealots negating the humanity of other human beings by inadvertently categorizing them as savages by implication."" Then, suddenly, all the members' faces turn red, maniacal, and malevolent, and you, by instinct, know that you better get the hell out of Dodge. You should have minded your own damn business and enjoyed your simple walk in the park, aye?
The leader of the pack, finally, after little deliberation, gets up and says, ""I'm sorry Lavelle. You don't fit in, sir. We can't ruse you... now get gone! You unpatriotic, ungrateful swine!"" The author hopes that by way of this short, friendly discussion and dialogue that he has shed some light on the coercive potentials of the concept of fitting in, if we hold it so rigidly. Meanwhile, I will leave my readers with a quotable quote from an 18th Century illustrious English philosopher named John Stuart Mill, who himself was a staunch proponent for individual freedom and free discussion. The following is an excerpt from his long 1859 essay entitled ""On Liberty"", a must-read for thinkers, and certainly for the narrow-minded nonthinkers. Mill wrote: ""Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a trec, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces with make it a living thing."" Very well, then."

Mike is one of those too. It's absolutely impossible to get the concept of individual freedom through to them on certain subjects. Mike and I have found ways to compromise on most issues.

My personal view of abortion is that I would never have one. Being a guy I don't have to worry about it. If guys got pregnant abortions would be an inalienable right.
They get pretty upset over the homosexual marriage thing too. Can't see where it's any of their business if they are not homosexual.
If you ever yearn to butt your head against a brick wall, try to explain the difference between the theory of evolution (based in science) and creationism (religious myth) to conservative Christians.

Boy, will they be surprised to get to heaven -- if they get to heaven -- and find God invented evolution.
This leads us back to where we started. As you see I don't fit in. There are Christians all around me, not all as willing to allow me to think for myself as Mike, and I am forced to have dealings with them on a regular basis. Do I feel alienated? Often. That is the price I pay to retain my individuality. Well worth it at any price.
It is better to be alone with yourself, proud of who you are, than to be accepted by those who espouse beliefs you would be ashamed of. My silver lining is that it allows me constant opportunity to hone my ability to defend my views.
As I've told many, I am willing to defend anyone's right to believe as they choose. Contrary to popular opinion, America was not built to accommodate any single belief system but to protect the rights of all Americans to believe, or not, as they choose. My choices are different from most, some might call them eccentric, though precious to me.

Some find comfort and acceptance in a circle that suppresses the emotional trauma in substance abuse.
In college or our twenties, individualism becomes semi en-vogue. Oftentimes, that acceptance or ability to fit in is squandered in addiction. This road inevitably leads to failure, madness, depression, death, or prison. Upon entering the world of drug dealing and felonious activities to support a habit or in search of instant gratification, prison represents itself as the next arena. Where you have to find a way to fit in there, too, often, the ""individual"" is seen as easy prey for the group. The ramifications of being a loner can be costly all they way around.
""Fitting In"" in prison can be easy with the mask of a racist and a willingness to hurt other people warranted or not. While wearing this mask, you stand to lose part of your soul. But you'll be down for yours and your race, but it is in the mirror you are an unrecognizable shell who sold out to fit in and survive. The philosopher Steiner said, ""a handful of might is far greater than a whole bag of right."" While this can be a safe modus operandi, the cost is greater than the prize of fitting in, being feared, and commanding respect. Parole doesn't end the cycle. Now one must fit in against even greater odds. With serious consideration to this cycle, one becomes aware how ""Fitting In"" is as much an oxymoron as jumbo shrimp or an honest politician.

In prison conformity is a matter of survival, so I don't have the luxury of totally rejecting it. Unless, of course, I want to get murdered by someone. There are certain unwritten rules in prison, a sort of convict code of conduct. It has nothing to do with obeying the authority figures, the cops. It is strictly a socially Darwinian code of conduct in operation among the convict population. Any perceived weakness will be exploited, so you must be strong and be perceived as strong if you expect to survive for any length of time. So what if you are convicted of murder? So am I. Who have you killed or maimed lately? That is the general attitude among many convicts, at least in the prisons in which I have spent the last decade.
If you are a chump or a coward, word will get around and you will be robbed, maybe beaten or stabbed. Pathetic isn't it? That is just the predatory nature of prison life. So conformity is a matter of survival in prison. Every so often you must smash somebody to keep up appearances, until everybody knows you won't hesitate to break their face. Then you can do your own thing, for the most part, like I do now.
Despite the predatory nature of prison social structures, nobody is forced to join prison gangs. It has been my experience that those who join such gangs are weak and find their security in numbers, which is why they join a gang in the first place. No, I don't want to be in your prison gang, thank you very much. I ride solo.
Sometimes; however, you have no choice in the matter. Occasionally there will be a race riot. Then you are grouped together with your own race by circumstances beyond your control. For instance, I once found myself attacked by a group of convicts of another race simply because I happen to be white and a race riot started on the yard. I was certainly fitting in that day.
Were I to attempt to completely fit in with the majority of the Maximum Security prison population in California, I would need to submit to a level of conformity that would render me a mindless, pathological idiot. I cherish my individuality. I relish my independence, and I revel in the knowledge that I stand out. I don't want to be one of ""them"", either in prison or in society at large.

Life always seems to go on.
It was market day. Many of the village’s women and children who could not work in the fields scurried onto the road headed to town for buying, selling and trading the products of their labor. Up ahead was a detour into the wilderness that would hide their presence. They rushed through the trail to avoid the conflict and stay out of sight, but so did their counterparts.
Blades slicing through mid-air fight at low altitudes echoed dangerous concern. They found the main road once again that channeled their path near the rice fields containing wounded neighbors. Fear drew within their souls, stunning their actions as gunfire roared its discharge from the nearby villages. Voices travelling with an unknown tongue raised anxiety and panic through their minds. American troops crept closer, narrowing My Lai tribes men’s attempt to escape.
Losing their advantage and searching for a new escape route, the villagers pushed their way back into the wilderness in fear. Fighting began to break out all around them, realizing they were trapped and cut off in every direction. Their only hope of protection became the trench which ran alongside the village roads.
Silently, they eased their numbers into the clammy merk. The waters chilled them to the bone, stealing a whimpering breath as they slid into a dark, shadowless end. Gruesome speculation consumed them as they shivered in silence. Hugging the the banks, their loved ones and their neighbors, they whispered their prayers, I-love-yous and goodbyes when the gunfire began. Helos flew in low and fast, skimming at a three foot ground troop drop… The gun ships seemed to skim the Earth’s surface for less than a second, just long enough to push its troops out and lift off again on the prowl for their opponent.
The unit just began to work the perimeter when they spotted a crowd of women and children carrying empty baskets. They had just left the hamlet headed to the market. The crowd must not have regarded the moment to be hostile. None of the soldiers were crouching down, hiding, or seeming threatened. They seemed to be just walking around, then the fire began…
Her face became utterly white with fear when she took a peek after the gunfire stalled. What she saw was more than a teenaged, young woman should ever experience. From the muddy wet banks, she glanced into the road to find her neighbors, friends and their families on the road in piles. They had been executed. She covered her face with her hands when tears began to flow down her cheeks. She slid back down in the muck of the trench, knowing they have nowhere to go...caught in the middle.
Panic pumped through their veins when ship gun fire ravaged deep into the latter end of the trench banks. With nowhere to flee as they hug the banks, they awaited their fate.
Many let out screams of horror, though others looked them dead on with despair, hoping to find favor within the shooter. When an American ship landed uncomfortably close to them, four soldiers rushed toward them, armed with fear in their eyes. One soldier reached the edge with his hand out, shouting, “Come with me!”
No one moved, and no one took a new breath until the young, teenaged woman took the soldier’s hand. He pulled her close to his chest, turned toward the ship and began to rush her to the safety of the helo. 12 more followed.
Within seconds, its blades lifted their precious cargo into the sky and away from danger. Minutes later, they returned and rescued another drenched family from counter fire.
He flew many trips, saving as many people as they could. But with every return, more casualties stood motionless. As he was lifting his last victim from an erie, murky end, they all noticed the horrifying circumstances that were left behind…
In the late 1950’s, the U.S. became involved in a conflict between the North and South Vietnamese governments. Rebellion spread against the South which led the U.S. to send American troops to Vietnam. They were to help suppress the rebellion. By 1964, the U.S. was in a full scale war that was initiated against the VietCong rebels of the South and its supporters in the Communist government of the North.
By 1966, two-thirds of the American people supported the Vietnam War. Within four years into the war, protesters formed a great national movement. Draft refusal spread over the U.S. like wildfire.
During the early 70’s, the population supporting the war now opposed their stand. Resistance groups formed quickly and grew strong in a short period while the front lines extended into Cambodia and Laos before a cease fire could be signed.
Finally, in 1975, when the U.S. troops were recalled, Saigon fell which officially ended the war. 58,000 U.S. troops lost their lives. Vietnamese losses were in the millions, but its civilian population had suffered beyond what words could express…
On March 16, 1968, a company of U.S. infantry entered the village of My Lai. Without a single round of hostile enemy fire, the infantry unit searched out, found, attacked and slaughtered over 500 Vietnamese civilian farmers, villagers and common workers and their families, mostly being women and children.
After heavy losses during the evening prior to this tragic event, U.S. troops which were assigned to an aerial scout unit flew over My Lai working their perimeter and received orders from their platoon leader to strike the area. Unfriendlies covered the area just south of the village. Soldiers from the aircraft fired automatic weapons from its funship into the crowds of people and the trenches where the Vietnamese women were hiding with their children in their arms. Only a few survived this gruesome attack. The platoon’s justification for the orders given was that the VietCong staged the area. U.S. lives were lost due to the sniper fire and booby traps in the area.
When the gunships began to fire into the trenches of women holding their children, the waist-high murky sludge became their grave site.
Their casualties were unbelievable. Over 500 women and children were slaughtered in the road and trenches with 120 of more under the age of 5. A sad ending in a war that cost everyone more than it was worth. Is a war really worth the cost of its casualties? I would have to say NO!"

I am learning about what our lives were like before. I am even learning to speak and read my own language. The scroll is in a Tibetan script, so I am learning to read that as well.
I grew up empty of culture and religion. I am learning them now. I am doing this for the future of our people and particularly my children. Maybe even some day we can go back, although considering that they killed all of our people who stayed behind, we probably won’t. We have a good life and freedom here; no one is trying to kill us because of our religion or ethnicity. We are happy here. Yes, I do believe we will stay.
Even so, it would be nice to visit our ancestral farm to work the soil and smell the scents of the land. How can I be so homesick when I do not even remember anything at all about my homeland from personal experience--just secondhand knowledge? My sister and mother knew. Mother would never talk about it and my sister only remembers the soldiers and guns. To this day she freezes up and shakes with terror when she hears someone speaking in Chinese. She won’t speak of it to me, but I think it has something to do with when the soldiers took her and mother. Those were bad days.
We don’t have to worry about starving or clean water. We don’t have to worry about them killing us or worse. We are safe and protected here. Yet is it not the human condition to want what one cannot have?
A homeland, freedom to live in the place of our ancestors without fear. It is good that we came to the U.S., for here we have learned the meaning of freedom. It is bad that we came because we left our people behind to die, and now we are all that remain. Should we have stayed and died with the rest? Or are we doing the right thing by trying to piece back together our culture? Perhaps it would be best if we just started over--would that be a better choice? Whatever I choose, what if I am wrong? What if I make the wrong choice and deprive my children of the life they deserve?
Even so, whatever I choose, I will do my best to the extent of my ability to teach my children where they come from and that they can choose to live however they want. At least they have that choice."

Convicted of numerous counts of murder for the My Lai massacre (it was reported that the lieutenant personally machine-gunned fifty-plus unarmed civilians, including women and children, in a ditch), he was only sentenced to a few years of imprisonment. And then he was pardoned by Nixon.
While I have no pretensions to judge the actions of a platoon under the tortuous stresses of war, I can’t help but judge the callousness of the government’s regard for murder. And being in prison for murder, I can judge for myself. While what I’ve done haunts me, I wonder what haunts the government that put me behind bars. My incarceration was justified, but when the state speaks of justice and morality, I am always dubious and skeptical that they don’t even know what those terms mean."

She felt the gash left by the bullet, which fortunately only grazed her. Her family lay dead around her. Their killers must have believed her dead as well.
Sung Li didn’t understand why she survived. She didn’t understand why God allowed her family to die, but she did believe that God spared her.
Eventually she found herself in Saigon. There she met Charles, who appointed himself as her protector. He listened to her, helped her come to terms with what happened in that ditch, and fell in love with her. He brought her to America.
Now she wondered if he still tried to look after her. Charles always felt that America more and more turned its back on God and that God would send a sign. To him, September 11, 2001 was that sign. Seven years later came the crash of 2008. Still he fretted of America’s lack of faith and feared the coming of 2015. He always pointed out the growing civil unrest, the simmering and anger glorified by the media, and what he perceived as immorality encouraged by the government.
Sung Li gave him a sympathetic ear. She know how quickly a country could dissolve into chaos. In the past year following his death, the news seemed to make the entire world appear to be going mad. What if the call somehow did come from Charles? What if the call portended another even worse financial meltdown, or even another horrendous attack on the nation’s soil?
Impossible. The call had to be only what it appeared--a prank. Yet, the phone call persisted in tormenting her thoughts. Fumbling for the remote, she shut off the TV and sat back in the quiet, lost in her thoughts. Then, while her eyes remained closed, she randomly opened her bible and placed her finger against the page. It was something she’d often seen Charles do.
Opening her eyes, she red the verse from the book of Malachi 3:7 -- “‘Return to Me and I will return to you,’ says the Lord Almighty.”"

Mark encounters us. He’s been hiding in a doghouse and hears someone coming his way. He sees it is Don and I and comes barging out, scaring us to death. Crouching beside the doghouse, Mark shows us his torn shirt and bloody wounds. He tells us it looks worse than it is and he’s okay. Nobody has seen Sonny.
Starting out again, we make it out of the area without any more incidents, to safer streets. From here mark leads us to an apartment building where he knows a friend lives. Fortunately she’s home and agrees to give us a ride to a safe place for the night. It’s a room in an old house that’s used by some local teenagers to get laid in private. We jump in her car and 10 minutes later we’re there. Parking in a back lot we get out, thanking her for her help. Signalling us to follow, Mark leads us down a set of steps into a dark room. He flips on a light as Don and I step inside. We stop abruptly as we see our night’s accommodations.
The room’s about 15 ft x 20 ft with peeling, yellow-ish brown wallpaper; a shit-encrusted, piss-stained, holey carpet; a ceiling so badly stained with long nicotine exposure it’s almost black; and a closed door across from the front door. A sickeningly musky odor permeates the room--a mix of shit and piss (human as well as anima--cat) and adolescent sex. The sex smell is coming from a beat-up, stained mattress in the corner with an assortment of dirty, rat-eaten old blankets and pillows stained with splotchy, yellowish substances strewn across it. There’s no furniture and no windows.
As Don and I are taking this in, Mark’s telling us he’s not staying but will be back in the morning to get us. With these words he’s out the door and gone.
Don and I stay frozen for a long time. Don suddenly starts, looks out the door and back at the scene before us shaking his head. He then walks over to inspect the “lovenest”. I head to the closed door, opening it...I’m immediately bombarded with the rankest odors of shit and piss, and the horror-inspiring sight of what the inside of a port-a-potty would look like after a tornado takes it for a spin. I’m knocked backwards with its intensity. Covering my mouth and nose I think I’m going to puke. Acid rises to the back of my throat making me gag and swallow convulsively. I hurriedly shut the door before something in there tries to come out. I move over to Don hoping he’s having any luck.
He’s standing next to the “lovenest” with his right hand over his mouth and nose. He reaches down picking up a blanket that looks like a pack of hyenas have been using it to rub their asses on. As he lifts it, it starts falling apart like a damp cracker when you try to pick it up. Don turns an alarming shade of green (that I’m afraid I reflect) and drops what’s left of the blanket and bolts out the door. I’m close behind him.
In the back lot, we’re puking our guts out. Finally, still dry-heaving, we stand up and look over at each other. Don wipes his mouth and says, “We’ll never see that f----r again.”
“Yeah,” I return, wiping my own mouth and looking into the night. “I think we shoulda stayed at the Center.”
As it starts to rain, Don looks up dejectedly at the sky, groaning. He walks back into the room mumbling, “I don’t like being on the run.”
“Yeah, me neither,” I say, still looking into the night. I look up into the increasing rain, letting it clean my face. “At least we’re free.” Then I follow Don back inside."

After I wake up I need peace and quiet, and my coffee. Over the years I've stepped into the routine of getting my cup of coffee and taking my dog for a walk. When I lived by the beach we would walk to the water's edge. There I would sit to watch the sunrise over the Atlantic. My dog would be busy doing his dog thing- he had his routine too. When I lived in the country, with my coffee, we would walk the trails in the woods. I would enjoy the trees, birds, fresh air, and my coffee. My dog would sniff every nook and cranny. All in the effort to get my head straight for the day ahead. My walks were my breakfast in a way, my breakfast of solitude and peace. Oh, but on those special occasions or out of pure hunger I'd create myself a big breakfast, with eggs, bacon, and toast. Or, sometimes I would add grits with salt and pepper and a raw egg mixed in. And coffee, no cream, no sugar.
In my later years on Fridays I would meet mom and her husband Mark at their favorite restaurant Cracker Barrel for breakfast. I would wake up extra early to drive ten miles to meet them for the 8am breakfast. Mom and mark, being humans of habit, would always sit at the same table by the big picture window. They would have the same waitress who they knew by name. They even had the menu memorized and every week they would wait patiently for me to read over the numerous breakfast specials. Pancakes, eggs over medium, bacon, hash browns, biscuits with gravy was my favorite. Mom enjoyed pecan pancakes, and Mark had the ham and cheese omelet with hash browns with endless cups of coffee. And I had my coffee too, with no cream, no sugar.
After I would go to their home and sometimes spend the weekend with them. In the mornings, mom and I would sit in the quiet living room eating butter soggy toast and coffee. Mom always saves up a little bit of her toast to share with the dogs. Mark would be at the table eating a bowl of cheerios. He would always ask, ""Eddie, would you like a bowl of Cheerios?"" and I would respond with ""Umm… no thanks Mark.""
I'd answer remembering those little circles of flavorless compressed sawdust particles. After Mark would leave for work, mom and I would sit out on the back patio that overlooks the woods. With a second cup of coffee, I always enjoyed our quality time together.
Now I sit in prison. My grandma passed away years ago. A year and a half ago we lost Timmy to cancer. My mom is really sick and she needs me more than ever. Mark is doing the best he knows how. And, I've had a few different dogs to walk for morning breakfast. Now my morning walk is in a straight line with other prisoners to the prison dining hall. My breakfast is served to me on a cold tray. I don’t get to choose what I eat. The one thing that hasn’t changed is my love for coffee, now instant coffee, no cream, no sugar, but coffee nonetheless.
I once made a bad decision and I'm now paying dearly for it. Funny how things go. Simple things that I used to take for granted, things I didn’t like, things long forgotten are now cherished memories. Life was so simple once. I miss breakfast with Timmy and Grandma. There is no more Captain Kangaroo or Skipper Chuck shows. I miss Navy coffee and going to the base chow hall for the huge egg omelets. What i would give to eat a simple bowl of Cheerios, butter soggy toast, and carnation instant breakfast egg-nog. I miss my breakfast coffee walks with my dogs and early morning breakfast with mom and Mark at our favorite restaurant. Most of all, sitting in the quiet living room sharing toast and coffee with my mom. I miss good coffee, no cream, no sugar."

Breakfast means many different things to many different people. To me, it is a time for bonding, a time to be close to my wife and daughter. It is a time to discuss our goals for the day and talk about our dreams we had the night before. I will always cherish memories of those times, and when I once again am able to sit at the table and have my breakfast with my family, that will be a joy to my heart. A time to create more memories.
So, until then, I will continue to make believe that I am at that table and eating my breakfast of whatever I want it to be, despite what it really is, with my wife and daughter.

They sell Sugar Twin and Sweet & Low in canteen, but to be honest, I hate those. But I need to sweeten my coffee.
And I do buy coffee, Here, at this moment, they sell Keefe Columbian for $3.40 a bag, Keefe Columbian Blend for $2.80 a bag, Maxwell House for $3.05 a bag, Folgers for $6.90 a jar, and Taster’s Choice for $8.90 a bag...but they’re getting rid of Taster's Choice for some no-name brand called “Deep County”, a brand NOBODY asked for, yet this prison insults us and insists it was OUR idea. Idiots.
So, if I don’t drink coffee so much, why am I buying it? And as of the writing of this essay, I got a LOT of coffee. If I drink 2 cups of coffee a day, what I currently have may last me a YEAR! SO...why do I have so much?
Because coffee, I’ve found, is a great icebreaker. It comes in handy when people are down on their “luck” (I don’t believe in luck, I believe in God), and need something as simple as a cup of coffee. Coffee drinkers know that feeling when you take that first sip of coffee… the calmness you get from it. No different here. In stressful times, sometimes a “spot” of coffee helps so much. I don’t drink a lot of coffee, but I know that many do. So, when I can splurge, I buy coffee, sometimes creamer and Hot Cocoa powder, to make blends. For example, I have a bag of Keefe Columbian and Maxwell House Blend. That bag alone can likely last me a month.
Sometimes I buy coffee for certain people. One kid here, Tino, is 22 years old. He’s a good kid, like a little brother to me. He loves coffee, but can’t afford to buy it. So, I try to keep coffee on me; whenever he needs some, I’ll fill a small pill bottle of some, and give it to him. I told him, “When I buy coffee, it’s usually for you.” But I also share with others, while being discreet. I can’t share with everybody, because as you’d imagine, there are people who only take, and never give and some that are never appreciative of what is given to them. Believe me, I’ve learned my lesson of being “too nice.”
Yet, it doesn’t take away from my compassion. I know I can’t drink all this coffee. I’ve got like six Folgers jars full. I like sharing, it makes me feel good. And yeah, next time I go to canteen, I’ll likely get a little more coffee. It’s just good to have in case somebody really needs a cup to start their day, or just to kinda relax.
It’s just my way of trying to help some of the guys here, in the midst of their troubled times.
Just recently, I went out on the yard to take tino some coffee. I took a large pill bottle of coffee (Folgers and Columbian Keefe mix) to give to him on the yard. But he didn’t show. I was kinda disappointed, but while I was on the yard, another guy, Art, came over to talk to me. As we were talking, he was disappointed that he came out to meet somebody who was supposed to GIVE him coffee. Art rarely comes out at night, but he did because somebody was supposed to give him some coffee. I joked about it, saying, “Well, it just so happens I was supposed to GIVE somebody coffee, and they didn’t show...so, by default, YOU get the coffee,” and gave him the pill of coffee I would have given to Tino. Art was very thankful to get it. And I wasn’t worried about Tino, I had plenty to give him next time I saw him. Things kinda worked out well, I had somebody to give coffee to, and the guy needed to get some. This just shows you how coffee is so important to inmates, and how I try to use it to be helpful to others while I am here. It really allows me to be compassionate to those in need."

Braided, permed, straight, curled, bouncy, full, thick, floating, feathered, fettered, nappy, short, long, pixie, styled in any way that fits her mood.
Her beauty might be in a simple feature. A curved or sculpted body. Sometimes hard and muscled, or soft, smooth, or anyway she wants or is. Her face can have a hidden trove of expression. Curves and grins, dimpled smiles. Full, thin lips of delightful jawlines and arches. Drowning in those round, almond, slanted, oval, pools of brown, hazel, blue, green shades of eyes.
As age pushes on, like a train without a brake, rolling downhill tracks, there's a more attractive quality to a woman. One that surpasses any tests of wrinkles found in time. Deep down within her heart, her thoughts, her mind, is the true beautiful river flowing through her actions. A trove of treasure to be measured, counted, stored, spent wisely, and saved. Every hidden beauty studied shows throughout her smile, her rolling eyes, arching eyebrows, things she says, she does, the way she moves, the way her hair flicks, the clothes, and styles she wears. It's in the way she carries on a conversation, presents her simple truth.
I might've found her in the shadows, behind an invisible mask, a veil I should've lifted. My selfish pride, and unrealistic exaggeration of the Adonis I was not, helped me fail to see them all underneath that made up shining shell. Anyone could've been the one to make those breakfasts, if only I’d been paying attention."

It was, as humanitarian psychoanalysts might describe it, ""psychopathic.""
If the question was ""When the bombs hit and your neighbor begs for admittance to your shelter, should you let him in or shoot him instead?"" Yosepf instinctively identified with the latter alternative.
He fantasized about bomb shelters, bunkers, dehydrated food and stockpiled weapons. He pictured the Last Days of plagues, riots, rape, and pillage. The parts of the Bible he read and enjoyed dealt not with a God of Peace and Love, rather with an angry God of Vengeance and Retribution, the God of the Book of Revelations.
He pictured Humanity as being slowly and painfully crushed in the winepress of God's wrath. (Naturally he pictured himself as the Lord Yayweh, and not as a human grape).
As was natural, he grew up to be an introverted, self-absorbed, egotistical individual. He had trouble dealing with hyper social people who expected him to share himself and his wealth.
Specifically, he had problems dealing with women. Sexual frustration was a lifelong concern.
He worked his way through college as a graveyard shift security guard, dealing with as few people as possible. He majored in chemistry because he had read in a pamphlet in high school that chemists usually worked alone in their laboratories.
He got a job straight out of college working as a travelling analytical chemist, consulting for a company that made anti-corrosion additives for refineries and power plants. The work was lucrative and he lived on a company expense account, driving a company car, staying in hotels and motels and eating in restaurants, all on a company card.
In short order, he had saved up enough money to put his survivalist fantasies into action: an underground, concrete bunker on an offshore island. Enough food to last for 10 years. Enough fuel to cook it with. He bought his nitrogen packed, dehydrated food from televangelist Jim Bakker not because he thought it was the best buy (or even the tastiest food) but because he identified with Bakker's paranoid, apocalyptic Christianity.
He chose an island because he reasoned that in the Last Days the mainland would be ravaged by starving desperate mobs of thugs and criminals. He bought a small island about 20 miles off the Texas coast, reasoning that after 10 years, the starving mobs would have died out and civilization would have a chase to reassert itself."

The train won’t last forever and you only get a couple tries before you got to wait on the next one, so I kept trying.
When I finally was able to grab the train and hold on, my body began to fly through the air as my feet left the ground. A scream escaped my body, part fear, part ecstasy.
Never before had I ever experienced a sensation so pure. The wind as it pushed against my body. The vibration in my hands as I gripped onto the side of the train. The strain of my arm muscles as I pulled myself up on the ladder rungs.
As I steadied myself and looked around at the landscape as it flew by, I felt free! I looked back at my friends and they were a million miles away. At that moment, I felt like the only person alive on planet Earth, and to this day whenever I hear a train I remember that moment. I may forget a million other things in life but that moment remains clear in my mind. It was a rush that no drug can ever compare to.
I’m an artist and trains played a pivotal role in my life because it was at the railroad tracks that I learned the art of tagging. Some of my friends stole spray paint so they could huff it, but not me. I stole my spray paint because I learned to use it as a way to express myself. At the time in my mind, I was just creating art. A troubled youth with no outlet to express himself except through his artwork.
I remember I made some masterpieces back then too. I always wonder to this day if there’s a train somewhere with my artwork still on it. Whenever I see a train out my back window, I admire the artwork as it goes by. It’s truly amazing how talented the youth in America are. Next time you’re stopped at a railroad crossing and you see that artwork as it sails by you on that train, take a chance to admire that talent for what it is. A raw expression of troubled youth.
As I write this, I can hear a train go by outside my cell. I’m over a hundred feet away from those tracks but I can still feel the vibration of that rain. Such raw power. A vital life line in American society, those tracks go from coast to coast.
Those tracks remind of freedom …"

It only took so long because I feared losing my family which I did. I have since been raped, harassed, and discriminated against- and so much more. With all the pain I have endured, my only thought had been that there us nothing to be thankful for- until now.
All my life, the only thing I truly desired in life had eluded me. I sought it, but it kept evading my grasp. What is this I speak of? It is love. I am not talking some touchy, feely,sentimental type, but true love. My parents frowned upon public displays of affection, I had not witnessed what it looked like, I only knew it existed., and i needed and wanted it. Just when I thought it was hopeless, and was about to give up, I fell in love with self less, wonderful man who is in love with me as well. He has shown me what love is by his daily actions. He has helped me to see that love is not something we can force, but instead comes naturally and spontaneously. He has helped me realize the beauty I had denied while so many people saw it. He has lifted the veil off my eyes and showed me the beauty in life in all its splendour. And I am so thankful for him. Never before did I imagine I would find something like this, but here it is . granted, I am still a bit rough around the edges, and I am still broken, but with him by my side, and in my life, I will be whole again.

I recall those emotionally charged contests as far more gratifying and energizing than the stoic, philosophical discussion portrayed in the sitcoms for conflict resolution.

What kind of trees they were, he could not say because quite frankly, he did not care what kind of trees they were.
The fact is, he didn’t care about a great many things.
He did not care whether the sun was shining or it was pouring down rain. He did not care whether it was the middle of summer or the dead of winter. He just didn’t care one whit about anything other than what he called “communing with his thoughts.”
Now, while he didn’t care about most things in this world, there was one thing that he absolutely abhorred: people!
He lived his life in as much solitude as was possible for him.
Once every six months, a boat would arrive to restock his supplies. These were days that he absolutely dreaded. If he could’ve managed his survival any other way, he would’ve, just so he wouldn’t have to interact with anyone, ever!
While he never kept track of time, he always somehow knew when the boat was about the arrive. And the moment he awoke this morning he knew that this was the day. It wasn’t long before the drone of a boat’s motor alerted him of their arrival. He lay upon his sleeping pallet hoping, without much conviction, that they might just unload his supplies and leave without disturbing him.
The sounds of men’s voices assaulted his ears, grating on his nerves worse than nails on a chalkboard. Gratefully, though, a stern command silenced them.
He sat up, trying to will what was about to happen not to happen.
Knock. Knock. Knock.
He did not move, pretending not to have heard them. A moment later, though, they came again.
Knock. Knock. Knock.
He released the breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. Rising, he resigned himself to his fate and made his way to the door, but instead of answering it, he simply stood there with his hand on the handle, giving them the chance to give up and leave.
Knock. Knock. Knock.
Twisting the handle, he opened the door just enough to allow him to peer out. Standing there on the other side of the door was a man who, in relation to the Hermit, was a study in contrast.
Whereas the Hermit’s hair was long, greasy, and unkempt; his was short, clean, and impeccably groomed. Whereas the Hermit’s beard matched his hair, the man was clean shaven. And whereas the Hermit apparently wore a series of rags sewn haphazardly together, the man wore a tailor made suit.
His name was Steven and he was the only person allowed to address the Hermit. He stood there holding a simply looking yet extremely complex tablet computer down at his side.
“Greetings sir,” he said in a lovely audible whisper. “We brought you your supplies for the next six months.”
In response, the Hermit simply scowled at him. Truth be told though, he disliked Steven less than any other handler he’s had over the years. Steven always followed the rules of contact to the letter, never conveniently forgetting any of them like some of his past handlers had. And out of all those rules, speaking in a whisper was the most important to the Hermit.
Nodding his head once in acknowledgment, the Hermit tried shutting the door, but Steven anticipated this and slid his foot forward to keep the door from closing.
“I’m sorry sir,” Steven said still in a whisper. “But you have to keep up your end of the bargain.” Placing his free hand against the door, he gently pushed it all the way open. “We provide you with everything you need to live, as well as ensuring you your privacy out here.” He held the tablet computer out to the Hermit and asked, “so what do you have for us?”
Taking the tablet from Steven, his other hand moved almost of its own volition over to the screen, inputting vast amounts of information without even looking at it.
He tried speaking, but all that came out was a gurgle. Clearing his throat, he tried again. “Well, I came up with a way to increase T-cell resiliency, as well as possible cures for those two types of cancer, but I haven’t made much progress on the sustainable cold fusion power generator. So far, I can only keep a terawatt-hour reactor running for two years on a single fuel capsule, so I am not sure if you want me to include that one as well.”
“You know what? You might as well,” Steven told the crazy old genius who was, in fact, the entirety of the Xem Coup Theoretical R and D department, code name: The Hermit. “You never know what might come of it.”"

Yet, I am willing to bet that there are a lot of similarities in our stories. But, the basic answer to the question is that we have thwarted ourselves time and time again throughout our lives. We find clever ways to trick ourselves into thinking what we are doing is okay. We justify it, or find ways to excuse our behavior. We may have even become ingenious enough to delude our entire reality into fitting the lifestyle we are living. And every time we get a break, a chance, an amazing opportunity that tricky little “us” is there to thwart us yet again.
I can only speak to my own truth. I started going to juvenile hall at age twelve. I would spend the eight years following that in and out of juvie, camp, and then the county jail and prison. I have only myself to blame. I had family, counselors, PO’s, lawyers, DA’s, judges, and countless others that offered a myriad of ways out of the life I was living. I just blinded myself to each and every one of those hands that were trying to pull me out of the waters I was drowning in. I’m sure if you take a long hard look at your life you’ll see that you had those other roads provided that you could have gone down.
Unfortunately, we did not. Otherwise we would not be sitting in prison now. For me this ultimately led to the 25 to Life sentence I am currently 13 years into serving. Over those years I honed my ability to thwart myself into an art form. I had almost twenty years of practice put into tricking, lying to, and deceiving myself. It may not have been my only talent, but it became my forte.
Then, through persistent and unconditional love from my family, and from learning and growing as an individual I came to see that I was my own worst enemy. It was not a sudden epiphany but one that dawned on me over time. With this realization came the colliding of my two “selves.” The one that doomed me to failure at every possible turn, and the one that wanted more for my life. As I wrestled with who I was and who I wanted to be I began to thwart the thwarting me. It was not an easy decision to change my life. It should have been but that’s the insanity of the life we lead isn’t it? It went against everything I had believed in for so long. It almost killed me, and I mean that literally. That, however, is a story for another day.
What I’ll close this out telling you, my friends, is that seeing our attempts have been thwarted is the first step in our journey to a better life. The second is knowing that we are the ones who have been thwarting ourselves. As we progress we will not let this excuse our past behavior, but neither will we hold it against our future self. It’s not their fault. It’s the past us that put up with this behavior. But we are of a sound mind now to recognize this self-destructive pattern and put an end to it. I tell you from experience that it is possible, and that you are not alone in your struggle. Just keep striving at being the thwarter, and stop being the thwarted."

“Yes, in fact, I do. I’ve got five kits at the den right now.”
She shook her tail feathers irritably. “Fine, whatever. But I do own several bonnets and shawls. Not for everyday wear - too impractical. It’s for the pictures, of course.”
“Pictures?” The fox stretched, rolling onto his back and staring at her upside-down.
“Yes, pictures for the books.”
“Ah, yes. The famous Mother Goose books.” He flipped onto his belly, paws tucked carefully beneath him. “Would you care to recite one for me?”
“G-good gracious, no,” stuttered the goose, “I haven’t the time.”
“Sure you do - it only takes an hour to get to the party. You could tell me on the way there.” Languidly the fox rose, almost pouncing on the metal handle of the goose’s carrier.
The goose turned her head and gulped, “ Okay, okay, I lied!”
“Knew it,” said the fox and pulled the handle all the way to ground.
It was like she’d been launched from a catapult. “Ahh!”

Again, he felt the uneasy feeling intensifying as he made his way toward the two steps that led to the flat stage. “I know you’re here, haShatan, but the name Yahweh protects me. My messiah Yahshua is my strength,” said Andrew with faith.
“It’s about to start, Brother Andrew. I’ll go inform everyone to make way inside,” said Isaiah, the young volunteer whom Andrew took a liking to over the past few days.
“Thank you, brother. I’ll get ready, said Andrew.
18 minutes later, everyone sat looking at Andrew Yahchanon, waiting for his first words. Andrew stared at the gathering. It was during this time when Andrew would understand his calling and ask himself how could a successful business entrepreneur of two multimillion dollar enterprises now intensely gaze upon a crowd of no less than fifty country-living, free spirited people in a town with a population like a junior college. To Andrew Yahchanon, one word drove his real passion: Truth.
“My name is Andrew Yahchanon. Today is the first day of your Revival. Hopefully, by the seventh day of this week, the absolute Truth I’m bringing will set upon the walls of your hearts, giving birth to a yearning to live for the Heavenly Father. Yahweh is his name.” As Andrew started talking, he began pacing the ends of the flat stage overlooking the people. “To give a little history about me, I walked away from two multimillion dollar businesses I built from the ground up through hard work and perseverance, as most of you business owners can attest to. This was eight years ago. Like mostly everybody in here, I had a veil strapped around my mind’s eye. It was the fact that I wasn’t able to buy anything of satisfaction anymore that I searched for truth.”
Andrew felt the ground shake beneath his shoes. He scanned the people’s faces to see if they had felt it also. They only looked at him with hungry eyes from starved, deprived souls. That uneasy energy was greater than it had ever been. Andrew swallowed, gathered himself and pressed forward.
“Each day I will reveal a Truth about how paganistic customs that has been purposely placed within the world to not only hide our heavenly Father’s and our Savior’s true identity, but keep the veils upon our vision by the Calendar’s holding of holidays to divert our true spiritual worship of our heavenly Father. Yahweh is his name, and praise our only Messiah. Yahshua is his real name. My veil has been ripped off. So I…”
Suddenly, everything slowed to a blur. Everyone’s faces and bodies faded as Andrew noticed “it.” Directly up the aisle standing at the entrance was “it” or him or her. At the moment, “it” was all Andrew could think to name. The unnerving negative energy gerwe thick. They stared unblinkingly. Andrew prayed for strength. He never saw or felt anything like this. Not from the tyrants in his caliber business. This “it” began to walk slowly toward him with a smirk. Andrew tried to look at the people’s faces, but they all looked ahead, not seeming to notice or feel the evil presence of this being.
Dressed in a dark grayish, smoke-colored, ceremonial robe, the skin of “it” seemed to have a glowing hue. Even though the atmosphere held strong satanic vibes, the “it” walking toward Andrew was surprisingly beautiful. So beautiful that Andrew couldn’t determine if “it” was male or female. Andrew’s chest felt tight, his breathing became shallow, and he closed his eyes. As he prayed without ceasing, a stern, small voice echoed in Andrew’s mind: “I will neither leave you nor forsake you. Draw near to me, I will draw near to you. Besides me, Yahweh, there is no other.” With that, Andrew opened his eyes to see the being walking away. “It” then half-turned and gave a wink before walking into a faded image.
Blinking, Andrew’s focus came to reality. Everyone was clapping loudly, some standing. Andrew looked for “it,” not knowing why, and he wondered why people were applauding. Gathering himself, Andrew pressed on, “By the end of your Revival, you will cease celebrating paganized customs purposely placed in religion to keep us from the righteous worship of Yahweh. Starting today with why our Father’s name Yahweh was intentionally removed from all scriptures over 7,000 times…”"

Hand in hand Ray led her down a narrow hallway that was decorated with pictures of family dating back several generations to a wooden door that creaked loudly on its hinges as it opened toward a flight of stairs.
The two of them descended into a brief moment of darkness that was dimly extricated when Ray reached above his head and gave a tug at an aluminium beaded rope that hung from a light fixture. The room was packed full of boxes. Ray went directly to a small box, scooped It up, and continued through the room to another door.
This door gave way to warm rays that penetrated the dimly lit basement and caused Makayla to shield her eyes with her forearm. Ray and Makayla stepped out into the backyard. Ray knelt down on one knee and opened the box, as Makayla took a wooden flute decorated in leather strips and nature beads. With both hands Makayla cradled the flute as if the mahogany used to craft the instrument was actually glass.
After a few seconds of silence she looked up from the flute bewildered and asked, “What Is it papa?”
“Your grandmother’s most prized possession. It’s a flute. Whenever life got to be too much and she was feeling hurt or lost she’d pull this out and play it. According to her it would summon the spirits of her ancestors who would provide her with healing or guidance.”
“Spirits? You mean like ghosts?”
“I guess you could say that.”
“I don’t like ghosts papa, they scare me.”
“Oh angel, these ain’t no evil spirits. They’re made of the same stuff as you. They’re the ones who lived before us. They’re the ones that made you who you are today.”
“Yeah? Still sounds kinda scary though. Ain’t they dead?”
“I know that this doesn't make much sense to you right now but a day will come that you’ll be able to understand. Just always keep in mind that it ain’t the dead you should worry over. It ain’t them you should fear my child, but the living.”"

Not long after they took the pill, their blood pressure was examined, and It had indeed increased. Yet the pill was actually candy.
In another case a patient went to see his doctor because he had a cold. He had an x-ray and was diagnosed with lung cancer. After hearing the news, his condition worsened to the point where he could barely get out of bed. A week later, the hospital called him and apologized for their mistake. They told him that after reexamining the x-ray, they had found that he only had an infection and didn’t have lung cancer. He felt better right away!

“He jus’ packed up some clothes and he was on his way,” Grandma said. “It near ‘bout broke poor Libby’s heart! And Marion? Why, I don’t believe he ever go quite over it.”
That was 1927. For over two years nobody heard a word from Cletus.
“We didn’t none of us even know where he was!” Grandma exclaimed. “Not nary a letter or even a postcard to let anybody know a thing!”
October of 1929 saw the infamous crash of the stock market and the collapse of Wall Street. Banks failed, fortunes were wiped out, and thousands lost jobs as an estimated 10 million were out of work In just days. By the summer of 1930 the good folk of Lake Swamp realized their blessing of living on the fertile farmland of the South Carolina low country. Cletus, however, had not been as fortunate.
“We all knew that things were bad up north,” Grandma said sadly. “Ever’body had heard of the bread-lines, ‘Hoovervilles,’ and the closed banks. But when Cletus pulled up to Marion’s barbershop In a brand spanking new 1929 Packard, well, we all thought that Cletus had surely made his fortune.”
It would have been easy to assume. The 1929 Packard was priced, fully loaded as Cletus’ was, at around 6,000.00. Not a lot by today’s standards but this was 1930, and six grand would buy a new home! A very nice new home at that. So when the farmers In Marion’s barbershop heard the unfamiliar “ugga-ugga” of a car horn, they all stepped outside and saw a rather “dandified” Cletus alight from the car.
“Oh my, but he was dressed to kill,” Grandma shook her head. “Cletus always was a good-looking boy, but gussied up In them city clothes, we all just’ knew that Cletus was as rich as Midas.”
What the folks of Lake Swamp didn’t know was that Cletus’ car was not even his own, but belonged to the flimflam mobster that Cletus had worked for. He had coasted into town on fumes with only the clothes on his back, and hadn’t eaten in nearly a week! Lake Swamp was the only place that Cletus could come to and have a square meal and a roof over his head. But no one knew this as Cletus walked up to his father and, as tears welled In Marion’s eyes, the two embraced. Such demonstrations of familial affection were rare among stoic farm folk. But Cletus was Marion and Libby’s only son and he had been away for a while, so it was to be expected.
“Talk about killing the fatted calf!” Grandma exclaimed. “Lordy, Libby flew in and started a’ cooking, while Marion commenced to invite pert near the whole county! It was gonna be one hootenanny, let me tell you!”
Forgotten were the months that no one had heard a word from Cletus. He was home and by all appearances, he was rich. Marion asked everyone to come and see his “city slicker son” and get a ride in the expensive Packard. Folks flocked to Marion and Libby’s house for a peek at what had become of Cletus. Tables were set up outside under the Magnolias to accommodate the crowd as food and Marion’s own moonshine flowed. Cletus was busy taking anyone who wanted for a ride around the county in his shiny automobiles.
“It was a fine affair,” Grandma said. “Ever’body came and you could just see the pride and joy on Marion and Libby’s faces as folks glad-handed and back slapped Cletus as If he’d never even left.”
Noticing Cletus’ lack of belongings other than the clothes he was wearing, and of course the Packard, my Grandpa David, the sheriff of Darlington County, remarked, “You travel a mite light there, dontcha cons?”
Cletus had no ready answer, but of course Marion came to his rescue, “Oh well, now, David, the boy was jus’ in a hurry to get home. It’s been a good long while.” Grandpa David didn’t respond, but kept silent council.
“Somethin’ jus’ ain’t right,” Grandpa David remarked that night to Grandma. “Don’t rightly know what, but there’s jus’ a thorn In my craw that’s tellin’ me that all is not what it appears with that boy.” Grandpa David didn’t get to be sheriff for no reason at all!
For the next week or so, Cletus made the rounds all over Lake Swamp, Timmonsville, and even to Florence and Darlington. Now, everybody In the county knew and respected both Marion and Libby. Their name was good as gold. Cletus knew this and everywhere he went, he made purchases that when it came to paying for, he had “absentmindedly” left his wallet back In Lake Swamp. All the merchants, without exception, would simply nod, smile and say “No problem Cletus! Jus’ take care of it next time you’re passing by.” Word had spread of Cletus’ “fortune” and folks just knew he was good for it.
Questions started being asked when Cletus attempted to sell his Packard to Sansbury Motor Company in Darlington. “Plug” Sandsbury had known Grandpa David and Marion for all their lives. They hunted, fished, and drank “shine” together, and Plug wouldn’t let another barber within twenty feet of his hair. It just had to be Marion.
“Plug was a big supporter of David ever’ time an election came ‘round; he was a ‘yellow-dog’ Democrat for sure,” Grandma insisted.
Cletus had no paperwork for the Packard, and couldn’t vouchsafe he was, in fact, the actual owner. Not to mention that he was only trying to get pennies on the dollar for an automobile that precious few people could even think about buying during the Great Depression. Plug put Cletus off, telling him he was interested but to give him a few days to raise the cash. Cletus accepted this and Plug immediately went to see Grandpa David.
Apparently, had run up quite a few bills around the area, ranging from clothing to gasoline. Merchants knew Marion, so of course they just figured that the credit was good. When Plug came to see Grandpa David and told him of Cletus’ attempt to sell the Packard but having no proof of ownership, Grandpa David had his suspicions were confirmed.
“David t’weren’t happy about being right at all, I can tell you that,” Grandma said sadly. “He just’ knew it was gonna break poor ol’ Marion and Libby’s hearts, that’s for sure.”
Grandpa David had Plug to stick with his story about needing a few days to raise the cash that Cletus was wanting and to keep it between them. In the meantime, Grandpa took it upon himself to visit all the various businesses where Cletus had ran up a tab. By today’s standards, it didn’t amount to much, but in 1930 it represented more than many, if not most, people earned In a year of honest labor. Next came a private one-on-one visit with Cletus.
“David said when he asked Cletus to take a little ride with him, why that boy looked like he’d seen a haint!” Grandma remarked, shaking her head. “I ‘spect Cletus knew the jig was up!”
Cletus knew all right. Before Grandpa David could even get the words out, he was bawling and telling the whole sordid tale. It seems Cletus had went to Boston and fell in with huckers in the mob and was running numbers for them. When the Boston police became wise to the con men, they hopped the next train out, leaving poor bumpkin Cletus literally holding the bag. Cletus didn’t know what to do but get in the Packard and head south. With no money, no clothing, and little hope, Cletus figured that neither the police nor the mob would come looking in rural South Carolina.
“David never did believe much In banks,” according to Grandma. “He had this big ol’ safe that he kept his money in.”
A good thing too, as the Farmers and Merchants Bank of Timmonsville went belly-up like all the rest. Dipping into his savings, Grandpa David took out sufficient funds to settle all of Cletus’ bills.
“We weren’t rich by no means,” Grandma insisted, “but David had always had a way 'bout him for puttin’ back a bit of money here and there, so there was some. He jus’ couldn’t abide seeing Marion and Libby get all torn-up due to Cletus.”
Cletus had been trying to amass enough money to book passage on a steamer for Venezuela where he planned to work In the new oil industry there. Grandpa David paid for his ticket as well. When Cletus told Marion and Libby that he was South America bound, they seemed to take it in stride. No word of his debts and criminal exploits ever reached them.
“I expect that both Marion and Libby knew in their hearts that Cletus’ visit was only temporary,” Grandma said.
The Packard posed a problem. It had ties to the Boston mob, after all, so It wouldn’t do to let an unsuspecting buyer wind up with “cement shoes” for just happening to be behind the wheel of a mobster’s car! Grandpa David made arrangements with the Pacific and Orient ship captain down in Savannah where Cletus was boarding for Caracas. Last but not least, Grandpa David wired the Boston police to let them know that Cletus left the country and In all likelihood would not be returning. This was just fine with the Bostonians as they had their own problems fighting the bootleggers trying to get around Prohibition. Grandpa exacted a promise from Cletus In return for bailing him out that he’d write weekly to Marion and Libby.
“It was as big a send-off as a body could get’” Grandma said. “Everyone gathered at Marion and Libby’s to see Cletus leave for Savannah and on to South America.”
No one ever knew what became of the gangsters that left Cletus holding the bag In Boston. But soon after his departure, photos and letters began to arrive to Marion and Libby, as well as Grandpa David that showed a tanned, smiling Cletus posing with the Packard amidst Venezuelan workers in front of an oil rig."

I know this is not your calling son.” The director said before he could answer, “You, sir are a best-boy, a gaffer and unlike the ladies, you have no formal actor’s training. But-I know you can understand instructions, right?” Troy’s mouth opened to respond but David’s index finger held in the symbolic manner in front of his face to mean ‘hold that thought’. ‘I shouldn’t be here right now!’ David thought to himself. ‘I should be anywhere but here, this thing should have wrapped days ago!’ He pondered his streak of bad luck. What began as a simple, straightforward 30 second commercial shoot for the national eyewear chain Vision Place, was now a tragic comedy which might soon place David in the hospital attached to a cardiac monitor.
The project, Seeing Double? It was scheduled to start and wrap shooting in a single day. That was 4 days ago. The lead male actor: Johann Wetton Endicott, was in a hospital lying in a coma. One hour prior to the call, the perfectly sculpted and seasoned actor had his face buried in a script for a different project while walking to what he felt would be nothing more than a two take effort on his part. In what one witness described as a homage to a Bugs Bunny cartoon, a seemingly secured bundle of roofing material 3 stories above Endicott’s fabulous face gave way. Gravity obeyed its unbreakable law and seconds later the talent lay unconscious as sirens wailed in the distance.
Yesterday, in his office, David met with the project’s sponsor who also happened to be Troy’s uncle. The director took a long pull on his bourbon enhanced cup of coffee. He knew what was coming. “He’s a natural! I promise you Davey boy, he just needs a break and well, here you go right?” David moaned a sound that came off as a half hearted refusal. “C’mon Hyde, “ the sponsor pressed on, “as a favor to me. One I know you won’t regret!”
David had nothing but regret. He wanted nothing more than this mountain of a mishap to be over with. He was 2 days late for an assistant director’s gig in LA. The unfortunate circumstances and David’s reputation bought him a reprieve, but he needed to wrap now- today!
“OK Troy, “ he said calmly. “You can do it.” He looked at the talent as he coached him again. “Just ever so slight, look at Lana as you go by, subtle - you do know what I mean by subtle, right?”
Troy nodded looking like a bobble head doll. David thought Troy had a better chance of flying than acting but “here we go again” he thought.
“Ok places!” David barked into the megaphone. “This is it people- this is the one!” “My god, please…” he said under his breath as he passed the loud-speaker to his assistant and sat back in his chair.
“Quiet, please!” The assistant pleaded. “Seeing Double? Take 28 - and…”"

Read your Bible from front to back and find me one character who is not a criminal, Jesus included.
Don’t adjust the Bible to fit your lifestyles. Don’t adjust it to make you feel better about yourself. The Bible does not explain everything. It does not have all the answers that your Sunday school teacher taught you. I’m sorry to believe in myself and not the Bible.
Have I shook you a little? If you believe the Bible and all it says, then why don’t you obey it? Why don’t you love everyone and lend to all those in need? Oh what hate you have for the people in prison. Thou of little faith.
The Bible, the words you believe in, were written and based upon the lives of criminals. I have not come to turn brothers against fathers or mothers against daughters as Jesus did. I am a man of true love who desires peace and the restoration of relationships of people kind.
Jesus says you can do all things through him. I tell you today out of true faith in myself, You, child, can do all things if you believe in yourself. Look at our world, where do you think all this destruction stems from? I tell you the truth, it is because of man made religions.
We have lost faith in ourselves and in each other because of religious teachings. Especially the Bible who says you can do whatever you want because you will be forgiven. Lie, cheat, steal, kill, it doesn’t matter, you are forgiven. But you do not forgive even when your religion commands you to.
I also got news for you, God was a God of love, forgiveness, healing, compassion, way before the New Testament was written. You can throw a man in prison for the rest of his life with no mercy and no conscience because God will take care of it. I’m sorry to tell you that goes against the Bible.
The Bible preaches forgiveness, love. Don’t forget those in prison; don’t just love those who love you but love everyone, even your enemies. Oh… that’s too hard. “I’ll just put that to the side, God will understand,” but that’s not what the Bible says. God says, “If you do not forgive others, God will not forgive you.”
Our country needs restoration, our country needs hope, it needs each other, needs you. We have to build each other up. Love each other. Create a foundation for our children. So our children can grow up in a peaceful, loving world.
We not only need to have more respect for others but most importantly we need to have more respect for ourselves, our bodies, our futures. How can we respect others if we can’t respect ourselves!
Religion is a fog that we all must emerge from. These are my thoughts and beliefs, you do not have to believe in what I am telling you obviously. But once you get out (emerge from) that fog (religion) and start putting faith back in yourselves, others, and the world around you then you will be able to stand on something solid.
You won’t have to worry about your prayers going unanswered, question your faith, or whether or not God loves you. I tell you today, this is the truth, I love you. How can I love someone I don’t know? Because you are a human being, and it is in my nature to love you. You are very special, strong, and unique.
That is why I love you. And if you let go of religion and grasp mankind as a whole you will also love your neighbor because he/she is a person and deserves to be loved and treated with kindness and compassion."

A lot of people find themselves too high on the totem pole. Just like the show The Jeffersons. What started out as a small person soon forgot the lower people and forget where they came from. Sooner or later in life the same person who forgets this will find themselves to fall from power.
We talked for about an hour, he even told me that the day I called. The person he had In his office was In the higher upper class. They were on the way out for lunch with a few other clients, and I thanked him for his concern, letting him know I wasn’t mad at him, that we could still get together. He also agreed to that.
I saw him a couple of times over the next three years. I’m glad that my mind had never been in that field. After seeing how shallow he looked; bags under his eyes. His hair had thinned and turned gray and he looked as if sleep was not his friend anymore. Worry lines had formed over his forehead. Even his face had wrinkles upon wrinkles.
There was something going on that had to be fixed. Not everyone will step in and help a friend in need. He was going down the drain like so many before. Not this fellow he was my friend. I was taught a friend Is for life even under the circumstances that change a persons way of thinking.
We both sat and talked in a cafe out of the way. That was when he told me the truth. His wife had started to spend money he didn’t have. The one thing that hurts the most was that she was seeing someone else and the late night phone calls.
All I could do was listen to him pour out his heart, I was his friend, and a lot cheaper than any “psychiatrist.” Some things in life hurt, and the human mind can deal with It. In his case he found out what a tricky business politics is for real."

Me being me, I didn’t care for a high school diploma and everyday, I just wanted that stupid bell to ring so I could go running wild in the concrete jungle.
Even though my last year went by faster than the others, I still didn’t look forward to finishing; nothing there caught my attention besides the girls.
Everyday after four, I would hit the gym, selling drugs, and when night came by, it was time for a robbery. The hooking up with women happened in the times in between. Occasionally, my friends and I would get into fights with other groups, but that was nothing new with people from my barrio (neighborhood).
The only one who talked any sense in me was my uncle and we had planned to go take a vocational trade together at the local community college. Unfortunately, I did not make it nor did I graduate my senior year. All the good times came to a halt the minute I got caught in a stolen SUV by a swarm of police officers. I almost stayed out for seven months.
This seemed like a long time compared to the 14 years I’ve done in the Institute of Corrections. Now, I see how fast, how short time really is. Little cousins now have families and established households- nephews and nieces going to the same schools that I went to. Talking about dances, Iphones, or having just graduated. I missed out on the things that I will never experience with them, when I should of been there for them in their youth while their fathers were locked up.
It seems like every five years that passes, time speeds up its flow and I hear a lot of people talk about how when they get out, they’re gonna catch up with time. It’s sad because that’s just an illusion- we can’t catch what’s gone. All one can do upon release, is catch and live in the moment.
Every year, there’s people here who are committing suicide or attempting, some are losing it mentally, some get called to the Chaplain’s office to hear about a dead relative. There’s a lot of hate and sorrow here and the staff could care less.
I learned years ago that one should be patient because an instant reaction to the first thought that pops inside your head can have drastic results that you may not be ready for/ or you may not want. A lot of the time, what one gets incarcerated for is not worth the time spent.
It took me a while to learn certain teachings that I used to not believe in or that I would cast aside, but the main thing I have learned is to not worry about the problem but to know how you are gonna move forward in a better, more prosperous way.
LIfe’s too short to cry over the petty things. There’s bigger things to fix and life is bigger than me and you. We can either build one another up, or fall down faster than a blink of an eye."

She ran away at 13. And smashed my mother in the face with a coka cola bottle. Mother forgave her. At 17 she was pregnant and Mom let her stay at home and she stole money and jewelry. Then later she called H.R.S. on my mother claiming that my mom was molesting my little brothers. Then she did the same to two of my aunts and uncle and me. Fortunately, nothing came of either accusation.
Her name among the family is “the evil one” I have letters from family to verify this. She is the embodiment of evil. She is the kind of woman whom if she doesn’t get her way with you, she will make life difficult for you. The things she do is quite inventive. She may somehow get ahold of your info and put bills or credit cards in your name. She may play nice until you let her borrow something expensive then she’ll claim she lost it or that you owe her it.

So she told her cousin that she could bring her furniture to her house and that she could stay there until she get her a place.

The woman looked at me in a pleading manner and asked if I could do something. I told her I couldn’t do anything. And she left with unshed tears in her eyes and the look of unbridled hatred. I never saw the cousin again.
Sam is the forgiving type. The evil one has done much wrong to Sam, too much to fill these pages. However, Sam has always forgiven her until the summer of 2015.
Sam goes home to Detroit every year up until this point. Although Sam returns broke and a little miserable with every visit, she in her happy enthusiasm stays with the evil one every time she visit.
This time however was bad.
The evil one has a little get-together at her house and invited a few old and new associates. Then she started bad mouthing Sam. Sam defended herself and bad mouthed her back. Except the Sam bad mouthed her with truth, the evil one got upset, she can cry at will, and swung on Sam hitting her in the face in front of everyone. Sam not being a fighter or a cryer, went and packed her things and put them in her rental car. Sam did not return.
Upon returning to California, Sam changed all of her numbers and social media accounts. And the evil one was trying to find avenues to apologize at first and then with no response from Sam, she used harassment. None worked and Sam finally found a reason not to forgive.
Sam was the last link the evil one had to our family. And she messed that up with her own selfish stupidity.
The evil one, due to the fact that she has the ability to cry at will, many naive people believe her stories and accusations. The strange thing is, with all the many accusations of child abuse and rape, of her and her two daughters, no one has been to court or prison. No one. Everything dissolved into nothing but hatred towards her.
Sisters.
Many may have one or some. And they all come in all shapes, sizes, and personalities. Yet mine are at the extreme of both ends of the good and evil spectrum. And truth be told I only love one of my sisters. And the other, I feel nothing."

They need back-up speakers, too, for when they get off-track, begin interrupting their opponent too frequently, or run out of ideas and simply begin repeating themselves, trying to derail the debate and run the clock. When this happens, the TV debate practitioner exacts a penalty. Too much bellowing gets the volume of your mic turned down. Too many interruptions gets your mic shut off and your back-up speaker gets the next question to answer. Obvious attempts to go south, sideways, distract, and derail gets you a split screen and no sound while your opponent gets extra time. Telling lies or disparaging your opponent gets you the worst sanction of all. The debate practitioner puts a commercial box over the top of the offender’s face, selling soap, pizza, or even condoms. Since the TV people get their commercial now, this can extend the debate.
These suggestions may seem more amusing than serious, but they do provide a framework for improving the effectiveness of debates. They make it more entertaining to watch, certainly. These rules would indeed sidetrack and cut out a major portion of the predatory nonsense that infects most TV debates, particularly political bullshit theatre, if all broadcasters adopt them. Politicians want to sell their agendas. So do business groups, unions, political candidates, cops, lawyers, and every other type of expert, consultant, paid talking head, or special interest group. Television is the medium that they prefer to use that allows them to sell their ideas to the most interested viewers at once. This makes their ideas, like advertising, and their television time like commercials. They should pay for our time spent watching this crap by agreeing or submitting to new rules that make it less crap, or at least more entertaining. More entertainment and less crap would lure more of an audience and stop many of us from turning the shit off. More points would get made. These points would be of a higher quality.

There was no choice. I had to wear the pants.
Fortunately, I got back to the prison at night, so there was no one around to view me wearing the clown pants. That is, except for certain staff members in the Special Housing Unit, the place where I work. When you come to the prison after working hours, the SHU is where they stash you until the next day.. They did so enjoy teasing me. One sergeant said, “You look mighty cute in them dungarees, missy”. Har-de-har-har. Such comedians they are.
The next day another sergeant told me the pants were just wrong on me. Oh thank you, thank you! I'll take validation where I can find it. She gave me a light green SHU dress to wear to the laundry. I was on my way there. Little did I know what awaited me.
The laundry officer informed me that my dresses were not in storage, that there was a new spring fashion line and I was going to be one of the first lucky recipients. I was expecting a redux of my former dresses. I was disappointed. I put it on. Well, not exactly. I had to squirm into it. They presented me with an allegedly one-size-fits-all tube. Now, I am not a thin person, but also not fat. I do possess breasts, belly, butt, and thights. However, this dress was built to accommodate starving people living in developing world countries.     Holding my breath and giving the laundry officer my narrow blue-eyed gaze, I say, “Are you sure you want me to wear this?” as I look at myself in the mirror. “What’s the problem?” the officer asked, looking me over in a bored manner. I stared at myself in the mirror. “Well, I’m not a snake. How am I supposed to walk in this thing?” I asked. She looked me up and down again and replied, “Guess you’ll have to figure that out.''
Now I wear dresses because I like to dress modestly and I have a religious dress pass to accommodate this. As I walked back to the dorm, all was not well in LaFleur Land. For one thing, everything on my body that was accustomed to a wide range of free movement was now heavily constrained and… gasp... Wriggling.
The dress was singing chicky-wow-chicky-wow-chicky-wow-wow-wow, sort of like the soundtrack to a 70s porn flick. That is when the wolf whistle came out of nowhere. One of my thuggy clients from the law library had caught sight of me and decided to let loose. Another old woman serenaded me with the song Love for Sale. How is it that these people were so funny before, but now so much now?
After a day of shallow breathing and more ribald comments from my fellow inmates I decided to finish this once and for all. The next morning, I went to the lecherous senior official. He could see me coming from a mile away five pounds of sausage in a three pound casing, strutting down the compound. All the body parts were fighting for space like pigs fighting under a blanket.
After looking me up and down twice, he said, “You’ve got a problem”. Then, he sent me back to the laundry, where they proceeded to issue me four dresses of the older variety. Turns out the dresses had not been thrown away. Instead, they had been cut down the center and repurposed as night robes.
Thankfully, all is well in Camp Prisoney Land. I can breathe again and nothing is singing chicky-wow-chicky-wow-chicky-wow-wow-wow."

That lasted until age 31 when my employer transferred me to their new facility in the desert southwest.
A chance grocery store meeting brought Pam into my life. This was a very strange situation. Although Pam was definitely attractive enough, there was no immediate romantic or “hot-to-trot” spark between us. However, we immediately discovered a long ignored shared interest in square dancing. Together with other friends we started attending “refresher lessons” with a local square dance club. Still no archetypical romantic stirrings, though “family” outings with Pam’s two teenage songs to their sporting events, picnics, dinners, etc., were becoming commonplace. We were the very best of friends. The spark that ignited our “romantic” flame was a male friend of mine asking if I would mind his asking Pam out for a date. His perception was that Pam and I were a “couple.” I was stunned speechless! That night Pam and I had a very serious, long conversation about our relationship. What we discovered is that both of us were repressing our libido due to past experience with the lust/love conflict, as well as with that of divorce. Pam’s additional concern was that her boys made her a “packaged deal.” The hurdle of teen sons had been cleared early on due to our “family” outings. The boys and I had an excellent understanding of each other as well as our respective roles in a family unit. The wedding, like everything else in our relationship, was a simple ceremony in our living room with a minister friend officiating and, beside Pam’s sons, only six of our closest friends in attendance. A beautiful daughter joined us fourteen months later and a handsome son eighteen months thereafter. This joyous fairytale does not, however, have a happy ending because Pam died of breast cancer four days after our seventh wedding anniversary.
Weddings? Yeah- been there, done that. For me that cliche “the third time's the charm” is too true to contemplate. Will there be a fourth? Not likely; Pam was that proverbial “one-in-a-million.” Plus, at my age, why bother."

A gray wolf (they’re what’s in the photo) would be my spirit animal: My drawing of one was in the winter 2019 P.E. Newsletter!
Alas, there are no wolves in my tame yard. But looking out the window of my seg. Cell , I see a chipmunk hole. With no TV to watch, I often watch the chipmunk who lives in that hole. S/he is hilarious and disgustingly cute! (who didn’t hate those old chipmunk cartoons “Alvin!”, “Simon!” and “Theodore!”?)
My hand could crush their puny bodies like...just, it’d be gross. They’re that small! Their brains can’t be bigger than the tip of my pinkie, yet they exhibit playful, funny behavior like young kids.
For example, earlier today “chip” (the one with a burrow under my window) was chasing another one around. Then, for no apparent reason, the chased chipmunk flopped, in the grass, laying still as a rug, while Chip zigged and zagged, then stopped and stood up, chest heaving from his/her antics.
It’s like he (only boys do weird shit like that) was asking me what I thought about the show.
My interpretation of Chip’s antics are, I’m sure, nought but proof of my human narcissism: people tend to think we are superior to all animals, not animals ourselves.
It’s amusing when you consider the Jerry Springer Show, and just about every politician you can think of. Look at the nearest prison guard. F-ing animals dude!
But other animals have the same superior attitude, except for many domestic dogs, which have half the brain size of wolves (you gotta be smarter to survive in the wild) and have been bred to be “bitchy!.” Look at birds though; struttin’ around all fancy - a mere robin is very proud of his/her robinness: “Bitch, I’m a robin; I eat worms and I like it! My eggs are azure blue, bitch - you don’t even have shelled eggs. And what’s up with hair, you people monkeys - I got feathers, rockin’ ‘em too! And check out my whistle - the girls love this shit!”
Every animal is arrogant about itself. I’m sure that even tortoises are proud to be tortoises, looking at the rest of us as being lost in the sauce. “I just eat plants and fruit. I don’t even wash, and I smell good. I don’t wipe my ass, just drag it on the ground. Sex, what!? These girls can’t outrak me - they wish they could, when I flop out this big ol’ turtle hammer.”
Yeah, I could tell ya’ some stories about animals I happen to be around.
Anyway, I wish I could catch Chip and force him to be my friend. “I would hug him, squeeze him, and stroke his soft fur.”"

But then another appeared like an angel and nothing less than. He was taller, rich and kinder, appearing to be, as if.
How do you walk away from true love when another love comes along? How can love compare against love? This is how a person becomes guilty yet pleads innocent of an affair. It may be love vs. true love.
I gave her hugs and kisses every day. I did everything a lover should do. Could I have done more? There can always be more.
Then came along more and Mr. More, well, was beautiful enough to garner anyone’s love. Anyone who gives more on top of love has to be an angel.
But there is no account where it is feasible for one to love an angel. Every time one encounters an angel, one falls down. One is awed so much one wants to worship and love this Holy. The true angel always says, “Get up, I’m not the one, I’m not what you’re looking for.” So I have mercy on the one who’s willing to contemplate bending knees before that fallen angel.
Because the false angel isn’t going to say, “Get up. Fooled ya.” Is there no pity that we’re short Jesus and likely to succumb to temptation.
So when she asked for forgiveness (somehow she realized he’s no angel), I told her I’m no angel. She could save her apologies. What good are they to me? It’s of no value and no one gives anything of value unless it’s for charity away.
I don’t want charity like that. I always believed that when a person apologizes, it’s mostly for their own elevation, when it’s sincere.
Even though I said I don’t care for apologies, I rather assure you won’t have to apologize again."

You don’t feel as much anger, fear, or self-consciousness. You don’t feel resentment toward people. Things still happen that you don’t want to happen, but they don’t seem to touch you as much. They can’t reach back to where you are because you are drifted behind the these are actual experiences, not merely something you were told about. It’s just what naturally happens when you let go of the lower vibrations of your being. You drift in and up to the deeper vibrations.
Where are you going? Even if you have no basis for understanding what is happening to you, you are still having the undeniable experience of going somewhere. What you begin to feel is that you are going into your spiritual being. As you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy.
What does it feel like to identify more with spirit than with form? You used to walk around feeling anxiety and tension; now you walk around feeling love. You just feel love for no reason. Your backdrop is love, openness, beauty, and appreciation. You don’t have to make yourself feel that way; that is how spirit feels. If you were asked how the body normally feels, you might say that ‘t;s generally uncomfortable about one thing or another. How about the psyche? If you were being totally honest, you’d probably say that it’s generally full of complaints and fears. How does spirit normally feel? It always feels good. It always feels high. It always feels open and light.
Because of this, you naturally begin to center more and more on the spiritual part of your being. You do this not by reaching for spirit, but by letting go of the rest. There is no other way. The personal self cannot touch spirit; you must release the personal self. As you realize it, you drift back. As you go further back, you get higher. You get higher in vibration and higher in the amount of love and lightness that you feel. You just begin to soar. This happens in an ever-increasing, continuous progression."

Actually, Pammy, I guess we can stop a stranger since my whore jacket, in all its glamour, if offset by the fact that you’re dressed like Carol fucking Brady,” she retorted, applying her own twisted logic, “Jeez girlfriend, where’d you find that dress?” She reached over and pinched my arm.
“Owww, slut, I’ll have you know this dress is the absolute pinnacle of Mount Cool. Besides, it’s reeeaally comfortable,” I defended my current fashion choice. Truthfully, I was beginning to feel a little self-conscious. Looking at her jean jacket made me feel a little better about my own choices.
“Oh shit mama, here comes Dumbass Danny,” Rhonda said as she stamped her half smoked butt into the sidewalk.
I looked up and sure enough, here came Danny Feuderschein, Dumbass Danny when he couldn’t hear us, and sometimes when he could. We all called Danny that because he was essentially a nothing man. He wasn’t cool. He wasn’t smart. He wasn’t handsome or charming, or graceful, or strong, or any other adjective I could think of that’s used to describe human beings in a positive manner. He looked like all the little Rascals rolled into one. If Alfalfa had Spanky’s weight, Buckwheat’s hair, and Froggy’s glasses, all the while dressing like a character in a Howdy Doody rerun, that was Dumbass Danny. He had a huge crush on me, though I’d been careful not to encourage him.
“Heeey Danny,” Rhonda and I both called at once, waving to him.
As he approached, I began to rummage inside my huge purse for my Polaroid. My parents had bought me the new Kodak 220’s for my birthday. It was the cutting edge of instant photography in 1971.
Rhonda threw an arm around Danny’s shoulders and gave him a peck on the neck, making him blush until it looked like his ears might catch fire. She didn’t do this out of friendship or affection. No one gave a flying shit about Dumbass Danny. She did it to watch his ears turn red. Such a mean bitch. I smiled just thinking about it. Guess I was a mean bitch too.
“Look here Danny boy. Me and my girl Pammy, we need our picture taken, and I think you’re just the man for the job,” Rhonda said in mock seriousness.
“Yeah Danny, how bout it,” I added. “Maybe if you help us out, Rhonda will pull her jacket the rest of the way up and give ya’ a look,” I teased.
Rhonda punched me in the arm, saying “Fat fucking chance, girl. Now stop before he has a stroke or something.”
“So Danny, what do ya’ say?” That was me. I batted my lashes at him for good measure.
“W-well, O-OK Pammy, y-you know I-I’d do it for y-you,” Danny stammered, intimidated almost into a urine stain by us two outgoing girls who hadn’t a care in the world and our whole future ahead of us. After two explanations and three tries, I was rewarded with the picture of me and my best friend Rhonda. It’s been my favorite always.
As I’ve looked back on it, I’ve realized why it was my favorite. Soon after it was taken, my carefree days were over. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, I found I did have a care in the world. Lots of growing up began to happen, and things were never the same again, never better than the day with my best friend Rhonda. December 12th 1971."

Obedient to his “law”


Faithful to “Him.”


When we follow these 3 requirements we not only avoid judgement for the wrong we have done, but God rewards us for our life of faithfulness to him that he gives us (2) special gifts in return:

To enjoy a life-time with Him who created us - - - (God)
To spend a lifetime in eternity with Him who saved us - - - (Jesus).

Don’t take the wrong path that will lead you into darkness, don’t be chained in darkness waiting for your own judgement, let God pull you out of darkness! In (Psalms 107:10) it says, “some sat in darkness and in gloom. Prisoners in misery and in IRONS.”
This does not have to be you! Let God remove the chains that bind you, the chains that are keeping you from coming to him, God will set you free!!

I had some romantic notions about going over there as a tough U.S. marine, kickin’ some commie ass, and coming back with war stories to swap with my dad.
Julie and I finally got up and walked over to a little neighborhood store and got a couple of bottles of pop, and I got some Hostess cupcakes. She didn’t want any junk food. She was always a smart and disciplined eater, and she had a beautiful complexion and a lithe, firm figure. I didn’t have any dietary concerns. I could eat anything that didn’t eat me first. I was an athlete for my high school, and had a pretty active lifestyle. I didn’t have a car yet. Drugs weren’t part of the local scene yet either. I smoked cigarettes. Julie didn’t smoke, and wanted me to quit. I tried to a couple of times. I loved her, and vowed to quit smoking, somehow, sooner or later. I smoked a lot less whenever we were together.
I eventually graduated, and started school at the community college. Kennedy was assassinated. Things got hot in Vietnam. I enlisted -- in the Air Force. Julie was happy I wasn’t going to Vietnam, at least not as a marine or a soldier. She and my family saw me off at the airport.
My family loved her, too, and her family loved me. I was thinking of marrying her after she graduated. I wrote to her and my family, and she always sent me perfumed letters. I got through boot camp, and was sent to technical training school in Amarillo, Texas. I got one letter there from Julie, and then no more. I hadn’t heard from my parents in a while, either. Then I finally got the news from my parents. Julie had been out with some friends, in her friend’s car. As they were crossing an intersection … a speeder ran a red light … three of the four girls were killed. My Julie was one of them.
I couldn’t finish the letter … my eyes … they … I seemed to have “caught a cold”. I had to go blow my nose.
My hands were shaking. I went to my room in the barracks. My roommates weren’t there. I composed myself and struggled through the letter, then I lay down on my bunk and wept, and cried myself to sleep. I didn’t want to live anymore. I couldn’t believe it, my baby was gone. I mourned for a long time. Well, I was nearly twenty. I wrote a short, but nice letter of condolence to Julie’s parents. I wept again, and let some tears fall on the letter and smear some ink. I was young and resilient, and gradually got over it … mostly.
After I finished my training, I transplanted to California. Years, decades, a marriage and a divorce later, in July, 1992, I took a week’s 4th of July vacation from work, and headed up to Spokane in my jeep to visit my parents. My seventeen year old son went with me. We spent a few days with my parents, and saw my cousins, and tripped around Spokane a little. My son and I stopped in Manito Park, and we got out and walked around. I told him a little about how a girlfriend and I used to frolic here an’ there. There we sat down on a bench and talked a little. Then it got quiet, and I went “AWOL” for a minute. I missed her. I still loved her. Then I heard “Dad… dad… yo, dad,” he touched my arm, and I heard Scott calling “Dad…”
I came back, looked at him, grinned and said “Excuse me. Trippin’ down memory lane here.”
We went back to the Jeep and got in, and I sat there staring blankly out the windshield. Pretty soon he was dingin’ me again. I told him about the park bench, and briefly, what happened. He stared silently out the windshield, then said “Damn, dad… (sigh) what a bomb, I’m sorry.” I cleared my throat, and said,
“Yeah. That was a long time ago. I had to do this. Closure, ya’ know?” He nodded. I said, “Well, how about we go get a bite to eat, huh?”
“Yeah, dad. Good idea.”"

Then, with only a clatter and a crash of sound, she was gone.
I surveyed the mess she’d made of my room. Walking over to the chest of drawers, I tried to lift it back into place. How’d she even move it in the first place? I could barely lift it, and I knew she wasn’t that strongly telekinetic. Then a drop of water fell into my eyes, and I dropped the chest onto my toe. And where’d she get the water, anyway?
Once I cleaned up my personal disaster area, I went down to the kitchen. My sister was eating cereal, her bowl rattling furiously as she hunted out the marshmallow bits. Dad was eating and reading a newspaper. As Mom asked me what I wanted for breakfast, a page turned and Dad’s fork put another bite of egg and toast in his mouth, both seemingly of their own volition.
“Waffles?” Before I sat down, a plate was in front of me with just the right number of waffles and the perfect amount of syrup and butter. It made me smile as I picked up my own fork.
Food was Mom’s special talent, but she could manifest almost anything. Dad was an ectoplasmist, able to imbue inanimate objects with a life of their own though he had to keep his attention on them. My sister was a poltergeist, so everything she does includes noise and some amount of telekinesis. And I was...just me. No special abilities, though I knew my parents hadn't given up hope that one would develop. I was way past the age when I should have had powers, and that put me in a distinct minority.
It was raining when I headed off to school where the principal was kind enough to have a class entirely for people with no powers. It meant that I had friends who didn’t rub that in. We played sports or built robots or ran science experiments while the rest of the school learned to use and control their abilities. Of course, my class got smaller every year as late-bloomers developed and were put in a control class.
I’m used to not having any kind of power. The worst part is the awkward silence when somebody I’ve just met asks, “and what do you do?” It’s like going to shake with someone only to realize they’re missing a hand.
I was almost at school when I saw the new girl. She had on a long raincoat and a black umbrella, so her face stood out. She was beautiful. We locked eyes for a moment before she turned, and we were pulled into the school by the rush of people responding to the first bell. I found myself beside her as she paused a moment to close the umbrella.
“Hi.”   She smiled a bit uncertainly. “Hi. Umm, I’m Andraste.”
“I’m Norman. Can I help you find your class?”
“Uh, yeah, thanks. I’m looking for...Ms. Shelbink’s?”
She was a mundane, and she was in my class. I had to play this cool, when I really wanted to shout and turn cartwheels. “You’re in the right company. That’s my class, too. It’s this way.”
We cautiously made friends with each other over the next few weeks. Then one day, I saw her in the hallway surrounded by a group of boys who were among the worst bullies in the school. Tears streaked her pretty face as they used their powers to pull the books from her hands and twisted her hair into knots.
Before I even thought about it, I gripped the football I was bringing in from the sports class and threw it as hard as I could. I’ve been playing football since middle school, and I’ve got a deadly arm. The ball blasted the back of Tony’s shoulder, jolting him enough that he lost focus on his powers. Andraste’s books crashed to the floor from where he’d been making them dance and tumble through the air. He turned to look at me, dumbfounded.
“Pick on somebody that’ll actually bloody your nose for you, douchebag.” I pulled another football out of the sports bag, and got ready.
The first football floated up to shoulder height and began to spin. “What did you think you were going to do? A noner against me?”
Noner. Slang for “non-powered.” At the slur, people began edging to each end of the hallway. Looking at the spin of the football, I began to regret giving him a weapon. He could rocket that thing with an ectoplasmic burst far faster than I could use my own to break his concentration. I was outgunned.
I threw anyway, hoping to dodge, but I didn’t move fast enough. His football hit me in the ribs and knocked all the wind out of me. A second later, mine hit Tony square in the nose, bloodying it immediately. As I lay half propped up on the lockers, I heard the click of cameras that the manifesters had been calling to hand. I couldn’t breathe and everything was muffled, almost silent except for that single noise. Tony scurried off to the bathroom with his flunkies following like a cloud of gnats on a stink.
The bell rang just as I wheezed in enough air to start breathing again. Andraste hurried to my side, hands over her mouth, and knelt. In seconds we were alone in the hallway. I raised my hand and wiped away the wet tracks left by the tears.
“Oh, you magnificent fool,” she whispered, then leaned in to kiss me. I lost my breath again.
The trouble started a few weeks later. I woke up for school, but the house was quiet. It felt ominous. With my sister’s powers, the house is never quiet.
I went downstairs and saw her sitting at the table, hugging her tiger and crying. I could hear Mom and Dad talking quietly in their room, and so I picked her up. As soon as I did, all the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as if a cold breeze had went down my shirt. I had the distinct feeling that I’d been tasted, as if by an animal nuzzling up to see if I was good to eat. It was eerie, but it went away and I returned to the task of comforting my sister.
After talking to Mom and Dad, I found out she’d lost her powers. At school, I discovered she wasn’t the only one.
Once I came back home, the house was no longer silent. My sister was gleefully making up for lost time, but it was my Dad’s powers that were on the fritz.
This went on, with different people being affected every day, but I noticed that more people lost their powers. At first it was about twenty. Now it was almost half the school.
We discussed it in Ms. Shelbink’s. A few were willing to let it go on, till they all lost their powers for good.
Andraste stood up when she heard that. “Stop it. You all know that isn’t right. To demand, or to allow, something to be taken away from others just because you don’t have it is wrong.”
One of the malcontents asked her, “Would you say the same about Tony and his crew?”
“Even them. Just because a few misuse their powers doesn’t mean they should all lose them. Think of all the good those with powers can do. There are healers who can fix things that were incurable in the past. Manifestors who produce our food. Ectoplasmists who keep our energy stations up and running. We all benefit. Those who misuse their powers should be taught better, not be stripped of those powers.”  The class discussion kind of stalled when someone asked, “But what can we do to help them recover the powers?” A few people reported being sniffed or tasted like I’d been, usually when next to somebody who’d lost their powers.
The next day I came to school in a funk because my sister was going through another powerless period. The amount of time between being affected and regained their powers was generally increasing. It seemed that the first time they lost their powers was the shortest.
Andraste stalked up to my locker, her place in a book marked by a finger. “I figured it out.”
I looked at the page she pointed out, then looked at the cover. “This is a book on mythology,” a quick flip to the copyright, “that’s over a hundred years old.”
“But look. It fits the symptoms exactly. Draugr are insatiably hungry spirits that target magicians, who lose all of their powers while being fed upon.”
“Ok, but how could we prove that this is what’s happening? I mean, people have only had powers for about sixty years. Maybe they’re just losing them as suddenly as people once gained them.”
“People gained powers when the dragons came back. As long as they’re all here, people will still have powers.”  “But this could be a disease, or…”
“I know how it can be proven. The history museum has some old stuff, like glasses people used to see spirits. We can get Ms. Shelbink to get them loaned to the school for an educational display, then see if we can spot anything.”
I shook my head. “You’ve been really thinking about this. If it is a Draugr, how do we stop it?”
“Them. It’s a lot of them. My theory is that they breed when they’ve fed off enough energy. And it says iron, leavened by ecto...How are we going to get that?” “I know. Iron is anathema to ectoplasm, but I think I’ve got this figured out.” I remembered a demonstration a few years ago, where a group of manifestors and ectoplasmists created a pool of raw ectoplasm, and let us all play with it.
It took almost a week to get two pairs of the special glasses from the museum. As a bonus, they also included a chemistry set specifically designed to experiment with ectoplasm. It was perfect for what I had in mind. Meanwhile, Andraste cajoled the whole class to pull iron nails out of old buildings. With the newly acquired glasses, and a team to bottle us some raw ectoplasm, we got our first look at a Draugr and had an arsenal ready for it.
It looked like a bloated corpse riding on the girl’s back, its lips fastened on her neck. We put my plan into action. I unstoppered a beaker of ectoplasm. Andraste and I watched its malevolent eyes fix on the beaker, then it let go of the girl and floated over. As soon as the Draugr began slurping it up, Andraste dropped a nail through the spirit and into the beaker. The ectoplasm began to boil and evaporate immediately. We watched as the creature from a bad horror movie boiled and dissipated along with it. The nail crumbled into a small pile of rust.
We shared the glasses with the rest of the class, so everyone knew what a Draugr looked like, but we also conducted naked-eye experiments so that we’d all know when a beaker had attracted one of the spirits and when to drop the nail. It took less than a week to clear the town of the infestation. People recovered their powers as soon as their bodies built up enough of an ectoplasmic charge. My sister’s poltergeisting stopped as her power matured into an ectoplasmist.
The school threw a party for our class. Manifestors catered and provided a fireworks display. Ectoplasmists entertained us with self-playing instruments, juggling, and even fireworks dance in the air. The highlight was when Tony came up to Andraste and me, shuffling his feet for a moment then visibly bucking up.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been picking on you. I can’t thank you enough for helping, even after I was such a douchebag.”
Later that night, Andraste and I were alone, sitting on her front porch.
“What do you think it would be like? To live somewhere that nobody has powers?”
She shook her head, then showed me that old mythology book. “But I think we can find out. It talks of a place called Waystation.” She read me the description. “It is said to be the midpoint between all of the worlds, the place where you can travel from one world to the next.” Turning her soft eyes back to mine, she said, “Graduation’s in a few weeks. Come with me, and we’ll find Waystation together. We’ll go to a world where no one has powers.”
I took that old book, and I threw it over my shoulder as I leaned in to kiss her. This time I took her breath away."

Red pushed the carriage up the front porch. Suzie’s bare feet slapped down the stairs.
“How did you ever get yourself into this baby carriage?”
“Red helped, in his own way,” blushed Lilly.
A blushing goose? Suzie snapped off a few more shots. “Well we need to get you out of there. You have gotten so big Lilly. I won’t hurt the eggs if I lift you, will I?”
“No sweetie, but do hurry, please. I am starting to feel a lot of pressure down there.”
“Okay, hold still.” Suzie let her camera hang from its strap again, reaching under the fat goose, trying to cradle her like an overgrown baby, she lifted Lily from the carriage.. “Oh my… what is all of this?”
“It was in the water,” honked Lilly, “Probably left by the young humans from last night. They were out reveling all night.”
There was a six-pack plastic ring shackling both her web feet together then shrink wrap tight around and up her legs. Suzie laid Lily on the grass.
“I’m going to take some pictures first so I can show my Girl Scout leader. Okay?”
“Just be quick sweetie, I need to get back to my nest soon.”
Suzie snapped a dozen photos from various angles to show the devastation all that garbage out at Lilly Lake was causing. This time she removed the camera from her enck and placed it on the front steps, then got busy unwrapping Lilly from all the debris. Suzie got so mad while she was working that she yanked a little too hard once and Lilly honked.
When she was finished, Suzie hugged the silly Lilly white goose who thought she was a swan, then set Lilly Swan and Red Fox on their way, snapping picture after picture of their departure. After their wasn nothing left to take pictures of Suzie collected the debris and brought it in the house. She would need it for evidence, she thought and placed it all in a plastic bag. There was a Spring Cleanup project coming up with her Girl Scout troop, Suzie was determined to have them clean up Lilly Lake."

Flexing the effeminate ,springing from the sun nurtured soil,
Where all of her sculptured, vernal boles will spout.
Crest of Elysium hydraulics cyclical cycles rains hauled down;
Wells up to form, that old masculine's ever pouring spout.
Cornucopian grains camaraderie with pea-pod-cob; in unison
For water wrought kernel-n-corn every due, do dew drop.
Cloaked nocturnal secreted without our diurnal accouterments,
Star, nor moon ceaseless celestial spheres dare ever stop.
Blink of Shangri-La let's not us speculate of a future within,
Neither should we gaze without at inauthentic past.
Engage the elements embrace the ecumenical creation this day,
While we are right here and now or glimpse it last.
Envision the sliver of the utopia a splendid aggregate,
Reptilian herd rambling over rock, pebble, and stone.
For floral or for fauna the Edenic Keep amasses with the whole,
Whether hop, slither, or wiggle leave none alone.
Cold reflected is the mirror image just as reality in reverse,
Circular are the ardent capillary roots.
Bold refracted magnified glimmer from upon the upper shore to underneath,
Warmed the concentrated germ do render up the shoot.
Ancient arboreal trunk, limb, and nest the same hatchlings haven,
Daylight fed, only the insatiable starved.
Dendron are branch-n-bough immaculately twisted though they seem to appear,
All are at the whittlers hand every twig thus carved.
Congeries, coterie, collective be buds, the blossom, the bloom, and the spore,
Plethora are frond and panoramic are seed, reed, weed.
Amongst needle or leaf alike the beast; the acorn, the cone, and the nut,
Hoard does that vair to be, the Rex rodent of the tree.
Pelagic seaward wake unto wake ""Rosy finger Dawn"" will not thee forsake,
Clouds sail wither wherever, the wild wind blows.
Xanadu's chiseled retinues; rather retainers, firmed wall, or gouged step,
Abject the boundaries, not to be known; nor, to know.
Isolated within the immense, pity not the separate and distinct, it has always been right in front of us…
See it! Amen!"

The little gun did more damage than I thought possible. I told myself it was an accident, but I know better. I had pictured shooting him many times since I bought the gun.
I left him and went straight to the airport. I thought I was free, free from the prison of my marriage, from being beaten, from the hell that had become my life. I should have known evil wouldn’t die so easily.
But he found me. The funny thing is, he gave me the ultimate freedom. Now I have no fears and nothing to worry about. Death. Pleace. I am finally free.

She pulled on some mismatch sweats over her pajamas, put her hair back into something resembling a ponytail, and slipped into some highlighter yellow crocs. She was the walking dead, all the way to her petrified fossil of a minivan.
Of course, a trip to the craft store became a trip to the mall. Then, a trip to the grocery store (with a brief trip to the wine section for Rebecca!). Then a trip to the gas station, and the adjoining car wash. It was a four hour trip in total. Rebecca was guided back home by a fading sun. By the time she had finished washing the after dinner dishes, the moon was out patrolling the night skyline.
Rebecca ascended to her refuge of rest on autopilot. She poured herself into her bed’s soft embrace, sweats, and all, began to doze off. There was a soft knock at the door. Rebecca gave a grunted invitation into her cozy lair. Her twins peered in cautiously. They were filled with a guilty sadness, at the sight of their depleted and defeated matriarch.
The twins entered their mother’s room, with an aura of peaceful compassion. Tyler removed Rebecca’s crocs first. Then Skylar released her hair from its elastic bondage. Rebecca retreated her weary head to the fluffy solace of her pillow. The twins raised her comforter up, and wafted back down over her.
There was a gentle kidd from Tyler to Rebecca’s cheek, and one from Skylar to her forehead. The twins tiptoed their way out of her nocturnal nest, and lightly closed the door behind them, A loving smile emerged through Rebecca’s exhausted features. She had one last thought, before she dissolved into a distant dream. “Thank you God, for my family.”"

I came seeking an experience of a lifetime and nothing was going to stop me from doing so.
I spent my days exploring the open range vigorously and watching birds. I swam for hours at a time in the same lakes that I pretend to know how to flyfish in. I slept under the stars and reunited with my inner-self through sessions of meditation in the midst of the warmth provided by campfires. I was living as though I was born for the lifestyle. This adventure had definitely presented a new normal unlike any I have ever known, or even imagined at that.
After a few weeks passed by, the autumn days became cherished memories of the past and the new climate of winter quickly replaced them. Dark gray clouds covered the skies and were the only indication of peril that I recognized. The last few days have proven just how fast sugar can sour. Conditions become harsh. Not just for me but for nature as a whole.
It all started when an unexpected blizzard came rushing out of the north, migrated in, and covered the red clay with several feet of snow. It was by far the most I had ever seen outside of the Home Alone movies.
As I began to navigate the unknown amount of miles back toward where I left the jeep I rented, I noticed what appeared to be a small group of dogs off in the distance. The reason why I noticed them so easily was because their movement was a first besides the wind and myself in the vicinity for three days. I kept making my way.
As I began to navigate the unknown amount of miles back toward where I left the jeep I rented, I noticed what appeared to be a small group of dogs off in the distance. The reason why I noticed them so easily was because their movement was a first besides the wind and myself in the vicinity for three days. I kept making my way.
The snow seemed to be packed tight enough to sustain the vast majority of my weight. Until all of a sudden It didn’t. Catching me off guard, a fatigue stricken step sank deep into the snow. The freezing temperatures numbed the pain of the impact. After I pulled my foot out of the hole and planted it into that first step, the pressure proved to be too much. I collapsed right there. My ankle was shattered into pieces.
Once again, a rare movement caught my eye and I looked up. That group of dogs had closed in and had me surrounded, except they weren’t dogs at all but wolves. Wolves that were snarling viciously, foam dripping from their mouths. Despite how cold it was outside, as I concentrated on the dark wolf in front me, perspiration seeped from my brow. One wolf lunged from my left and sank his teeth deep into my neck. Complete darkness took over. An unexpected next season. A new normal with a peace like never before.
“ Full Moon Shining” by E.J. Jernigan
It wasn’t an easy defeat to accept. Though none of us would admit such, the hunt was over before it even started. No amount of eagerness or determination would have balanced the beam for me nor my kindred.
We navigated through several miles of knee-deep snow before fatigue set in. Even then, we didn’t abandon the pursuit purposefully, but with each of us needing to catch our breath, the pace dwindled drastically. By the time we ran out of the forest we were topping a rise that gave view to an endlessly open snow frosted field. The only evidence that we were on the right track were the human shaped footprints that stretched beyond sight.
The cause was lost. The cold blooded monster had bested the pack. For the time being anyway. The thrill of killing in such a perilous territory would lure the bloodsucker back, and with each passing day we were maturing more and more. We will be ready.
As a wave of realization washed over me, I lifted my snout skyward, toward the full moon’s shining, and let out a sharp howl Into the distance. The rest of the pack chimed in with me. A warning that said return at your own risk. With a deep sigh, I lowered my head and crunched my way back to the village.
Most people have the opportunity to live life on their own terms. To be this or to be that. If you would like. Not everyone though. Some aren’t as fortunate. Some are born for a singular sole purpose. At first this was a harsh shot to swallow. I was selfish and didn’t care anything about humanity as a whole. Constantly I asked myself, why me? I mean, who wants to be a slave to destiny?
That’s not a confession of being completely heartless, though. I had just given it wholeheartedly to my life mate, Lydia. The only time I wasn’t selfish was when it came to her. To say that I loved her doesn’t convey the half. So naturally when the murder rate hit an all time high and claimed her life with it, something in me snapped. The pain that I felt from the loss was indescribable. It was a pain that nobody should ever have to endure. A pain that spread throughout society at a far quicker rate with me denying my role in the grand scheme.
I realized that somebody had to bear the burden so I accepted myself for who I was born to be. At all cost, it’s my responsibility to protect the living from the murderous walking dead. I started running with the pack and doing my part to exterminate the creatures of the night, yet my mind was still distracted. The numbness that I had slipped into was by far better than the initial shock and pain but served as a barrier that divided me from anything that felt normal or joyous.
A month passed by and the climate grew brutally cold. Snowflakes were falling from the sky in rapid succession. Though I possessed the ability to shift into my wolf body, the conditions still made for exhaustively challenging hunting. A debate warred inside my mind as to whether or not I wanted to brave such elements. Just as I was leaning toward staying in, I overheard an elder warning another hunter to keep an extra close eye on me. Tonight’s targeted cover was responsible for Lydia’s death. No way could I sit this one out.
Once we located the scent and were hot on the trail, I felt a buzz and had forgotten I even existed. Through an opening In the canopy, a shining of the moon highlighted a slight movement of shadow against the white snow. Softly planting my paws, I crept in that direction. I was dead set on avenging the only person I had ever loved. As I made my way around a thick oak I caught sight of a vampire feeding mindlessly. With a rage that would fill Bruce Banner with envy, I lunged at the monster, sank my teeth deep into his neck, and ripped it off his shoulders. The immortal being had killed for the last time.
Releasing my jaws, the head fell to the ground and rolled half a turn. I looked up into the sky, past the falling snow at the moon, and released a long howl in victory.
Right there underneath the night sky, deep within, in a place that I had closed off, I felt a portion of myself that hadn’t been present since I lost Lydia."

In some cases, that may be so, yet consider what you might have in common with my experiences and consider the possibility of you rising above your own past, into a higher state of being, with those pursuing the same, which is what a healthy society consists of.
On the Adverse Childhood Experiences (A.C.E.) survey, I score a perfect 10. That means I’m highly likely to die from cancer, a heart attack, or a violent crime, and the fact that I’m in prison for murder is typical- also, I should be crazier than I am. (P.T.S.D. is a problem- people scare me and I hurt them, bad. Sometimes I feel anointed to punish bullies…).
Now, the horror movie that was my childhood took place in rural areas and small towns. Yours might have taken place in the ghetto or even another planet (joking!), but I ask you to consider the possibility that we had similar hardships and have similar hardships. If my adamant will to understand myself and the world can lead to me gaining some of that understanding, maybe such a will can work for you; maybe you, like a phoenix, can rise out of the ashes of your past and escape the grip of those who, intentionally or from their own ignorance, damaged you.
It takes some balls/ovaries to see yourself for what you truly are, and only then can you see what needs improving.
Best of luck!

One night I couldn’t take it anymore. I flew towards the light post again, as I’d done before, but didn’t ring any alarms. I scanned the sky for a few seconds, then busted a ‘Super Man’ throughout the city. Flying felt better than any rollercoaster, or drug, I’d ever been on.
“I told you not to do it!” I heard a female voice screaming inside my head. “Now how are you going to come down?” She was right, I tried to stop but I just kept soaring higher and higher. I started to worry and thought I was going to die. I pictured my mom waking up that morning to find me unresponsive on my bed with my tongue hanging out. “If you have faith you could come down!”
I conjured all the faith inside me, then I had to walk a long way home.
From then on, upon realizing that I was outside my body, I’d try to go back in immediately and wake myself up. But one night I was feeling rebellious. Trying my hardest to fly, I couldn’t make it outside the door. An invisible force was blocking me. On my last attempt, I made progress but something caught me in midair, spun me around and threw me back inside the room. An angry voice yelled at me while attempting to go back inside my body, “You selfish idiot, son of a bitch!” It kept screaming obscenities at me, for a minute, even after I was fully awake. Very scary, very disrespectful.
When I told people about this, they thought I was crazy, but what my dad told me to put everything into perspective. It turned out that when he was young, he was studying how to travel outside of his body. Just like me, one night he went too far and it scared him straight.
My nights started getting worse. I’d try to fly and the spirits would drag into a dark abyss or I’d succeed and manage to land in another world where tortured souls encountered their demons. These were more than nightmares. I was literally going to Hell and back.
Whatever my dad conjured up in the past was haunting me. I guess “the sins of the father” crap is true. So, I prayed even though I’m NOT religious. “Lord, whatever this is, it’s getting out of hand. I didn’t seek it, and if it’s a gift I don’t want it. Please take it away.”
A few nights later, my spirit was soaring through the universe; only this time, I was guided by something divine. I felt safe and was allowed to go anywhere I wanted. “Don’t be afraid,” a voice in my head said.
I dove into the ocean and saw the water molecules break down in slow motion. I went inside a power cable and became one with the energy. Then, I flew past the moon and beyond. When I had enough, I came back without incident.
Till this day, I have NOT had another out of body experience again."

Can you believe I used to dread the 3 o’clock bell signalling the end of the school day?b Because I never knew what waited for me when I got home.
Fast forward a few years and my mom decided she needed to leave. She couldn’t take the abuse and his constant belittling and humiliation became too much for her. I realize not that it was a hard decision to make, but she still had two sons she was leaving behind with a violent ex-drunk, it would only get worse. He went to AA and was sober for years, but became more angry and violent.
As I got older and into my teens, I started working out. I played high school football and lifted weights so now the beatings stopped and the verbal abuse started. Funny thing though: an ass whoopin lasts a few minutes, those words scar for life. Now Keith took the brunt of the abuse and I protected him as best I could. One night, I was in my room doing homework and I could hear my father berating Keith and him apologizing, but he wouldn’t stop. Finally I couldn’t take it anymore and I came out of the room and threw him in the corner and jacked him up. “Let’s go, me and you, right now!” I told him, “Everyday I’m getting bigger and stronger and you’re getting older and weaker.” He didn’t do anything. He didn’t want to fight me, but then, later on he came into the living room with his gun and said, “You have one weakness, you can’t sleep with one eye open. I won’t use my hands on you anymore and I Won't use that bat, I’ll put five in your fucking head while you’re sleeping.” Now you tell me what kind of father tells his son that?
I can remember being little, 8 or 9 years old and asking God, “Please let my father get shot tonight at work.” I can recall standing over him with a knife early in the morning while he was passed out on the couch, trying to talk myself into stabbing him. To this day I tell my mom I regret not killing him back then.
My mom managed to get her marriage annulled by the catholic church and then went into the convent and became a nun with the sisters of Carmelites. She was Sister Dorothy Teresa. Keith died of an accidental overdose, oxycontin. We buried him on 911 and on the way to the church, the planes hit the towers. One year later on SEptember 18th, the feds kicked in my door and arrested me. A few years later, in october ‘05, my father died of a heart attack. He was all alone in his house, just him and his dog. If it weren’t for his neighbor noticing that he hadn’t taken in the trash can for a few days and notifying the sheriff, he’d still be there.
I hadn’t spoken to Sister Dorothy Teresa for quite a few years until I saw her at Keith’s funeral and then not a single word for 7 years after stemming from an argument of some of the arrangements her and her sister made concerning the wake and burial. Keith was not only my brother, he was my best friend. Not only that, he and my dad were actually very close now. So when she refused to compromise with me about two minor details that mean a lot to me, I chased her and her family from the cemetery.
On December 15, 2005, I was extradited from my federal prison in Louisiana back to Miami, Florida where I was indicted for 1st degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. I was also informed that the state was seeking death. When the state charges you with the death penalty, they assign you a special lawyer who is death qualified and his sole job is to keep you alive if you love trial. He handles the penalty phase. He hires investigators to dig up your past from the day you were born looking for mitigating factors to help keep you alive.
These investigators found my mom. She had left the convent and was taking care of my grandmother who was getting old and suffering from dementia. She had no idea what was going on with me. Then one day in 2007, I received a birthday card. It said, “Dear Paul, the day I buried your brother I felt like I lost both my sons. You are all I have left. You father is dead. Your brother is dead. I’m all you have left.” It went on and on about how I didn’t let her grieve at her own son’s funeral and the pains of burying a son.
I wrote my mom a letter apologizing for my actions explaining that I handled things poorly, but I tried to compromise with her and she wouldn’t budge. And don’t you know, my mom flew down for the trial and sat right behind me everyday. Even after hearing some bad things during some of the testimony, the only thing she said to me was, “Your friends aren’t very nice.”
We won! At least in my eyes we won. We hung the jury, 6 to 6, deadlock! The state had no case, just a bunch of liars given deals to shorten their time so they decided not to retry me. I took 20 years to run concurrently with my fed time and get out in about a year. I was given a special visit with my mom during the trial and I asked her, “Why didn’t you ever do anything?” At first she said, “You and your brother were so beautiful, blonde hair almost white, and blue eyes, that whew, I looked at you, I couldn’t believe anyone would hurt you.” I didn’t buy that. No way! She saw the bruises. She saw the blood. So I pressed harder.
A mother’s number one job is to protect her children. Most moms would die for their kids and then she told me,”I was afraid. I was terrified of him. He told me more than once he would kill me.”
I was okay with that answer and today we have a nice relationship. She visits me regularly and is my biggest supporter. She’s 72 years old and raising Keith's daughter. It makes me so happy to see the relationship they have and the bond they share.
We don’t get to choose our parents and some people are dealt a better hand than others. I know I’ve been through a lot and I’ve learned a lot. I thank God my mother is still alive and that I will get a chance to spend some time with ehr and give back to her a litte."

It’s just the way we’ve let it be because we let it be so. (Groups like France’s yellow vests have gotten off their asses to make it be some other way, as their ancestors did on the first Bastille Day). Of course there are religious, gender, and many other chains and binders we’re taught to handicap ourselves with, which have become so normal that we fail to realize that they are chains and binders.
Franz Kafka’s bizarre story “Metamorphosis” is most commonly interpreted as sending the message the creator of this picture intends to send: we trap ourselves In unnatural, handicapped roles in modern society. (Y’all should read Kafka’s other story, “In the Penal Colony”!)
Ironically, one chain that I held-that it’s unmasculine for a man to master poetry or literature-held me back from learning about Kafka until I was in my 30s! What makes that chain doubly ironic is that, as I learned from studying the origins of English poetry and great writers like Cervantes, Edmond Rostand and Alexander Dumas. Those who built the foundations for our great Western literature were not effeminate, not weak. In fact, as exemplified In the classic, “Cyrano De Bergerac”, many warriors were also poets, from the notorious Celts all into Medieval Europe and, exemplified by Ernest Hemingway, modern America.
Yet somehow-particularly In rural white America, even in the largely Celtic Blue Ridge/Appalachian areas, despite the ancient Celts prizing of their poets-the false idea that being a wordsmith Is a sign of weakness has taken root. Now, with texting and tweeting further crucifying our language, with technology so blinding/distracting us, I doubt many will care to sharpen their verbal swords … which Is fine by me, ‘cause I’m gonna impress all the girls while the tongue tied many hold their chains."

“That’s why I mess with Fred. You know what it is.” Lucy said. “The quicker we get there, the bigger the tip. Now mush my little ghetto husky, mush!”   “Geez, you’re a pain in the ass!” Freddy said while picking up the speed.
“That does it, wise-guy, pull over!” Lucy said. “I’m calling an UBER. Un-like you, those things are all ride and no lip.”
Freddy just laughed it off and kept going. “Lighten up Lue, you don’t wanna do that. Those UBER things have been all over the news lately. With your luck you’ll end up with a psychopath on four wheels.”
“You’re probably right.” Lucy said. “I’m better off with a scrawny ass on 4 legs.”
“Trust me, my scrawny ass will get you to your destination in 30 minutes or less, or your next ride is free.”
“30 minutes my tail feathers! QUACK!” Lucy said. “We’re only going across the street!”
“Maybe if you flap your wings it’ll push us along a little faster” Freddy said.
“FYI, my wings are useless right now, you little flea factory. They’re only good for smacking smart-alecks in the kisser.” Lucy said. “Say something else and find out.”
Freddy safely made it to the big building across the street and banged on the door while Lucy yelled profanities at him. “Open the door! Lucy is already starting to quack and cursing up a storm!!”
Dr. Goldberg open the door and a team of nurses rushed outside with a gurney. Lucy was so heavy that when they lifted her up, they almost dropped her.
“Hello Lucy, how are you feeling today?” Dr. Goldberg asked while examining her eyeballs with a tiny flashlight.
“I feel like my guts are about to explode. QUACK!” Lucy said while her eyes rolled to the back of her head. “I don’t think I could hold it in any longer.”
“Alright, I need all hands on deck!” Dr. Goldberg said to his staff. “Get the machines ready for an emergency extraction!”
“I think she needs something for this pain, Doc.” Freddy said. “This is the worst I’ve ever seen her.”
“No problem.” Dr. Goldberg whipped out a syringe and injected Lucy with a mind numbing tranquilizer. “This will take her away from Painsville and make her feel like she’s at Disney World.”
At the emergency room, Dr. Goldberg clamped two wires onto Lucy: one in the middle of her chest, the other on her forehead. The wires were connected to a car battery and a handheld switch. Dr. Goldberg handed the switch to Freddy and asked, “Would you like to do the honors?”
“Hell yeah!” Freddy wagged his tail, flipped the switch and howled up to the moon while shock waves surged through Lucy’s body! Lucy flapped her wings profusely, levitating three feet above the gurney while her entire body shook. “There she blows!” Quickly, Dr. Goldberg placed a nest below her as a nurse turned up the voltage.
“QUUUUAAACK!” A huge golden egg the size of a bowling ball came shooting out of Lucy; landing right into the nest. Lucy collapsed on the floor and twitched with the wires still attached to her.
“Wow, this is the biggest egg I’ve ever seen.” Dr. Goldberg said while his staff nursed Lucy’s wounds. “It’s a 200 pounder, at least.”
“Congratulations, Lue, you’re rich.” Freddy said with a smile. “Now maybe you could be my sugar momma.”
“That’s it! Next time I’m definitely calling an UBER.” Lucy said.

When the morning came, feeling the fluffy warmth surprised me. It’s been that way, sharing the king size bed, the past four years now. I like to think he assumes he can always curl up next to me by this leisure at bedtime. All four of them in the tent was a community experience. This year’s Iditarod is my new team’s first: Viola and Gamba, who I’ve mentioned already, accompanied by Loran and Yagi. They seemed to work well together so far. We had a good run going yesterday. Then, Mother Nature reared her ugly head with white out conditions.
I didn’t spot the clouds until Yagi kept glancing to the Southwest. I looked and saw the rolling clouds hurtling fast; snow covered survivors were the only way we were going to make it through. I pulled up at a clearing among some trees on the trail to set up our camp. I had planned on going twice as far, but I can only hope the other competitors have the same delays. While I set up the tent and secured the sled, Yagi’s nervousness had the other three fidgety like the agitated two-year olds all lathered up over a change in what we trained for. The shelter went up frantically to ease the tension and we all slept snuggly warm like a pack congregated in a cave den.
When I unzipped the flap, I was greeted with the blinding, snow-white powder that covered everything, light rebounding off the flakes in every shade possible of yellow and white. If the Aurora Bealis had its yin to its yang, this would be it. I looked at the trail and said…”What trail?”
Six-feet deep in every direction obliterated the race trail. Loran was going to have her work cut out today. Due west today until we hit something familiar.
I’m going to run them in a side-by-side formation to start today. We need to haul ourselves out of this mess, and perhaps those behind us need a trail to follow, also. If we meet on a road, I’ll switch them to the traditional nose-to-tail.
Going to stow this journal with all the gear and head out. God bless us today.

Yet, punishment punished every day
Two men living in a bathroom

Old hoofprints and tufts of hair
Dust and musty air
Ghosts of cowboys stand and stare
A Heart Beats Time
With Tires Whine
Stygian Gloom
Under New Moon
The Freedom of Forward
Past but Pursues
Through Memories of Strife
To See Tomorrow, Revealed in the night
Like Straightened Curves Lit by a Morning Star
Endless Flight
Through Storms of Night
Bolts of Heaven Fade from Sight
Argent Ribbon ‘neath Luna’s Light
The Curse of Morpheus, a Futile Flight
Wonders and Beauty of Stars so Bright.

Your eggs may be turkey, duck, or chicken; and if you did not like turkey or duck eggs she might fool you into eating them. The bacon and sausage were from our own hog. The venison was canned in a pressure cooker on our gas stove, sometimes out of season depending on demand. You could also make special requests for pancake shapes, from an apple shape to a zebra. The cooked egg on the french toast was as thick as the bread, and the maple syrup came from the farmer down the road. I would slather them with butter from Daisy. Oatmeal was served hot and thick. Ma would buy the biggest cylinders on the shelf. I can still see the Quaker man watching over our breakfast. When the Quaker, or cream of wheat, came out, so did the bag of brown sugar, syrup, and butter. When we gorged on cornflakes, or puffed rice, from bags as big as your leg, the pure-cane sugar bowl would need to be refilled afterwards. With every breakfast, we had toast that was heated and browned over the flame of our gas stove using an antique toaster made for the job. To dress up the toast properly we lavishly spread on homemade jam and jelly, and sometimes, cinnamon.
I would wash down every breakfast with daisy's fresh milk. Many mornings the milk was still warm from her udder. Sometimes I drank a gallon every day. My dad said, ""That is why I bought a cow!"" We often enjoyed orange or grape juice too. Ultimately, I never remember going without breakfast, and I am grateful I was taught to eat breakfast. It is a blessing to me.
In prison, breakfast remains my favorite meal. I eat my portions, and then I look for more. ""Hey, Buddy; are you going to eat that?"" my favorite breakfast meals are now the ones served with oatmeal. I trade my pancakes or coffeecakes for more oatmeal. Although I cannot flood it with Daisy's milk and pile it high with a mountain of butter and brown sugar, I still experience a warm, satisfying feeling that reminds me of home.

He puffed on it like a cigarette and huffed out two huge billowing rings of smoke. The enlarging hazy rings enveloped around the little girl and encased her in a bubble, muffling the flute sound. The translucent, milky bubble lifted her into the sky and floated away.
“We must proceed forthwith,” the Priest announced, walking quickly through the trees. “The sun shall fall shortly.”
As the Warlock checked his satchel to ensure the safety of the RedGold, the towering trees next him began to move their branches like arms. The branches stretched out to grab at the Warlock’s legs and limbs. Startled, he dropped the RedGold Box and it landed like a thousand pounds of lead on a mossy path of dirt. The ground around the Warlock immediately shook and splintered open, swallowing the Warlock and the towering trees subduing him.
With his magic rope, the Wizard lassoed the RedGold Box as it titled on the edge of the rumbling open ground. He tugged on the rope and pulled the box into his hand. Before he could secure it in his shoulder bag he looked up to see the little girl with the goat legs falling quickly from the sky. She landed squarely, upright on her hooves, with a heavy thud that kicked up a plume of dust. As the little girl began calmly playing her flute-music again, what looked like a snarling two-headed muscular horse began galloping, with the force of a hundred horses, directly towards the Wizard. Without hesitation, the WIzard turned the opposite direction and ran for his life. In mid stride, the Wizard’s body separated into a swarm of buzzing black and red dragonflies that ascended high into the light blue sky.
The little girl picked up the Wizard’s bag from the ground and fished out the RedGold Box.
“So pretty,” she said, inspecting it and turning it over in her hand.
“No, no – please! Don’t!” the Priest yelled, a few feet away. As she opened the box, a bright blinding light emanated from inside. It was a light so powerful that it seemed to illuminate the entire world around her.
It was what appeared to be hours later, well after the Priest closed the RedGold Box, secured it safely in his hands and made his way to the Royal Chapel before sunset, when the little girl realized that she was now trapped inside the box with a billion other souls."

Below the title was a picture of Lilly in the wicker baby carriage with Red Fox pushing it. Between that and another picture, “Your garbage Could Have Killed Her,” then a picture of Lilly laying in Suzie’s front law, her webbed feet shackled by a six-pack top and clear plastic tangled around her legs, Below that, “HELP Cleanup Lilly Lake Saturday…” and all the contact information below that.
Suzie controlled her anger. “Yes.” Why would they question this? Wasn’t the photo proof enough? “It took me near a half hour to untangle her, and she was pregnant too. She almost started laying eggs while I was untangling her. That would have been bad.”
Cheerleaders are usually all smiles and giggles, there was none of that in this group. “I am so sorry,” whined blondie, “We didn’t know. They got us back pretty good though. It took me days of scrubbing before I felt clean again.”
Suzie had thought Red Fox and Lilly Swan were pulling her leg when they told her about their stinky raid on the “young evelers” as they called the.
“JIMMY!” yelled blondie, “Get over here. All of you get over here.”
The entire football team left their coaches stranded on the field, their coaches were none too happy, the worst they spewed were very naughty. Suzie was cast a shadow by towering hulks and short skirt beauties.
“This is Suzie Fowler,” presented blondie then stared down on Suzie, “They’re your friends right, the fox and the swan?”
Suzie gulped, bees started buzzing in her tummy , they were going to tease her, she just knew it. But Lily and Red were her friends and people are supposed to stand up for their friends. Suzie gulped down her fear, “They Are my friends.” Suzie held her breath.
No one laughed. No one giggled. There was not a smile or smirk in the bunch. The silence hung thick, thick enough to cut a steel knife. They were all just staring at her.
“Do you have any more posters?” asked blondie.
“I ran out of big ones,” quivered Suzie, “But I have a lot of the smaller ones.”
“David… You’re a part of the school newspaper right?” Blondie again.
“Yep, Chief Editor.” David was tall and wiry. He puffed his chest but there wasn’t much there.
“Okay, you make more copies. Everyone is going to show up for this cleanup… EVERYONE. And get some of the other teams to help out too.” Blondie started barking out orders. Everyone listened without interruption. When she finished she looked upon Suzie again.
“Please tell Lilly we are all very sorry. We will make sure it never happens again. Can we do anything for her?” Blondie was crying, not bawling or sobbing, but tears trickled down her pretty face.
“Well, she does complain a lot about the noise at night.”
Blondie smiled, “She does not need to worry about that ever again,” there was a general murmur of agreement, “I think we all learned our lesson on that account.”
Suzie giggled. So it was true, they had actually stunk up their partying. The coaches broke up their gathering, but not before getting an earful from blondie demanding that the faculty get involved with the cleanup as well.
After the cleanup, new posters went up around town. The whole town and nearly half the county showed up for the cleanup. Lilly, the Mallars, the Cnaadians and the Wood Ducks corralled their c hiks in the center of the lake while the humans cleaned everything up spick-and span. “Leave No Trace” plaques were posted at every entrance. Even the grumpy old mayor, who had been promising to cleanup Lilly Lake for years, showed up. His welcome was not warm.
The new posters had a picture of Suzie sitting by the clean shortline with Lily Swan and her chicks on her right, and Red Fox on her left, Suzie’s arms were wrapped around her two friends. The title atop the poster… “Suzie Fowler for Mayor.” It was so silly it made Suzie giggle every time she passed one."

To win the war
Bridges have been rebuilt and that's a huge

The biggest feat of all;
She’s better.

Dead for too long to admit,
But I came up for air, took a deep, satisfying
Breath and
It was a definite close call but,
In the end …
I survived."

My answer is simple in connection with what I’ve shared with you above. Life is the realm where the physical you exists on the level of mental awareness. Hell is a description of conditions presented in the physical, psychic, or emotional steps, stages, and degrees of the areas that are still learning and developing in one’s life. By listening to the parts of the Self that are eternal, therefore have always been, which is called the four mothers who speak in the language of Supreme Mathematics, the Hell you are aware of is communicated as an equation which is then scientifically broken down by the mind and solved through the actions of the person working the Divine equation, the sum of every equation worked through as instructed by the four mothers is Heaven on Earth, or Paradise with ones Earth/God.
Understanding that Hell is described as a pit because when someone is in Hell, it’s because they’ve allowed their base/animal nature to lord over the logical/mental Higher self which is always in the realms of Heaven which is the Paradise we are able to create through the execution of Supreme Mathematics which is to learn how to communicate on the cellular level with the four mothers who regulate our life force and the life force of this Planet, Earth.

We all could feel their vibrations through the surrounding steel. Being set to idle, they began to produce their own power filtering out an outside artificial power supply.
Reality slaps you in the face when the steel door is slammed shut, sealed, and locked behind you with a heavy thud, becoming water tight. With every moment spent, a fading slam, crunch, and thud thunder in the distance.
With a gloomy start, it became a routine workday. Over the intercom system raged a whistle then an echo … Reveille, Reveille… All hands on deck, waking all of its occupants.
Our mindset had changed the channels from a lifestyle of common life to the station where a man is constantly under pressure and strain, lacking sleep. Restationing a mindset is a must under these type of circumstances to survive the environment and its demands.
Breakfast would be served soon, but even then… I’m sure none of us were looking forward to hot provisions, let alone getting out of the rack.
The first day being gone was always the worst. Depression along with its mood swings became the biggest hardship to overcome and caused most of the conflicts among the crew. Though it didn’t take long before you were conditioned to the program which demanded you to pay attention to detail.
Work transformed into an asset for the mind to free itself from its own characteristics. When you are at hand, on deck, you could enjoy the beauty of the sunrise of sunset, blending stunning colors as the van’s features its light that shows a new day’s triumph or to fade away into the darkness. Either way, the sunlight would be filtered upon us, lighting our way into oblivion. Whether it be day or night, you could see every gleam, every cluster, every star. You could land all there was to see for there was no artificial blindness.
As you look upon the different challenges we all experience throughout our lifetimes, you could really see how powerful our Creator really is. What a mighty designer He can be. Then all beauty comes to an end…
Ten days later, a loud whistle came across the intercom following a shouting roar…
General Quarters… General Quarters… All hands, manned your battle stations. Within seconds, every man was up, dressed and running to their battle station as if we were at war…
I was stationed on the U.S.S. NASSAU LHA-4 from 1986 to late 1990. It was 1989 when our orders were to head to the coast of Iran and assist the rescue of the 109 American hostages as well as to serve and protect the freedom of the people foreign and domestic. We were part of the 6th fleet. Being an amphibious aircraft carrier holding 3800 Navy and Marine personnel, we manned our battle stations approaching off the coast of Iraq awaiting our orders.
My General Quarters station was manning of the 6” guns. Shells and powder by the pallets were railed to the weapon stations while helicopters and our A9slF22 harriers held their weight in flight. We were all waiting for something to happen.
Anxious to jump and fight our battle, waving strong our stars and stripes, we shipped off a battalion of marines to recon a populated area in Iran where the hostages were said to be held by Iraqi terrorists.
So we wait on guard, ready to attack, backing our troops by air, sea and ground.
The American hostages were rescued without a flaw during this highly televised campaign. Our troops went in, reconed and overcame hostile resistance without firing a shot. Only minor injuries were sustained with no major casualties, military or civilian. One happy ending to a long voyage.
It was a quick return as we entered our home port after engaging in three more months of ongoing adventure the United States Navy promised its enlisted. Our holidays were over, lost out to sea, but we made due. Duty to our country always came first as a soldier.
Finally we pulled into our port and tied up to the dock, I found, when I stepped off of the ship and into my home in Virginia Beach, Virginia, the best surprise one could ever imagine. My children chose to wait for their daddy to celebrate the day Jesus was born.
Together.
What a proud moment for God, the United States Navy and myself as a father. What a beautiful gift from God. The best Christmas gift one could ever receive."

She got depressed, took what remained of my life savings, and returned to her mother and her old boyfriends.
My second wedding was in an austere church in North Carolina. A reception followed with no music. Scores of holier-than-thou friends of the bride and a scattering of my friends and family chatted awhile, and then left Pamela and I to do the dishes.
My second marriage, regrettably, lasted seven times as long as the first. Pamela took everything I had, and had me put in prison.
I will always love Cathy. In the unlikely event that I ever get married again, it will be in a nice church with stained glass windows. I will never be able to arrange the pomp and circumstance like Prince Harry, but the bride will promise to love, honor, and obey."

We arrived at the same time in order to be aboard and leave, as the weather was still good. David sat down and didn’t say a word. He had this grin that I hadn’t seen before. I figured he had taken a snort of alcohol or a pain pill. Either way, I wasn’t going to let it hamper my weekend.
When we landed in Montana, the guide we hired was there to pick us up. He held a sign and we waved to get his attention. No guns were allowed on this trip. All we had was a camera. Our first day out, we stood on a ridge overlooking a valley. Snow was everywhere. A few Elk ran across the snow. Once in a while, you would spot a wolf. The back of the ridge had a shear face to it. It not only helped to block out the wind, but it gave us an advantage for wild animals.
Sam was telling us how wolves would come into the camp at night and our best protection was the fire and his 30/30. He was the only one allowed to carry a rifle. The temperature would drop to a nice cold of ten below zero. That is the wind chill figure in. Our sleeping bags would keep us good and warm.
During the night, we heard all the howls they made. When one started, it soon became to at least a dozen. That night no one slept through all the howling. David had gotten in his sleeping bag early. He thought they couldn’t get to him there. Well, I sure wasn’t going to be dragged off without a fight.
The sun was just breaking the ridge of the highest mountain peak. Below it was finally getting light enough to see the shadows of the trees and movement. This was what we had been waiting for. Three wolves were on the hunt, after a buck Elk who was out running them by a margin. I took pictures of the hunt. We’d never seen one taken down the whole time.
The Coleman stove was popping now and the sound of bacon frying brought me closer to the pot of coffee that had been heating up. The rest of the week seemed to fly by so fast. We both didn’t want to leave. At least I could have stayed on another week. I believe David was ready to go when we got talking about the wolves. He was sitting there with that grin and it really bothered me. It wasn’t like him to sit and not respond to anything we talked about.
I must have used ten roles of film and eaten so much bacon and drank so much coffee. I guess I gained a few pounds from all of this.
Once we started back, David still sat with that grin on his face. I do believe he was possessed. I know one thing, he won’t have a lot to tell his wife, other than the photos I took. Some people are built for the outdoors and are just like the wolves, who love a good hunting party."

The secret to its perfection is in the deep-frying, for this way it gets evenly cooked leaving no part of the strips without the savory, greasy texture to sate any bacon lover’s palate. It’s salty, hickory, greasy, piggy, the deep-fried smell fills my snout, as I grab a large rick and set it next to their best friends- the fried eggs. Drool starts to run out the corner of my mouth. I quickly wipe it away with my shirt-sleeve as I move on to the next item.
This would be the home-style hash browns. These are cooked in butter to a crispy golden-brown on the outside, but leaving the inside slightly gooey as the starch, separating from the potatoes, combines with the butter. I also detect the pungent smell of garlic mixed with the salt and pepper and added to the hash browns- for an extra kick. These smells rise in waves to join the others starting to overload my olfactory receptors, as I grab a large clump.
“You’re not done yet,” I hear the French toast call. I hurry on. The frenchtoast is comprised of large, inch-thick slices of real French bread soaked in a mixture of thickly whipped raw eggs, milk, a pinch of salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and a couple teaspoons of vanilla. Then it’s cooked to a splotchy yellow-brown on each side. This all coalesces into a poignant combination of rich, fatty, yeasty, salty-sweet, eggnoggy, nutty, woodsy, bitter, spicy extravaganza with everything else for my nose and taste buds ( which I feel are already dancing on my tongue with anticipation). Snagging a couple slices, I also add two big tablespoons full of powdered-sugar, a jigger of hot, melted butter and a pint pitcher of hot, real, maple syrup. Hmm,Hmm,Hmm! I almost run to the table so I can stuff my face with this bounty. I hold myself back, so I don’t spill any of it.
Sitting down, I’m reminded by the rich scent of freshly brewed coffee that has edged its way back into my nostrils, to pour myself a cup (adding four sugar cubes), and a glass of cold milk and one of freshly-squeezed, pulpy, tangily-sweet orange juice (to satisfy my daily vitamin-c needs).
I bow my head and give thanks to the ultimate provider of this bounty; ask a blessing on it, the preparers of it and on myself for good health. Amen!
I start by taking my knife and fork in hand, make small cuts all over the two slices of French toast, sprinkle them with the powdered- sugar, pour the hot butter over them (watching as it mingles with the powdered-sugar, clumping up together), and then I smothered it with the hot, maple syrup (making sure I get it saturated into the cuts for maximum impact).
With everything finally in readiness I dig-in. I cut-out a piece of egg, and join it with some bacon and hashbrowns and a slice off the french toast. I bring this carefully to my nose breathing the scents deeply in, enjoying them immensely, and stuff it all in my eager mouth…
…Bang! Bang! Bang!
“Hey celly, wake up! It’s breakfast time, you don’t wanna miss out on the cold, lumpy oatmeal, dry toast, and canned fruit-cocktail. The state’s taken a lot of trouble to provide it for us. Come on. All you’re doing up there is dreaming anyway.”
I moan loudly covering my head with my pillow wanting to cry. I can still feel that first bite tickling my tongue and smell all the scrumptious odors of the best breakfast ever.
I’ve been dreaming again. The same dream (or near enough) I’ve been having at least once a week for the last thirty years when I’m incarcerated.
I can’t stop it either. Talk about self-imposed torture!
The worst!"

I used to love talking and flirting with them, and they responded in kind. I was a typical street punk rocker, wearing torn clothing, leather, chains, and spokes. They loved my brightly colored hair-dos.
Though I never secured their “services,” I did pay them a few bucks to buy me booze when I was a teenager. I’d sit on those pissy El stop steps, drinking and talking to them for hours. Most of them were just trying to make money the best way they could, considering their circumstances. More often than not, they came from broken homes and abusive backgrounds and had addictions and/or kids to support. I could really relate to them and found their lifestyles romantic.
Prostitutes still hold a special place in my heart. I’ve always wanted to write a romance novel about a “hooker with a heart of gold” but hear it’d be too trie. Maybe some day, I’ll find a way to write a story worthy of paying tribute to those “working girls” who fascinated me all those years ago."

Is life just a game of fate, or is life a choice we make? Do we choose the path we take or is our path just a chance that changes from day to day? Or do we just endure a Monday through Friday, nine-to-five job to create normality? Do we withstand normality while we seek what is said to be our “true passion”?
What is love? Is love an almighty power or just a feeling? Do we love to live, or live to love? Do we abide by God’s word as He says, “...to love one another as we love ourselves?” Do we live a life we love or is love just an idea of beauty in an insecure world that most want and need without option? Beauty?! Who is to say what beauty is? Does beauty come with a cost? I have to answer yes, a huge cost!
Many questions, few needs, and an abundance of confusions plague the mind of the intriguing young woman. Still, peaceful and content, she falls into her spell and is enchanted by her beauty as if she were on the other side of the mirror gazing at her reflection.
With just a glance, one could define her by the various colors she wore in an exquisite disguise. Another may absorb her thoughts, judge her choices, and debate her actions that brought her to this particular place in life. Others would ask, “Why would she stop here to rest? Why would one choose to reveal and express her elegant smooth curves that flow without restriction?” Only the angel can look upon her with eyes of innocence. Pure, taintless, and without fault.
Could it be her eyes of dark glee that enchant us? Shaped to attract the lustful with lashes that flurry with every wink? Could they pierce a path straight into the core of our soul, taking a glimpse of what we cannot reveal? What expressions she renders lost in deep thought. As she returns to reality, she catches the shadow of an angel’s wings.
Her thoughts begin to diminish as the cool breeze lift her strands and swishes them about. Hesitating to rake them away, she stares onward. She gazes not out of fear, but to ponder what may be her next deed.
Does she not realize that a storm slowly creeps upon her? Does she not feel the cool air flow through the follicles of her silky hair? Does she not notice the sun’s rays being diminished by the oncoming clouds of deep gray? Is she not afraid of the evil of her world?
Unlikely. On this day, her beauty has calmed the beast.
What is her next step? Where does she plan to go? When will she step outside of her domain to encounter her final destination? Will the storm wash her away into the river waters below or will she seek shelter for this night?
Crashing rage of the distant river waters rush on as the endless existence of life prevails beyond the weathered banks. But where water attracts life, life attracts death and death ultimately results with new life. All around us, no matter where we search, we find life continues cyclically. Time continues to pass. Where we go from here is at our own free will.
With the name of a lady and wings like a bird, she comes out of her shell showing her world that things are not as they may seem. Will she make her glorious flight just to rest on another graceful life form? Will she charm another beast and enchant with her devastating beauty? We will never know for time is precious she must move on.
She creeps forward slowly seeking a higher altitude for her soft silky skin. When a crack in her shell separates and her wings unfurl, she reveals her full abilities to all who gaze upon her. In that moment, the cool breeze excels and she takes flight. In an instant she is gone and the lady bird begins a new chapter in life.
What beauty life brings unexpectedly to a female sapion in lure on a park bench after an exhausting pursuit with the loves of her life: dance, performance, and the beauty of expression. She watches as tiny life forms live without worry, only to become overtaken by worries of her own. What will she accomplish within the new sunrise?"

Darby laughed. Lyssa always liked hearing her friend laugh. It was always genuine, always loud, and always infectious. “What?”
Reaching over, Darby grabbed Lyssa’s banded wrist, gently lifting it while she brought her’s to match them. Releasing Lyssa’s wrist, she pointed to the matching purple ones on each wrist.
“Tom Larsen,” Lyssa laughed.
“Yep,” Darby said. “Most of the girls got one from him, but we all know who he will take. So I guess you really have two, and only three for me.”
“It doesn't matter. I wasn’t going to give it back to him for consideration anyway. It’d be funny if no girls gave him back their band.”
“Would be, wouldn’t it,” Darby agreed. “He’d probably just go to the dance himself and act like that’s what he planned anyhow.”
Lyssa started to pull her hand back, but Darby grabbed her wrist again.
“Hey, what’s this drab tan looking band and who gave it to you?”
Jerking her hand away and placing it on her lap, Lyssa covered the band with her other hand. “It’s Khaki, I think, and Jerry Rollins OFFERED it to me,” Lyssa said.
“And you accepted it?”
“What was I supposed to do? It’s not like I’m committed to going to the dance with him as long as I don’t give it back. Besides, he might’ve given out other bands. I’m sure I’m not the only one he would ask.” Except, she felt fairly certain she was the only one. She remembered the tentative, quiet use of her name, surprised to see him standing before her desk, hand held out, the band dangling from it.
She remembered the look in his eyes. Not exactly fear of rejection, though she did sense some of that. It went deeper-a hoped for relationship with someone who understood, someone who might not judge, someone whom he could confide who might need to confide in him as well. Lyssa felt no expectation from him. Jerry’s eyes changed little as she accepted the band and he wordlessly left; but they did change.
“Well, what if you are?” Darby asked.
Lyssa plucked unconsciously on the Khaki band. “What if I am what?”
Darby threw her arms up. “Duh, if you ARE the only one Jerry offered the band to. You know…What we were just talking about!”
“What does it matter, Darby? Why’re you so fixated on it?”
Fist clenched, Lyssa brought her wrist up and shook it in her friend’s face. “I’ve got three bands, Darby! Three! It’s not like Jerry Rollins is the only guy who might want to take me to the dance.”
“Geez, Lyssa, I didn’t mean…I mean…”
At her friend’s stricken look, Lyssa dropped her arm back into her lap. “Forget it darby. Just forget it.”
“But--”
“Darby, please.”
They sat quietly, Lyssa staring at the ground; and Darby, head tilted back against the backrest, looking for shapes in the clouds. “You know, he really has no friends,” Darby broke the silence. Still staring at the clouds, she continued, “he distances himself from everyone.”
“I know.”
“Don’t get me wrong. He’s not a bad looking guy.”
“No, he’s not.”
“But he is, you know, kinda standoffish.”
“We know nothing about him. He may have his reasons,” Lyssa said. She hated lying to Darby, but couldn’t say anything without letting her own secret out. Lyssa’s friends knew her mom and dad were separated and knew she lived with her mom. They didn’t know why her parents were separated.
Jerry did.
When Lyssa last got to visit her father at the Colton Federal Law, she spotted Jerry across the room. His father sat across from him in the same khaki uniform her father wore. Like her, he must’ve moved to Colton with his mom to be closer; and, like her, tried to keep his father’s incarceration secret.
Lyssa didn’t know if he’d seen her until he gave her the band for the dance.
“So, do you know what you’re going to do?” Darby asked.
“About what?”   “The dance, Lyssa.”
Lyssa’s mind raced. So many questions, so many fears, so many unknowns. How easy to skip the dance altogether. How easy to tear the bands from her wrist and trash them. As all the possibilities clogged her mind, she continued to pluck the drab, khaki band as one might pluck the strings of a harp. The band that resonated the most with her."

My father, the sperm donor, plan and simple was a drunk. Not only that, he was a mean drunk and a coward who, today, would have been arrested for any number of criminal actions, but in those days of children--and wives--being seen and not heard, it was open season.
The sperm donor wasn’t all bad though. He left his scotch in plain sight so that I could steal a sip every now and then in the time I was 14 until I graduated from High School and joined the Army.
He taught me how to deal with pain on many levels and how to take disappointment and accept it without crying, or at least wishing that I could gain things that were unattainable--at least as far as he was able to ascertain, because as far as he was concerned, I would probably fail at anything that I tried.
He taught me how to turn hatred into action; and anger into idealism.
It was interesting that after my stepmother and I compared notes many years later, I was also to find that he was insecure in many ways as well. We both figured that he had played us against each other so that we would never become allies and be able to team up against him.
We both realized that he was a narcissist and misogynist who tried to destroy anything that could be better than he was. One would think that most parents would want their children to achieve more than they have in life and that they would be supportive of that concept. The sperm donor, we decided, if he could, would have created all sorts of situations to insure that his children, especially his oldest son, would be a failure.
So when I think of my parents, I think of the young woman who was conned into having a child at 15 or 16 and who was robbed of life and the ability to spend time with her son. I think of years of abuse and neglect; tortures of a drunk who thought that it was his right to punish his children in ways that were criminal, but he knew that he could get away with it because children of a certain generation did not have any voice.
I think of extremely talented, creative children who, if he had been more secure in his manhood, would have done great things in their lives. Most of all, I think of how hard it was to raise myself and to embark on a lifetime of trial and error before I was finally able to find myself.
There is one thing that I can thank my parents for however; they taught me how to be a different parent than they were, so that when I had children of my own, I knew exactly what not to do.
I learned how to nurture my children, how to support them in their efforts to be individuals...to be unique. I was able to teach them how to be parents for their children, how to love and respect them as being more than just children, but more importantly, small human beings who have rights and who deserve dignity, and honor, and the ability to grow into the adults that they are destined to become if they are given the right guidance, support, and love.
Most of all, I had to learn how to forgive, if I was ever going to become anything but a person who took the sins of the past and allowed them to define all that I would become in the present and future.
I wonder sometimes, if my life would have been much better had I come from the perfect loving family. Then I look into the mirror and see how far I have come and know how far I wish to go in life, despite being confined, and I am somehow glad that I had the upbringing that I had for it built character, and inner strength, and calluses on my spirit that I might not have been able to grow otherwise.
So, I suppose that I have one other thing that I can thank my parents for...I would not be the evolved man that I am today, had I not had to wade through the waters of life that I had to deal with when I was a child. When people try to appease me by acting as if they pity my young life, I tend to look at them with disdain. I don’t ask for their pity, or sympathy, or any of that.
Had it not been for that hard life that I once had, I would not be able to deal with the situation that I find myself in today. When I look in the mirror, I don’t see a reflection of my parents… I just see a person who I actually have learned to like...all I see is me."

There may be desire, but the lack of caring leaves things only temporary. The singer/dancer/actor has no knowledge of the girl/boy “fan” that “loves” them. Nothing in this is destined to be long-term, for we each at one time or another favored a celebrity at one point, but later moved on to other things. We each, the celebrity (fame/fortune) and the fan got used out of that sort of “love, ”and use is the opposite of the kind of love, true love; we are each meant to seek in our lives.
The third mental/emotional exercise is to fonder the case of a man/woman donating to a charity, a soup kitchen, a homeless shelter, or some good person in need. There is plenty of caring, but less, or no, admiring and/or desirings. Charity and pity are good things, to be sure, but a relationship of true love cannot live on charity or caring alone. Even though it is necessary for charity and such, ultimately there is some dependent need on the fact that someone that request a donation, and some amount of use, though perhaps appropriate necessary, in this kind of relationship, and use is the opposite of the kind of true love we seek in meeting someone for the first time off of some internet site or app.
There are many combinations of these three ingredients for true love that exist in differing ratios for many types of human, and humane, love in the world, but, we must be able to identify each ingredient; admiring, desiring, caring in order to see when each is in the right balance, in both words and deeds, for ourself and for the other person with which we meet and plant the seeds of hope for true love. Life is full of lessons for each of us, and we can review each past relationship in our life and see which ingredients were out of-balancing; too much admiring on one person’s part, too much desiring on this other person’s part, not enough caring at other times. Reflection is good for healing your heart, take some time to think about these three ingredients in your future hopes for true love. We each hunger both to love and to be loved in return.
Admiring, desire, and caring - but never just using or being used - this is true love’s recipe. Get cooking."

We parked our cars in the designated areas and began our journey upward. I had never hiked there before, yet I was chosen to lead my small crew through unmarked trials of unimagined destinations.
Why I was chosen to decide which path to take at every fork, I have no clue. I was the youngest. As mentioned, the others were college graduates already.
Fork after fork presented themselves, I began to wonder why we had been hiking in circles, for each fork highly resembled the previous one. At about noon, we stopped on the way for a lunch break, sitting on 2 large fallen oaks, wedged between 2 gigantic rocks. It was a lowly natural setting for tea, comfortable for all 4 of us.
The sun crept through the tall thick foliage lighting up our much-needed flunch rendezvous. We had walked for so long and so far, since morning, and we rested while we ate and drank, not worrying about the weather or the time. Finishing, we continued our voyage to the top of the mountain.
None of us seemed to notice how much time had passed by. One moment, we were having a leisurely lunch, and the next, we arrived at a plateau at the top of the mountain, and it was so dark outside that we saw nothing but stars! There were so many of them that one couldn’t help but continue to stare. As we gazed up, a noisy helicopter came into view, getting ready to land on the beautiful plateau we had finally reached. Dust began to fly everywhere as the helicopter landed just a few feet away from where we stood. Just then, Bret, who had gone ahead to scout the area, announced that there was a cliff just ahead. “Oh, lovely,” I thought. Had this helicopter not landed to pick us up, just now, in our states of utter exhaustion, having hiked the entire day, we very well may have ended up at the bottom at the 1000-foot cliff!
Thank God, someone was watching over us! At the sound of the helicopter engine, with the flying dust and the news of the 1000-foot cliff drop just ahead, I promptly fainted. Therefore, I regretfully missed the helicopter ride down the mountain to our cars, the drive home, and I did not wake up until shortly after we arrived home. I woke up on my fiancé’s couch, wondering how I slept through it."

Jasmine is really in her blues this morning, unaware that apartment 3A is no longer unoccupied as she sings, or at least tries to sing, at the top of her lungs… “Sunshine, Blue Skies, please go away… my man has found another… and gone away… with him went my future… my days are filled with gloom… so day after day… I stay locked up in my room… and… I know to you it might sound strange… but I wish it would rain… oh, how I wish that it would rain”.
Her blues stem from her 393 frame, low self-esteem, low morals and the loss of yet another boyfriend. All her life she has been a Big girl, people have ridiculed her for her weight, her family included! Though she is very beautiful, she has been told by haters that she is ugly, been called Ms. Piggy, told she stinks (which is untrue).
She’s never really had a true friend or really known love, everyone has always used her for what they can get and them thrown her away like trash. Seems like life has always give her crap!

Enters Apt. 3A -

Marcellus, lays in his bed wondering what could of caused this female next door so much pain? He reflects on the last few months of his life that lead him here to Silver Springs, Maryland.
Marcellus comes from a good family of God-fearing Christians, he has known nothing but love. Good-looking, athletically built and well-spoken. He dated women you would consider supermodel material, but they were not wifey material and at the age of 30, he is tired of short-lived romances. After re-dedicating himself to the Lord, he decided change was in order, and God must of agreed with him because he put it on Marcellus’ heart to pack up and move to Silver Springs, MD.
Ever the obedient one, he did not question it, he went to visit his family and told them what God wanted him to do, with his family’s support he found a job and a place to live.
“You know what?” Marcellus says to himself, “Let me go introduce myself to my neighbor.”

Apt. 3B -

Knock, knock, knock!!
Jasmine has just gotten out of the shower, she goes to the door and looks through the peephole. “Who is this fine brother at my door” she says to herself!
“Who is it?” she says!
“Hello, my name is Marcellus and I’m your new neighbor from 3A” he says to the closed door.
Jasmine not wanting him to see her 393 pound frame says, “I’m not decent, what can I do for you?”
“Oh, I’m sorry. I was just introducing myself. I won’t bother you, you have a blessed day!”
He strolls back to his apartment and thought as he entered “I don’t even know her name”.
Jasmine leans against her door, hating herself for being so insecure… but she knows in her heart he would never want her, so she decided as usual, she’d avoid that fine brother!
3 weeks go by and Marcellus has even seen his neighbor, by the time he gets in from work, she’s already in her apartment, locked in like someone on house arrest! He speaks to his sister about it and she advises him to slip a getting to know you dinner invitation into her mailbox or under her door, “be sure to invite her boyfriend just in case she has one” she says. “Yeah sis, I like that idea, I’ll set it /up for this weekend.”
Jasmine gets home to find a card inviting her to dinner in Apt. 3A under her door when she enters her apartment. “I can’t believe this, what am I going to do?”, “You know what, fine, fine, I’ll get this over with, he’ll see me and make an excuse right then and there why he has to cancel this dinner”, “If I’d opened my door when he first came over, I wouldn’t be going through this hurt again”.
She cleans up, gets dressed and heads over to Apt. 3A, standing outside his door she can barely hear some jazz playing… she thinks, wow he is fine and has taste, my favorite kind of music, she chuckles to herself, “reminds me of the Cosby show, how he’d put on this music and dance with his wife”, “God, I wish I could be Claire Huxtabe”.
Okay girl, let’s get this over with… knock, knock, knock!!

Inside Apt. 3A - (Part 2)

On the phone with his Mom, “Ma, I don’t know if she is going to show up, but if she doesn’t, most of this food is going to feed a few homeless people I saw a few blocks over by the park”, “Well baby, whatever happens, just know it’s God’s will” his mom says! Knock, knock, knock!! “Oh, Ma, gotta go. I believe she’s here”. “Okay baby, call me later”, “Okay, bye!”.
Marcellus opens his door, standing before him is this beautiful woman with mocha brown skin and hazel brown eyes, all he can do is stare at her!
Jasmine mistakes his stare as one of shock and disgust, she lets her eyes fall to her feet then turns away to go home and cry!
Marcellus snaps out of it and runs after her saying, “Hey, wait a minute, where are you going so fast?”. Jasmine doesn’t look back, she says “listen, I know now that you’ve seen me you have other things to do, sorry if I ruined your appetite”. “Wait.. what?” says Marcellus, “Hold up a second please, miss?”, “I don’t know what I did wrong, and I don’t even know your name”, “Can you please just speak to me for a moment?”.
Jasmine stops outside her door with her key inches from the lock and looks back at him and can see in his eyes that he is sincere, she lets out a pent-up breath and says, “Are you sure you want to speak to me?”. “Yes”, he said!
“Shall we speak here in the hall or would you mind coming inside and sitting at my dinner table with me? Cause I’m famished!”
Jasmine smiled and said “First my name isn’t miss, it’s Jasmine, Ms. Jackson if you must”... that got a hearty laugh out of Marcellus, she loved the way he laughed, genuine, not fake like everyone else. “And”, she said, “I’d hate to keep a hungry man from eating”.

Inside Apt. 3A -

“You have very good taste and style, didn’t know men knew how to decorate”, “Well thank you Jasmine, Ms. Jackson if you must” he said with a wide smile… God, she loved his smile! She said “Okay, Mr. Comedian, you’ve got jokes”.
They sat and talked for a while, she picked at her food, and when he asked if she didn’t like his cooking, she said “it tastes delicious but I don’t need to be eating with my fat butt”... when he didn’t laugh or smile, she said “What?”.
He said, “Jasmine, why do you do that?”. “Do what?”. “Put yourself down like that, don’t you know you are beautiful?!”. “Oh I get it, you are one of those chubby chasers and once you get what you want you dump her and move on” she said!
Marcellus was hurting inside for this woman who didn’t even know her own worth… he said “Jasmine, I can tell you have been hurt deeply throughout your life, never being shown how special you truly are, never being loved for who you are”. “Who are you Jasmine, do you know”. As he spoke, tears filled her beautiful eyes and began to cascade down her cheeks… Marcellus went on. “I was raised to love everyone, not see color or body types, only the good and bad in people”. “I’m not a ‘hit it and quit it’ type of man, I try to make my relationships last because I want more than what today’s women have to offer.''
“Jasmine, God leads my life, He shows me things, and right now, He shows me that your heart has been damaged over the years, but that a good heart beats inside of you”. “No it does not” she cries, “how can I have a good heart when it has been torn out of me” she says as she gets up and rushes out of his apartment back to Apt. 3B and slams her door.
Marcellus doesn’t see Jasmine again for two weeks, his knocks go unanswered, so he starts leaving letter under her door, with beautiful greeting cards, letting her know she’s somebody, she’s special, that God loves her and so does he!
Everyday, Jasmine comes in to find a letter or card from the fine brother in Apt. 3A, she smiles to herself, she even began to believe the words coming from the letters and cards, people at work have begun to notice the Big woman in the middle office walk with her head up and her shoulders straight back, with a confident look on her face like she knew something they didn’t.
Marcellus was helping this beautiful woman come into herself piece by piece!

Inside Apt. 3A - (Part 3)

Marcellus is having Bible Study over the phone with his family when he hears a quiet knock on his door, without interrupting his father he gets up and answers his door, Jasmine is standing there with roses in her hand, he looks surprised but quietly ushers her inside. With his fingers to his lips, he leads her to the couch where his Bible is open and his phone is on speakerphone, his Dad is saying “So in the book of James Chapter 2, is telling us that we are not to show favoritism cause it’s a sin, and we are to love our neighbors as ourselves, Amen?” Marcellus says “Amen!” Jasmine sits there taking this all in with awe! Before his Dad hangs up, he says “Son we have to let people know that when Life gives us Trash we have to make Treasures of it, God turns around everything the devil uses for bad into some for good, remember that” “Yes sir” Marcellus says, and then his Dad says when do we get to meet this special Lady jasmine you have been talking so much about?” “Uh, oh, ah” Marcellus can’t get the words out with Jasmine sitting there, her mouth open… “Um Dad, I really have to go now”, “alright Son, I love you, read the Book of Deuteronomy. Chapter 30 for our next Bible Study”. “Yes sir, love you too”. “God Bless You Son”.
Jasmine who is totally speechless has forgotten about the roses she’s been holding, Marcellus who is blushing like a lovesick teenager says “Are those for me?” “Oh, sorry, yes, yes they are… for all you’ve done for me all these weeks”, “and just so you know I looked up all those Bible verses you wrote to me and they opened my eyes to know that I am truly loved, I learned to forgive others and myself, to leave the past in the past and look forward to those things ahead”.
Marcellus was quietly thanking God as Jasmine spoke, God had guided his actions and given him the words to write all these weeks to her.
They sat quiet for a few minutes just looking at one another, then Jasmine spoke first “Marcellus, I don’t know where this goes from here but I’ll be forever grateful to god for putting you in Apt. 3A and my life!” “Jasmine, whatever God has planned for our lives will be, I just pray that whatever it is, we are in one anothers lives!”

One year later -

“Baby you know we don’t need to move out of this apartment right?” Jasmine asks her husband Marcellus of three months, he says, “Honey, I’ve enjoyed living in apartment 3A with you these past three months but our babies you are carrying will need some space, plus you’re having triplets and I know my Mom and Dad will be here often to spend time with and help us with the babies”, “Don’t forget you sisters and brothers too, I love your family so much”, “and they love you too Mrs. Case”. “Baby it’s still hard to believe your name is Marcellus Justin Case”, “I know, I was the one on the receiving end of the jokes growing up but love got me through!” “Thank you, for rescuing me” says Jasmine!
Jasmine was saved, a good heart and love is all that’s required, now you readers show your love and good heart to someone today.
God Bless You All!"

He informed me that my brother had passed away. How could that be? He was four years younger than me. He was healthy and fit. After all he was a fireman and a paramedic. How could he be dead? Cancer; I didn’t even know he was sick. I never got to say goodbye. I never got to personally say, “Brother, I’m sorry, I love you.” There will be no reunion with my brother when I get out. I feel such a loss. We use to be so close. I never thought he would die. But there it is, part of prison life.
Four years into my incarceration I got called into the Captain’s office. My mom didn’t have much time to live. I was allowed one call to say goodbye. The last time I saw my mom was close to two years ago. I use to call her every week, and I knew she was sick with cancer. A few days after I said goodbye, she passed away. There will be no reunion between mother and son when I get out. My heart aches and now her husband is slowly closing the door on our relationship. Just like the others.
The only family I have left is my youngest brother. He won’t write me, and I can’t write him. He told my family never to give me his address. About a year ago my aging father decided to rebuild our relationship. And I am thrilled that now his wife is starting to write me. I thank God. Deep down I think we realize that we may not have too much time left. I love them both and pray that someday they can visit me.
Then there’s my dog Fred. He’s getting on in age. I got him as a puppy 12 years ago. He’s an old dog. I guess he’s 84 dog years old now. I guess I won’t be taking him for long walks along the beach; no dog parks.
Damn! I hate prison. I hate the losses. I hate the pain I have in my heart. This is the worst punishment man can set upon another man. To take him away from his family, his loved ones, their life. But it’s my fault. I brought this onto myself.
So I’m lying in my bunk trying to come to terms with all my losses. And the losses to come. The material stuff I can deal with. I’ve lost stuff before. But losing brothers, mothers, fathers, and my dog; I can’t get them back. There won’t be a grand family reunion when I get out of prison. No party. Just me alone.
But then I think, “Yes, someday there will be a family reunion.” When I’m older. When it’s my turn to die. My soul will leave my body and go to wherever souls tend to wander off to. And then we’ll have our reunion. My soul will be greeted by my brother, my mom, my dad, and yes, even Fred will be there. We will bask in the never ending love we share, and we will be reunited once again."
1140,"""Against all Odds"" by Nate Lindell",,No,2017.0,06 - June,Word Theme Essay,https://www.notion.so/Accomplishments-40b534ffdc084c9f86ff25f45d76e8c5,Katie Kwak,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrrFATKfGfyGNnhpBTgRmVemtTIaxogbJbCdgyq5180/edit,No,"When I entered the WI prison system, my writing ability was scored at the 12.9 grade level on the TABE. But I despised writing and would have scowled at anyone who suggested I write anything beyond personal letters.
After a good 1,000 pages of legal writing, I realized that I needed to master our language to be a skilled litigator. And poetry is the heart of any language.
There was a story I recalled, about Sylvester Stallone having recited Edgar Allen Poe’s poems to help him overcome his speech impediment. I did as Stallone did, recited Poe’s poems, which I found intriguing. I ended up reading everything I could get of Poe’s.
Thus began...three, five years of liberal-arts self-education, made possible by free books sent to me by stores that sent books to prisoners at no cost.
I studied the origin and history of English poetry, classic lit., essay writing, rhetorical principles. E.g., I wrote out copies of On Writing Well, Creating Short Fiction, and took extensive notes and quotes from books on mathematics, anthropology, psychology, etc.
Writing the material out, I found, made it stick to my noodle better, and made the info available when the book was gone.
I had no visitors (other than a soul-severing Jehovah’s witness, who was effectively an anti-visitor), no T.V., and usually no one around me to socialize with. It was hard time, hurt me emotionally, psychologically; but I fought it by educating myself.
It was obvious to anyone with eyes that the rural folk running this place (the WI Secure Program Facility, W-S.P.F) were intent on making us miserable, degrading us, so they’d feel better about their own sorry lots in life–turning keys, looking at prisoner’s buttholes for contraband, writing misspelled tickets because a prisoner had a ketchup packet isn’t something you want to be lauded for at your funeral.
Know their ill will fueled my effort at developing my artistic and intellectual abilities.
There came a point when psychology staff didn't want to talk with me. One once said, “Why are you asking me? You know more than me!”–and she said it sadly, not sarcastically.
I persuaded the head psychologist here–Dr.Scott Rubin-Asch–to do an I.Q. test on me, figuring if it was high enough, maybe mensa’d let me join and I could find some intellectual companionship. Dr.Rubin-Asch did four sub-tests for the WAIS-4, through the glass, in a visiting booth. Afterwards, he said he’d do the remaining subtests the next day.
It was a year before he again saw me, at which time he did the full he did the full WAIS-3, not the WAIS-4.
He dragged out telling me the results for another several months.
When he eventually told me the results of the WAIS-4 sub-tests (“all scores were in the exceptionally high range”) and that my full-scale I.Q. score on the WAIS-3 was 144, I realized why he’d waited a year to finish testing and used the WAIS-3, not the WAIS-4.
From studying statistics, I knew that my score was one point shy of being two standard deviations above the high-end of average. You only need one standard deviation above average (i.e. 130 points) to be eligible for Mensa. It’s like that my score was higher than Dr.Rubin-Asch’s, which–given that I’m only three-fifths of a human–likely offended his comforting delusion of superiority.
With my I.Q. tests done, I implemented my behavior-modification program–the “High-Risk Officer Program”.
Apparently they disliked my program, because they shipped me off to federal custody…
My art, which I continue practicing, drastically improved. You can see samples of it on https://www.prisoninmates.com/NateLindell303724. Two collections of my poems and songs, and the start of a volume of creepy stories are also there.
My writing and my art/drawings impress everyone who reads or sees them.
With no familial support, with no money, with a life sentence, with over 14 years of solitary confinement eating at me, with a few friends and many hates/enemies, it seems to me that a person may still accomplish a lot.
Maybe–although I hold little hope of it–American society will come to respect my struggle against all odds, respect me as a human being, and permit me to join in a society that’s worth me being a port of. My talent, I think, could be put to better use than suing and writing about prison staff’s crimes against humanity

K-Town had screwed up morning count when he dropped dead from a heart attack. The guards called the infirmary, but they couldn’t come because they were too short of staff to send anyone. The guard couldn’t carry K-Town to the infirmary because he couldn’t leave his duty post. There were no other guards available to carry K-Town to the infirmary, because the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is perpetually short of staff. K-Town died on the floor of Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit of TDCJ because there was nobody available to save him. This works both ways. In January 2003, Officer Stan Wiley died in a similar way. Wiley deserved it but K-Town did not. June 1st was K-Town’s birthday.
Bureaucracy screwed up the Wednesday lunch schedule. The guard still had K-Town on the building count sheet, although K-Town wasn’t in the building. Bureaucracy took two and a half hours to finally deduce that K-Town was not in his proper place. One of the building captains ordered a guard to write K-Town up for being ‘out of place.’ Yeah, K-Town would have felt ‘out of place’ en route to Peckerwood Hill, his home...if K-Town could have felt anything.
It was a most wonderful Wednesday morning to be in prison. It wasn’t so wonderful for K-Town. That didn’t matter, for K-Town was no longer on any TDCJ count sheet, so he wasn’t one of us in prison. K-Town would never be a recidivist. He was truly liberated. He was free at last.
Unit gossip revolved around the status of K-Town. How does the administration count that unauthorized departure? Do they count that as parole? Does the administration count the Angel of Death as equivalent to the Parole Board in Austin? If K-Town fails to report to his parole officer, is a Blue Warrant automatically issued? Will Texas extradite K-Town from hell so he can finish those final fifty days of his sentence? K-Town probably prays for extradition. It’s supposed to be ninety-six degrees in Amarillo. That’s cooler than K-Town’s new cell. Hell probably has no televisions, no dayrooms, and no coffee...Hold up! Did you say no coffee? Ain’t that unconstitutional!
It was a most wonderful Wednesday morning to be in prison. You had coffee. You could drink it in the dayroom. You could watch television. Did you say it’s hotter than hell? Ask K-Town about that."

The girl stared at me, her big sad eyes colored like the forest greens she seemed to feel pain that wouldn’t rest.
Amazed, I realized I did feel like slide from that simple twig that lay among tangled vines. I tore at my lip as tears hit. I tasted blood a bit, my teeth shredding my cheek. “I’m sorry...I didn’t...I mean, I feel and I didn’t mean to-”
“Man never means to,” the girl sighed, “but you always do. Kill, take, shatter and break...as long as it serves you, you don’t care that it hurts, these things you chose.”
Stunned, flummoxed; I truly felt like a great lummox. She spoke true and I didn’t know what to do. This sprite, so like a child, had the wisdom of the wild. I wanted to understand but I could not demand, thus I did plead: “Show me what to change and how to be.”
“Feel, help life grow,” she beamed; a child no more than nine, though I thought I’d had a young woman envisioned as a fairy in my mind. “Be true. Stand bold, teach others to talk and dance with trees. Then you’ll truly be free.”
I had to ask. “What’s your name?”
“Felicity, not that it will be of gain,” she replied, smiling as if a game was being played.
I couldn’t speak so I dropped to a knee; I wound my fingers around the leaves of a vine I could find crawling between the trees. I found the twig, its pieces parted, yet I felt life somehow restarted.
Felicity vanished from my sight, but still her song took flight in echoes as day became
night. “Dance among the trees and be free. Teach and show the world great dreams. I heard the words on the notes of the song even after the wind carried the sound of pixie pipes far, far off."

Midget’s smile wilted around the edges. Now, he had to go on some suicide mission. ‘If I never would’ve chased that skirt’, thought Midget.
“Okay, so, Rafa’s disappeared. Vic’s disappeared and Georgie’s -”
“Desaparecido,” said Manuel, “todos están desaparecidos. Just like -” snap of his fingers “- all three, gone.”
“¡Ay! Qué carajo, we should f- up them morenos. Give ‘em a real good paliza,” said another voice, to which a chorus of consensus followed. Elie and Julio looked at one another. ‘It can’t be helped,’ they thought.
“¿Qué vamos a hacer?” was everybody’s question. If not, it was some variation of that. Eli, Julio, Gabe and Rafael, locked away all day, had been doing just that: figuring out what to do next.
“Mira hombre,” said Julio. “Vive maybe un poco loco pero es mi hermanito. Georgie’s like a brother too, ¡qué va! Even Rafa’s like family now. I can’t, I won’t, just let this go…” Eli, oh-so-reasonable Eli, had committed the last 3 hours of his being dissuading Julio from going all ‘Rambo.’ It didn’t help that Gabe was all for a little blood letting. Rafael was as good as useless. “Si vamos a la guerra, bueno; si no, pues, también esto me cae bien.” War or not, it didn’t matter.
“¿Estás de mi parte o no?” had been Julio’s final question, an ultimatum really. Of course, Eli was with him, they were all they had, nuestra gente. This probably explains why he’d agreed to Big Apple’s assassination, why he was sneaking out to clip the other zones’ wáter lines, why they had lookouts, strapped up for Mongoose, guarding their line; and, most importantly, why Eli’d helped to plan every step of their offensive.
The problem with prison is nothing’s private. Come up on some dope, people somehow find out. Score some porn, liquor, smokes, or whatever, convicts just knew. There’s always a pair of eyes, scoping; a pair of ears, hustling; a set of lips, loosening. There’s never really any secrets in prison. ‘If not for inquisitive minds then, the rumor mill,’ thought Midget, watching the latinos maneuvering with purpose; they’re up to no good. Just like I was with that red halter top…”
“¿Qué chingada! This is almost as bad as the f-ing torture.’ I was gritting my teeth so hard I was sure I’d crack a molar; physical therapy?! ‘Murphy’d done a number on me.’ I can’t walk without help. ¡Cabrón! I can barely piss without falling off the toilet, I thought. I guess I made out alright, though. Only a couple of things broken, a dislocation or two, plenty of son-to-be scars and flesh wounds, and one good-and-well herniated disk; how the f- am I going to get away? What the f- was I-‘
“Well?” asked Murphy from the doorway. His ‘helper’ (read peon) looked up, whites showing all around his irises – fear? He stammered out, maybe a week or two more. Murphy flew into a rage a minute later. Just myself and an unconscious peon. “I know how to escape?” Yeah, worst lie of my life. I closed my eyes. I still had time.
A thrumming silence fell over Lucky Hole. The wind carrying muted, indistinguishable noises. A quiet prison except for a revitalized plink, plink, plink. Midget meandered his way back. Through and past No Man’s Land watching in every direction. He was just entering his home turf. He could relax a bit. That’s when he fell face forward into a puddle of mud.
‘Mud ain’t red,’ though Midget, holding a bloody hand up to his face.
Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 8
Murphy turned on the shower. As usual, the water took a couple of moments to warm up. Once nude, he climbed in, enjoying the warmth sliding down his chest, paunch, legs, and jumping off his feet. He smiled. ‘Ahhh… Dad may’ve been a son of a bitch but his ass was right. It’s the small things, the small things that -”
“Huh?!” said Tonka. He tapped the faucet, uncomprehending: “what the f-?”
Abdul and Louie were babysitting for Big Apple. He’d spent a week straight watching Deón. They still had to drug him. At the moment, Deón lay unconscious.
“Can you handle him for a minute?” asked Abdul. Lucky Hole had been extra quiet for the past 36 hours. As quiet as it had been before the last war.
“Yeah, sure,” answered Louie, “bring me back some ‘kay?” A nod then, Abdul closed the door. He sighed, “f-…”
“What do you f-ing mean goddamnit?!” demanded Greed. Tonka wasn’t the sharpest blade in the kitchen. Greed had to be certain. He could be wrong, he could be…
Georgie felt the screams reverberating through his wasted frame. Something about the water? What about it? His mind struggled, bringing his scattered intelligence to bear. What was wrong with the water?
Big Apple lay crumpled at Midget’s feet. He had at least 12 stab wounds Midget could see. There had to be more he thought. There was too much blood for the wounds he could see. Midget turned green. He’d seen death from afar, a lot of violence from up close. Seeing Death in her grand leisure and indolent pleasure, seeing her with no make-up or filter. She was gross, gross and shameless. Worse still, Big Apple hadn’t died yet. ‘Holy mother f-ing Christ!’ thought Midget; I should’ve stuck with Danielle.’
“¿Ya se le acabó?” asked Manuel. Gabe was calmer than usual. Joshua looked as if Santa Muerte had claimed skin and bone and kissed him tenderly. Julio… Julio was changed – Sid Vicious incarnate.
Midget burst in on Tonka and Greed mid-discussion. “Big Apple! They… He’s… I-”
“Can’t you see we’re f-ing busy dips-!?” spat Greed.
Midget sucked in a lungful of air, then rapid fired Green and Tonka. The Latinos were up to no good. What exactly? No clue but definitely bad, nasty even. Big Apple lay dead just inside their zone. Ol’ Georgie had gotten himself nabbed by the S.O.’s…
“…and the water didn’t work,” added Tonka matter-of-factly. Midget experienced a sense of vertigo. Just four years ago he’d been walking with Danielle, as happy as a horndog could get. Then, he’d seen that whore of Babylon in lowrider fashion. Then, Danielle had stormed off. Then, he’d gone chasing lowriders. Then, came two years of chasing heroin highs followed by a pharmacy robbery turned all bad. Then, -
“Hey!” yelled Greed, “What. Did. You. Say?” His eyes narrowed like a hawk sighting prey. Midget gulped, “I, I, I’d said, I mean, the Latinos- ”
“No. No, after that.”
“Big Apple’s dead.” The words sat Louie down. He’d been beaten with baseball bats once. But this felt worse. Abdul had left to find Big Apple and came back black and blue. ‘Well, if he hadn’t been so dark he would’ve been,’ though Louie, bitter irony on his tongue. It’d been more than Abdul’s militancy which had saved him. It had been a fierce fight, he explained. Big must’ve taken most of it out of them. Turns out no good deed goes unpunished. Louie sat desolate, in command.
Rafa wheeled through the library. Quiet, abandoned. Nothing changed since Georgie had gotten kidnapped by Murphy’s gang. Rafa had found both his blades and the book he never went without – Of Love and Shadows, by Isabel Allende – along with Teresa’s photo. ‘Wherever Georgie Boy is at,’ thought Rafa, ‘no está contento.’
With Big Apple dead, water lines severed. Victor still missing, Rafa still awol, nobody knew what had happened to Ol’ Gerogie Boy. Lucky Hole’s inhabitants had had just over a month’s supply of life sustaining water. In a matter of 36-hours, that reservoir was reduced to zero. Zero for everyone except the Raza. Still, the die was cast. The final judgement had begun.
Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 9
It’s not often you see a grown man cry, no, openly weep. Rarely ever in prison. Midget had never seen anything like this. There was Greed, literally a mountain of a man, swastika, SS bolts, white power tattoos. More than four notches on his belt. What all good, little prison-bound Aryans aspire to be. There he was, Greed, a pillar of white supremacy. And, he was bawling his eyes out, enraged – over the death of some coon? Tonka wasn’t anywhere close to Hawkins but he knew when a man needed privacy. He did know people. He’d seen the question in Midget’s eyes. He ushered Midget out before the kid could get himself killed.
Sour breath insulted my senses. I opened my eyes, immediately wished I hadn’t. Murphy. His demented mug greeted me, “Well, Georgie Pooh…” his sarcasm was thick, “you’d besta pray to whatever idols you little, brown savages sacrifice to. Because tomorrow, your time’s up. You either get the hell outta here. Or, imma split your ass in two, comprehnday holmes?” Yeah, I got it. Lo comprendo, puto. Only one thought tore through my still addled brain. It sent chills up my spine.
All day after it became common knowledge that the water supply wasn’t limitless. That there was no more water at all. The 300 had a full showing of its talents. Black, whites, boys, Murphy’s numerous peons, and even a few natives all ‘walked the line.’ Desperation drove madness. By sunrise the next day, the smells of copper, cordite, voided bowels and rotting friends soaked heavily throughout Lucky Hole. To some it might seem odd having a burial while so many other corpses littered here and there decomposing. For Louie, Abdul and a few others who could drag themselves from the hopeless abyss, Big Apple’s funeral was an imperative. Even Deón had shaped up for it, still sluggish from the drugs. Louie stood regal, grim, deep in thought. ‘We can annihilate each other or find a way out of this hell hole. Darnell’s death can’t be for nothing. I won’t let it!’
After Marshall Law, the first wars, things had settled. With so much arable land and machinery at their command, what else would you expect red-blooded, good ol’ boys to do? Well, moonshine of course. Idget was drunk, but functioning more or less the same. Lord help him if he could stand without face-planting. Tonka – the loyal enforcer – held his jar, taking small sips, awaiting any attempt. Greed? Well, he was trashed beyond redemption.
“Well,” said Midget thinking, “you know how I came to this here prison?”
“Yeah, yeahs sures…” paused Greed, “didn't cha waste them docs?”
“Yup, at the pharmacy,” replied Greed, “well, there’s a story behind that. And it all starts with that skand Bethany… you recall my old lady Danielle, right? My highschool sweets, bestfriend, tortured martyr in love with a dog? Yeah, so I was curbing my ways, getting serious, trying the whole family thing or whatever. Anywhos, s- was great till I saw her. Dude, she was smoking. Long brown hair, cupid’s bow lips, green-hazel eyes; I mean everything. Sexiest bod… like f- man! Red halter top, dolphin belly button piercing, high heels and those painted on-”
“You know something?” said Greed, “we’re dumbasses.” Then, came a real story.
Sophomore year, Jenna was attending Louisiana State University; Shawnice, Loyola. They shared an apartment close to Loyola in a rough, predominantly black neighborhood. They’d learned long ago racism is colorblind. Whites would hate blacks as quick as browns could hate other browns. What they’d learned freshman year was that the world was full of misogynistic pricks. Darren and Darnell, both highschool freshmen, varsity football players and best friends, were always begging them to come back home. Their sisters always refused. But, they called everyday, no matter what; a hurricane couldn’t change that. Then, they didn’t. One week, then two. Then, a marked police car carrying two giant detectives and a smaller beat cop came. Shawnice had been murdered. How? Gang raped. Jenna had found her. Later, she’d hung herself. Nine black youths from their neighborhood were arrested and later convicted. At trial, it’d come out they’d targeted Shawnice, not for being a lesbian, but for loving a white girl. Their egos could barely stand she didn’t like men. That she didn’t even like black women was too much. They all got 20 years. Darnell became a black revolutionary, a Black Panther…
“…and me, huh… I became a white supremasist and never told my brother how sorry I am,” finished Greed. His eyes closed. He was dead to the world.
Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 10
All hell had broken loose. Fools charging the 300 as if they forgot how effective it had always been. A couple of wars broke out. Old treguas – treaties of necessity – collapsed as people saw their last opportunities for revenge sailing away. The blacks went loco. Some came for us, others for the whites. Almost six days of pandemonium. This may sound real heartless, but I couldn’t give a f- less! The more chaos and confusion there seemed to be in each zone, the more Murphy let me be. Sad to say, but the more other people died, the longer my reprieve. I dreamed about that happy brunette; those butter soft, leather seats, that purring, red European beauty, those smooth, levelled roads. Mostly, I dreamed about taking in that lungful or two of clean, crisp air – no thick, sickly sweet, coppery tinge to it, no meaty-ness, no uncleaned tripas. Just that pure air that swirls pale purples and faded ceruleans after a storm shower. Not even my conscience, battered and bruised as it had been, had anything to say. Just, ‘please Dios, please! Don’t stop, don’t let Murphy remember Ol’ Georgie Boy.’
‘What the hell was I thinking?!’ thought Midget as he cleaned out a few new war wounds; dumbass! Could’ve been at home right now, on Danielle’s parents’ couch, eating Little Debbies’ snacks, watching M.I.L.E Juggs 2. But, nooo… you wanted to go lowrider chasing. Stupid skirt! Stupid small head! Stupid heroin! Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!’ They were fighting the blacks, fighting the Latinos, fighting each other, trying to keep the ship from sinking. Greed had gone awol. Tonka too, and about nine other woods. James and Killer Kyle were in charge. That is, until Killer Kyle lived up to his name again. Now, James was dead and the woodpile scattered. Few held the lid. ‘And for what?’ thought Midget, ‘,more permanent tattoos I’ll never be able to tell my grandkids about?’
Julio never moved with more purpose in his life. He was everywhere, a constant intensity, bordering on madness. Nothing like grief to change a man. Or blood lust to drown his guilt. Which is why Julio lost himself to revenge with complete abandon. Big Apple had only been the first in what was becoming a long line of soon-to-be customers of Revenge-R-Us. Julio brooded, ‘they killed Vic. Killed Georgie. Got Rafa. And I let it happen, I failed you Papá. Lo siento mucho pero te he fracasado Papá.’ It drove his insatiable appetite and he impulsed their movement.
“I don’t like this Tonk,” came the careful whisper.
“It don’t matter. Our general says move, you move or… you can join Brain Dead Joey?” answered Tonka, where there had been a growing murmur of consent. After mention of the chopping block, nobody seemed to think otherwise, all six agreed.
Water was scarce. The Raza maintained an ironclad hold over the water lines. Greed had been siphoning and warehousing water from the beginning. So his circle of loyalists had a small, but good supply. Big Apple, Abdul and Louie had started to do the same. Whoever said it was better late than never was right. They had a slim supply – only enough for drinking. Most went without, dying of thirst or suicide. Those who had, hoarded. Those who didn’t often died trying. Outside of the Raza, only Murphy’s zone had a steady water supply. The infirmary had a large tank in the absement where the boilers were. It wasn’t much – only 30 days’ worth – but Murphy was calmer. It also meant I still had time. ‘Thank God for basements full of -’ my mind stopped, like a lightbulb exploding; basements! ¡Pinche sotano!’
Rafa rolled into the housing unit, “Eli! Ey guay, Eli!” Heads turned as they stared at this ghost on wheels. Bodies parted until Rafa came face to face with Julio. Julio blinked, blinked again. “Rafa? I, I thought they killed you too…” ‘Killed me too? Who’s dead? Who killed who?’ ran Rafa’s jumbled thoughts."

Rus and I were usually assigned to the kitchen garden. We took care of weeding and cleaning the rows each day. During harvest, we had two identical small stools we perched on while picking peas, tomatoes, or strawberries and scooting up and down each row. Our voices chattered like magpies while we practiced our required scripture recitation or multiplication tables. We also sang a lot. The cult had set all the Psalms to music which is why we had that entire book memorized. We would do call and response as we worked along with plenty of giggling.
When I was seventeen, I left the cult. My mother’s parents had enough and pretty much paid a bribe to release me. I left everyone whom I had been close to or known. It was wrenching. I lost contact with Ellie and Rus, even though they also left the cult.
When I committed my crime, I was forced to stay at the jail. That turned out to be for three years. My mother rented a house and moved to that city to be close to me. While mom was out shopping one day, she ran into Ellie of all people. Unbeknownst to each of us, we had been living in the same city. After that, every week, Ellie came to see me in jail. Ellie posted on all of my details on Facebook which alerted Rus to what had happened to me. Rus started flying in to see me when she was in the States.
I have been in prison for a significant amount of time. Ellie lives in Denver and Rus is an Art Conservator in the Emirates, but my two sisters faithfully come and see me in Miami once a year. I can always count on a visit in the Summer and Winter from each of my sisters."

No girls were attracted to it, but it did grow stronger. Even while my schizophrenic mind worsened, my body improved.
But when I was 17, it took another turn when I, like an idiot, thought I could be Goku. I consumed a monstrous amount of caffeine and damaged my heart. In the freezing cold I did this, wearing ankle weights and a heavy weight vest, trying to be like a fictional character convinced that psychokinesis and blasts and powers of all sorts were real. My body suffered from the psychosis of my mind. That was Christmas 2010. I nearly died. But my body persisted.
I then sought to destroy my pestiferous body, suicidal. Oh, my body gained its strength back and then some. It reached the muscular weight of 213 pounds. It was strong. Oh, but the body must follow the mind.
On April 3rd, 2012, I committed murder in an asanine attempt to obtain a gun, which would place a bullet in my skull. Why go through all the trouble? Why not just cut my wrists? Surely you ask these things. The body must follow the mind. The mind did not want the eyes to watch the wrist bleed out or feel the slow fade of pills. The mind wanted the body to slip into eternal sleep quite quickly. So the body had to follow. Yet the poorly planned plot failed. And my body kept going.
Even now, it will not quit. The kidneys of this body are failing. The heart has stopped three times. The circulation is poor. The stomach is...off. Not bad, just off. The skin is weakening. The forehead is acne ridden. The spine is deteriorating slightly. The hands shake when any drop of adrenaline is released. And the mind wishes that the body would just give up and give out. Yet my body will not quit, even under the pain. Even under the sleeplessness. God must have a plan for my body. My mind only hopes He will get on with it.

It mattered not that I had no record, volunteered for five charities, was a successful filmmaker, or that I would never intentionally hurt anybody. I had expressed profound remorse, taken responsibility, and made restitution; all the things people don’t expect us to do but things I did because they came naturally to me as the right things to do. But for this I was accused of trying to “buy my way out of prison.” Sister Dunn told the judge the only thing that got her through her days was her church and the prayers of her pastor and all the good people of the congregation. Honestly, this confession blew me away. I certainly realized she was in a great deal of pain, but she wasn’t suffering alone.
With all due respect, I ask how we can stand on the bedrock of the church and claim Christ as the Cornerstone of our lives and simultaneously crack the whip that splits the skin of our transgressors? So we revere the adage “practice what you preach?”
I know personally from experience that losing a loved one is not easy and instinctively we want somebody to pay for the pain we feel when we hurt, especially in what seems a senseless death. But what Sister Dunn did not understand is that I, along with my family and friends, were grieving her brother, and praying for her, too. I was crushed by the tragedy, and I’ve never recovered. We are human and we make mistakes, albeit some greater than others with devastating consequences, but to forgive is to open God’s grace as the antidote to what ails us.
The Garden of Eden may have been tainted by sin, but we still grow, humankind, side by side in this world, like flora. There are keys to our survival such as kindness, like the warmth of the glorious sun and the ability to withstand the strong winds of change and trial. Sometimes deluged in rain or soaked in sadness, our spirits plunge or are invaded by pests we feel may devour our soul, but these elements test us and strengthen us like a new bud, so that ultimately, we can rise above and blossom unique and beautiful. Whether delicate or thorny we are worthy of redemption, mercy, and grace.
It’s been years now and still I hope that one evening at mail call a letter may arrive from Sister Dunn saying that she has forgiven me. I know that forgiveness is for her heart to heal, not my own. In forgiving, love can enter and heal even the deepest wounds.
I love this quote by Mark Twain: “Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it.” By practicing forgiveness, perhaps like a bee with the flowers nectar, we can spread the sweet perfume of love and compassion. It is a profound gift we can encourage and circulate."

The only matter that’s deterring me is my health and medical bills. If I stay here and get the medical treatment that I need, then all my bills will be paid by the state; if I leave and go home, then I will have to pay all of the medical bills myself. I am a diabetic and insulin dependent. I have high blood pressure and HEP-C. I am in such a pitiful state. Doctor Jon Seley told me that I needed three stents placed in my heart cavity, but there has been a delay due to my uncontrolled blood pressure and high blood sugar, which I must first manage before the heart operation can proceed. I want to get it done but I am flying high emotionally to get out of this place. At this present moment, I am growing more and more impatient with each passing day.

She was looking out at Vegas in all its glory as bright as the throne room of God, and that caused her nerves to jump and her blood to rush.
Then she thought of what Raphael might be doing at the moment. She didn’t know if he was still in county jail or prison. After she received the news of his massive sentence, she believed he never would get out from under those dead yellow lights.
“Raphael,” she whispered as a tear rolled off her eye. She remembered the last time she was with him.
“I have to go to work,” Raphael pleaded with her.
“No, take a nap with me first,” she cooed at him.
“No, baby, I have to go,” he answered.
“Baby, no! Take a nap with me.” She pouted and made her face because she knew he would fall for it. Raphael stood next to the front door of their one-bedroom apartment in his worn-out boots, old jeans, and muscle shirt that hung loosely off his shoulders because he had stopped working out once they had moved in together. When they were together, they remained in each other’s arms. There was no reason to do anything else.
“Alright, a quick nap, then I have to go,” he said as he gave in.
“Carry me,” she pleaded, and she stuck her arms out. He scooped her off the couch and she wrapped her arms around his neck. He carried her into the bedroom and laid her down on the bed.
“Happy now?” he asked sarcastically. She just nodded and grinned.
“Oh, you think that’s funny?” he said as he feigned anger and began to caress her with his tongue. She giggled and hugged him. The last thing she saw before she fell asleep was his brown eyes and messed up hair. The first thing she heard when she awoke to a bang on the door was, “Open up, POLICE DEPARTMENT!”

“Yes ma’am, just peachy, just a nervous flier.”
She shuffles off to help someone secure their seatbelt – leaving me to the cold sweat puddle accumulating in my shoes.
I close my eyes and pray for sleep – it defies me. Colors meld. Sounds become emotions. I feel myself letting go, feeling weightless. BUT I’m not relaxed, quite the contrary. I’m stressed, anxious, and terrified – every nerve in my body is screaming. Hours pass like this until we mercifully land at Dallas International.
I board a service bus to M.E.P.S. (Military Entrance Processing Station) for intake. After they confirm my I.D., they administer a blood and urine test.
“What’s this for?” I ask.
“Drugs.” The bored nurse answers without looking away from her files. Uh oh - I think.
The next day I’m on a plane again – not to the Middle East, but back to Miami. My time in the service is over. They call it, “Other Than Honorable” discharge. Not quite as bad as Dishonorable, but definitely not as good as Honorable. I’m upset at myself, at Kara, at the Army. A part of me wanted to see what I was made of, wanted to have those stories. I saw my team; Lucero, Peltier, and Anderson before I left Dallas – I thought I saw a hint of anger in their eyes.
I don’t talk to Kara anymore – I move out the next semester. She was a bad influence. I write to the guys and send them care packages. They’re due back in a couple months. They have great stories, I’m sure, and I can’t wait to hear them.

The same principles drive everything in this world. If you pull a pendulum out one way, it will swing back just that far the other way. If you’ve been starving for days, and somebody puts food in front of you, you won’t be polite while you are eating. You will shove the food into your mouth like an animal. The degree to which you will act like an animal is the exact degree to which you were starving enough to bring up your animal instincts.
The middle is the place where there is no energy pushing in either direction. The pendulum has been permitted to come to balance concerning food, relationships, sex, money, doing, not doing, and everything else. Everything has its yin and yang. The middle is the place in which these forces balance quietly. Indeed, unless you go out of the middle, things tend to stay in peaceful harmony. If you want to understand the middle, you must take a closer look at what lies between the two extremes. This is because neither extreme can last. How long can a pendulum stay at one of its outermost positions? It can only remain there for a moment."

She did not have a license yet. Don’t tell her I told you that.
Back at home in our tiny studio apartment, all of your stuff was just sitting in a corner waiting for you to show up and claim it. There was a brand sparkling new dresser and crib. The crib was complete with a Winnie the Pooh bed set and a Musical Eeyore mobile hanging from the headboard. Your dresser was full of onesies and blankies and the top was covered with diapers, wipes, bottles, powders, creams, and I don’t know the rest. There was even some sort of a milking machine for your mom and a two-way radio device called a “baby monitor”. What the hell were you going to do with that?
The apartment was so small I could stand in one corner, spit, and hit all three of the other corners. Your mom HATED it when I did that. I’ll tell you kiddo, you sure do know how to build suspense. I was losing my patience. I was about to burst with love for you and I wanted you around so I could show everyone how proud of you I was.
I took your mom up to “Pikes Peak”. We walked around all afternoon at 14,000 feet above sea level. You weren’t there. I took a picture of your mom asking a Bighorn ram for directions. He claimed he hadn’t seen you either.
Back to town. Defeated again. Back to the flea market the next day. Only this time I went to work. I took your mom with me because, well because she said I had to. I parked the van in the 15’ x 15’ space. Unloaded and set up the “E-Z-Up” tent, arranged the tables in a horseshoe shape and then began loading them up with collectible toys and action figures, boxes and boxes full of comic books and non-sport trading cards. Once that was completed, I opened the side door of the van, spread out some comforters and pillows to make your mom comfortable. That was my primary job for a few years, making your mom comfortable.
Then I went to a concession stand to get our breakfast. For your mom, I got two corndogs, a turkey leg, a basket of deep-fried dill pickle slices, and a chocolate-covered bacon strip on a stick. I got myself a breakfast taco and a beer. After I got your mom settled with her “snacks”, I turned to the aisle and found it milling with hundreds of potential victims. I mean customers. But before I could sell a single comic book, I heard a loud “sploosh” behind me. It sounded like someone had thrown a large water balloon against the side of the van. I turned to check on your mom and I guess she recognized the look on my face as quizzical.
She said, “my water just broke!”
WHAT? Her water broke? How do you break your water? She had gotten really good at breaking wind but now she’s talking about breaking water. Is that even possible? I checked my beer to make sure she hadn’t broken it too.
She noticed the look on my face hadn’t changed so she said, “the baby is coming, you idiot!” Your mom can say idiot with more affection than anyone I know.
What baby? I asked.
“Your daughter is coming!”
I looked up and down the aisle hoping to catch a glimpse of you. No luck. Your mom scootched to the edge of the back door, plopped out of the van, and calmly waddled to the nearest payphone (payphones are what we used before God gave us cellphones…).
As the situation began to dawn on me, I started grabbing and throwing things into the van regardless of the value or condition of packaging. I was tossing toys like crazy: Star Wars, Star Trek, G. I. Joe, X-men action figures, Cabbage Patch Kids and Barbie dolls. Boxes and boxes of mint and near mint comic books. Trading cards from “Garbage Pail Kids” to “Magic the Gathering” and “Marvel Universe”. All tossed into one pile in the middle of the van. Right, where your mom had been sitting when she broke her water.
This little fact would not occur to me for several hours. However, I was beginning to realize what had probably dawned on your mom twenty minutes earlier… Surrounded as we were, in one of the largest weekly flea markets in North America, by vendors and pedestrians it would be hours before our van went anywhere.
The dispatcher at the cab company refused to send her a car. He told her to call 911 and get an ambulance.
Taking her turkey leg and deep-fried pickle slices, she left me to finish packing and wait until the crowd thinned out enough to move the van. I met your mom at the hospital but you still hadn’t shown up. I guess you just weren’t in a hurry to get here… When you finally did show up, OH MY GOODNESS! You were the most beautiful creature in all of God’s creation! Just look at those tiny wrinkled feet! No wonder it took you so long to get here. I love you so much!"

It’s an infinite journey based upon going beyond yourself every minute of every day for the rest of your life. If you’re truly going beyond, you are always at your limits. You’re never back in the comfort zone. A spiritual being feels as though they are always against that edge, and they are constantly being pushed through it."

A sadness clouding the gentle, loving features of her heart. Disappointment in her eyes! Reading thoughts never spoken. Why do you steal money from me, my grandson? Have I ever denied your asking? Flashing to the image of her name on a stone, that I have only seen pictures of.
Emerging from the fog, legions of professionals, all of the same feature. The same thoughts unrelentingly bombarding my mind. You could have been me, or me, or me, or any and all of us. Choices you had. Choices you knowingly and intentionally ran from. Where did that get you?
Reality there, all around emerging from the fog scenes of violence, scenes of depravity, committed and felt. There were moments of despair. Moments of hope. Moments of good happy times. There, times of perpetual loneliness. Times to be proud of, and times to mourn. Times to regret. There, hardships and constant adversity. There, questions of uncertainty, mental stability, depression and insanity.
No! No! I have stood and faced all that you have tormented me with. No, I am not ready to face that. Emerging from the fog, the death of the mother not yet come, but not far off. The look of searing pain in her eyes, and the words silently spoken, that only the heart can hear. Where are you my son? Why are you not here as the light fades from my eyes? Why did you have to go away? Why couldn’t you stay out of trouble, so you could come back home? Why my son? Was not all the love you were given enough to pull you away from that ill-fated life? Why my son?
I cannot tear myself away from this vision emerging from this nightmare of a fog. It holds my body and soul captive, as the last shreds of my heart, my humanity, are torn from my chest, leaving nothing but an inviting hollowness, waiting to waiting to be consumed by all the hate and malice this life I chose to exist in breeds. My own subconscious screams I hear, reverberating back upon me as if from celestial blows of a mighty hammer.
Emerging from the fog, a reality that cannot be denied. Hard as we each think we are, we all have that which weighs heavily on us, that which torments us. At some point over a life sentence, you will reach the end of your endurance, and will have to acknowledge, accept, and face your own demons. I have faced my tormentor time and time again. It has broken me down, and rebuilt me all the stronger, just so it can torment me anew.
My tormentor is upon me now! Emerging from the fog!"

I just simply understood that, I was to walk the line beside my people, especially the crips.
So, racial equality is possible and it isn’t. It all depends on the situation I believe.
I was born in Stockton, California, a city that populates many nationalities and my friends were of all races. My mother and father never taught me to dislike other races. They taught me to never ever dislike my own race. And with my father being a Black Guerrilla Family member, I was taught that black was power! And that black was beautiful like my mother.
On television, I see shows on CBS, like Big Brother and the show Survivor displaying racial inequality and I believe it’s unintentional.
For example, there’s always just a couple color folks, whether black, Asian, Cuban, etc., and the minute one of those minorities speaks out of line, it places a bullseye on their back immediately!
Watch them shows and seasons and latest ones and the pattern is there. I’ve been watching them shows on CBS for almost a decade now!
Now, like I stated earlier, I don’t believe it’s intentional. I truly don’t. It’s just a normal reaction on those contestants’ minds, due to identity.
I’ve seen a few minorities try to build alliances, it never worked out due to them being minorities...inside the game. The odds have been to great to overcome in the Big Brother’s house and on Survivor.
Is racial equality possible? No and yes!
On elast example. Ben Carson made some wicked comments during his run. Donald J. Trump also made and still makes wicked comments and see the outcome?"

The temperature is closely monitored because the spore is “sown” as the heat of decomposition declines (I recall it being around 125 degrees). Once the mushrooms are harvested this organic compost is no longer usable commercially, but makes for a nutrient rich fertilizer for the home garden.
For local gardeners the operator of this “farm” made the discarded compost available at either $1.00 per cubic yard if they loaded your dump trunk or free to those loading their pickup truck or U-Haul type trailer themselves.
Although the roughly 1,000 square foot area that I set aside for my vegetable garden was already a rich, black, humus, I transported enough of the mushroom compost with my pickup truck to provide a six inch thick coating in the garden which was then tilled into the soil.
My fellow garden club members sang the praises of the mushroom compost as fertilizer, but did not warn me about how it would effect plant size and harvest production. I learned about this aspect all too rapidly.
I was accustomed to Mom’s tomato plants being about 3 feet tall and 18-20 inches in diameter producing fruit adequate to supply the family’s needs during harvest season. Since my garden area was ten times that of mom’s, I figured that I could plant seven each of Heinz-57, beefsteak, and roma tomato varieties to have enough “excess” crop to do some canning of various tomato products.
I did the same thing with bell peppers, green beans, radishes, beets, and a few other personal favorites. I also experimented with sweet corn interplanted with a pumpkin variety specifically hybridized for pies. Strawberries were also a new crop for me, but I figured “what the heck” since I had the space and barefoot plants from the nursery I dealt with were surprisingly cheap.
My Heinz and Beefsteak varieties had to be staked with 8 foot 2 x 4s because they were between 5 and 6 feet tall and 3-4 feet in diameter. Production was well over 400 pounds of ripe tomatoes and another 50-75 pounds of green tomatoes still on the vine when the first frost hit. I spent many days in the kitchen canning every imaginable variety of tomato product. Then there were the cucumbers for pickles, green beans, corn, beets, and can’t forget the strawberries consuming more evenings and weekends in the kitchens. I was in gourmet heaven! As it turned out, the frozen and home canned garden produce were enough to last me and my then wife until the following year’s harvest.
So, as you can see, for me manure is marvellous once you make it into fertilizer."

Turner-of-Many-Stones heard the loud honking and thrashing one afternoon around the pond. Creeping low and quiet, he saw the poor goose, its leg clamped by those awful steel jaws, the jaws chained to the stake buried into the root-tangled earth beside a tree. He’d seen the trap before, as a cub - his sister, Bird-Chaser, had been caught, the trapper coming along to kill her before she could chew her way free. He saw his sisters fur and tail on the man’s feet later.
So when the same man-thing came crashing through the brush, Turner couldn’t watch it happen again - he leapt out, barking and biting. Somehow, the man was driven off, leaving behind only bloody drops and a piece of its paw. Turner went to the goose, worn down from her prolonged efforts to fly away.
“I can free you, goose-sister, but it will hurt, and you will lose your paw.”
“Stay back, fox! I will peck you blind! I will not be your easy meal!” the exhausted Hinda squawked.
“I will not eat you.” Turner insisted. “‘Please - I would not wish to see your feathers decorate the man-thing. Let me help.”
In the end, Hinida’s pecking was too feeble to be much harm to Turner, and he managed to bite through her leg quickly. The goose passed out from the pain, so Turner guarded her from his own kin until she awoke. Even then, she resisted trusting him, but she could not deny that he’d kept his word, and her wounded wing (broken by her earlier struggles) forced her to accept his aid in the coming weeks, when the snow drove her kin south.
~~
The woman was cleaning up dinner when she saw the strange couple approach her door; a toy baby carriage with a goose in it pushed by a small fox. The goose fluttered out clumsily, landed badly - the fox dragged a sack from the back of the wicker carriage, which clunked like a bottle as it hit the packed-dirt drive. Catherine went to the door.
“Broken wing?” she asked the startled pair.
Nervously, the fox came forward, dropped the sack at her feet. “Yes, great witch. And her leg.”
Catherine checked closer, the goose shyly balancing on one foot. “Mm. Let me guess - one of Donald’s stinking traps again?”
“I do not know the main-thing by name, Mistress LaFleur. If you say it is this Don Auld, it must be so,” Turner agreed. “But yes, a trap, the steel teeth.”
Catherine nodded, muttered under her breath - “Fool man. Trapping, in this day and age, like a Davey Crocket fanboy.” - and reached down for the sack, peered in. “Ah! My favorite: rum and cola.” The witch nodded. “But, fox… the leg?” A meaningful look, questioning.
“I know, Mistress.” Turner replied. “Will it work?”
“Will what work, Turner?” Hinda asked, frightened. “You said she could fix the wing. What’s this about my leg? You - “
“Now, now, Hinda” cut in Turner. “Just let me bargain with Mistress LaFleur, will you? It’ll all be fine.” He looked again to the witch. “Will it?” he asked again.
“Maybe.” the woman nodded slowly.
“And must I bring more?” Turner pressed.
“Tell me, ‘Turner’,” the witch demanded. “Was it you who took Donald’s finger?” She waggled her right hand before her.
“The trap man? I took a piece of his paw, yes,” Turner admitted.
“For me!” Hinda honked. “He saved me! If you won’t help, don’t punish poor Turner for his kindness, great witch.”
The woman chuckled, turned to go inside. “Punish him Ha! Consider the work paid in full, my little friends. Come in, then - we have work to do.”
~~
Hinda swooped in a great circle, then awkwardly settled down beside Turner, honking in joy. “Oh , Turner! Thank you so much for my wing. I just… the leg… it’s -”
“Bah, my love, hush.” Turner interrupted. He walk-skipped to nestle into her neck and curl his bushy tail around her replacement leg, black like his left paw had been. “It’s a wedding present, I said - no way you can refuse now anyway. Besides,” he went on “I had four to your one. What could I do but try to make it fair, eh?”
Hinda sighed, held back a sob, resigned herself. “Yes, okay, as you like, darling.” She ruffled her feathers, like shedding water. “Alright then… about the wedding, hm?”
Turned looked fondly at his beloved. “Yes… will you still have me, my love?”
“Of course, you furry little fool.” Looking thoughtfully at the trail heading out of town. “Walk me home, Turner-of-Many-Stones?” He saw a smile in her eyes.
“Well, if you don’t mind me skipping a bit,” the fox grinned back. “Bless the witch, eh?”
“Oh, yes, darling - bless her indeed.”

It takes strength to continue to be someone who’s willing to help others and respect their human dignity even when they’re so unlikely to merely say “thanks.” The system’s inhumanity only thrives because so many choose to excuse its inhumanity: “He/she/it/they deserve it.”
I choose otherwise, and suspect that I can’t help it.
I wish I could’ve ignored my mom’s plight!
But I wouldn’t have been able to look at myself in the mirror.
A lot of people look at themselves in the mirror, shave, and manage to not cut their own throats in disgust… and the system is what it is.
Anyway, I don’t need a reward for trying to be decent (many times I’ve failed; blood I have spilt…), so I know that the same is true for others of you who similarly strive. Nevertheless, I thank Greg, for creating this should-be-award-winning forum; Dillon James Gresham, for the greatest compliment my art could have; James Bauhaus, for his critical wit forcing me to sharpen my own—“There can only be one highlander”; and Catherine LaFleur, for keeping us boys charmed.
I get help too, from a young woman in France who runs my Facebook and Instagram pages, from a Catholic priest who knows I’m an atheist (with horns tattooed on my head) and a Jewish neuroscientist who knows I have a swastika tattoo that I’ve grown out of. These three amigos can’t help but help too.
So, brother, and more-so sisters, if ya see me and need a dime. “Get yo’ hand in my pocket!”—it’s just a dime."

Now the fish king has been overthrown by his estranged lost cousin, The Prince of Eels. Under his dictatorship, the only fish who are not net bondage are the whales and dolphins because they claimed their sovereignty decades ago and formed the United Republica of Blow Holes.
The Prince of Eels army isn’t bold enough to wage war. The king of fish has promised everlasting life to any one who is brave enough to revolt against his cousin.
Now yoshi and myself swim through the lake. I notice that there’s a militia of sea horses equipped with automatic harpoons. Now I’m understanding the severity of the ruleship. The prince of eels shows no mercy upon those we dare to defy his laws and governance. As we get closer to the coral reef structured mansion, the tempo of the water changes. Before the water was roughly body temperature warm. Now it is at least 30 degrees hotter. I’m not sure of it, however, I’m positive that I’m sweating. Not only am I sweating, I am actually feeling my lungs being weighed with a profound amount of pressure. As I try to breathe, I feel the air get sucked out of me.
Then yoshi turns towards me and says, “Clear.” I feel my body spasm. Now there’s a tingling within my entire body. My adrenaline glands are activated, it’s now or never. “Clear.”"

The time you surprised me hiding in the back of my Toyota and blared Trent Reznor from the speakers. The way you wore my “Destination Unknown” shirt with your locker key in a band around your bronzed ankle when we were at the water park. The trance music tape I still have which your DJ friend made you. The way our lips met on the loveseat in the most passionate, memorable kiss of my life, then and ever since. The glimmer in your bright blue eyes when you told me my name “fit” me because I really was “beloved.” I should’ve told you at that moment that I loved you more than life itself and that your name “fit” you because “beautiful” characterized not only your exceptional good looks but also your mind, heart, and soul. I should’ve told you I would’ve spent the next 20 years at your side instead of painfully missing you, feeling lost without you.
I laid my head against the steering wheel and wondered where you were at that moment and what you were doing. Tears formed in the corners of my eyes. I longed for us to be together like we were that January day under the soft blankets as our skin touched and we glanced shyly at each other. We both broke into simultaneous smiles: there was magic only two could feel, and we knew we had something special.
You trusted me, but I repaid you by abandoning you. I didn’t want to accept what we had because I lacked the self-assurance. I didn’t love myself at the time, and so how could I have loved you? Though I said the words, it would’ve taken a confident and mature man to love you the way you deserved to be loved: I was neither. Any child could’ve told me that I wasn’t ready for a relationship.
I got out of the car and held the golden eagle from my necklace which I wore in your honor toward the swarm of locusts. I hoped the golden eagle would meet the mythical dragon you sent up to your son as a token of your love. I prayed that the eagle would reawaken your love enough so that my face would cross your mind once again after a long period in which you probably tried to forget me.
I wanted you to remember that despite our problems, we felt something once and that I’m sorry for leaving you when you were most vulnerable.
I never made it to Florida, or any further than Ohio. I ended up in a cold place made of concrete and steel instead because love is about caring about another person’s, not your own, desires, goals, and aspirations. It’s not about words but action for another person, putting them before yourself. I failed at that due to my own selfishness. I thought we’d keep in touch, but life happens between those thoughts: I got a different job, you found someone else, seasons entered and ebbed, and time marched on.
I hope it’s not too late to find you one day and that this heartfelt message finds you. I still miss and love you. I still cry out for you on lonely nights. Can you ever forgive me?"

“Yes I do.”
“Well how did that happen? I mean, we both are clean and take showers before and after we make love.”
She wouldn’t answer me. Later on that night, I had my suspicious. I hacked her Blackberry while she was in the shower. She never cleaned her phone out like I did. She always said I was paranoid. I constantly deleted messages. She had 1,000 texts saved for the past month. I guess I hit the Jackpot. One of the messages said, “I love you.” It was her friend named Stephen. On closer inspection, the messages that said I love you were on Fridays and Saturdays when I’m out looking for work. “Son of the whore of Babylon. This bitch did not just play me.”
I still had nowhere to go, and so I had to figure out plan B. I kept doing housework, catering to her and giving her daily (yes daily) backrubs and foot massages. It took me a week to figure out where I was going to live, work, eat, and sleep. Under pressure with nothing to lose, I feel my instincts kick in. It’s survival time now. I’m a very good woodsman and survivalist, and I don’t get lost. I basically found a 2-acre vacant lot full of trees in a rich neighborhood, set up camp, and made my way to the beach where all the tourists are. I left before her, packed my shit, put it on the porch, and waited until she came home. “Where are you going?”
“Have fun with Stephen…”
Bargains 2 by Jeremy Brown
As far as bargains go, the best bargain I found was on Craigslist in 2010, before I was incarcerated. I had to paint this doctor’s house and in return I got 2 huge 50-inch flatscreen TVs. I wasn’t doing it alone. I brought my 2 brothers and sisters along and we had a wonderful time just painting and joking around. Well the Tv’s had a bulb missing in each of them or the bulb was burnt out so we just ordered 2 $8 bulbs. 6 months later both TVs broke and we got rid of them. They were old big and bulky flatscreens, each weighing about 100 pounds. I guess it was worth it. SOmetimes you’ve got to take a risk."

Snatching back my hand, rubbing the back of my head, I look up seeing dad with a smirk on his face standing behind me stretching forth his hand to me. Taking his hand we start after the rest of the family. We then separate into groups heading out on the city dweller’s safari.
The first place my group views is a huge man-made cirque at the center of the main thoroughfare. Inside is a center area filled with intricate jungle-gym intermingled with dirt mounds, vegetation and rock formations; a wide moat-like trench around it; and then a steep concrete wall surrounding it all rising to the fence surrounding it all. We lean over the fence excitedly checking out the first chimpanzees we’ve ever seen. There's sixty-odd of them; male, female, babies. They’re involved in several different activities: feeding, grooming, playing, sitting looking at us watching them, begging food (there are signs all over informing us not to feed the animals except from designated vendor devices at each variation), and suddenly we see one peeing in the moat and another shitting in its hand then throwing it at a teasing watcher. This is the start of an educating day.
Hogle Zoo has a little train you can ride around on, as well as, an elephant with a blanket and basket-like seating contraption. They cost money and I’ve never rode either.
The penguin habitat has a sectioned off surface area with a large pond and coastal area. The penguins awkwardly and funnily waddle around and then drive into the pond and streak away. There’s a stairway down to an underwater viewing window where you can watch the fluidity of the little creatures. I want to dive in and play with them. But right next to the penguins is my favoritest habitat: the otters, seals and dolphins . If I could be any animal it would be one of these. No more can be said.
The bear habitats are a cool: the shy pandas, the black and browns, grizzlies, and polar bears. One time the female polar bear had two cubs. Very interesting and funny! The boisterous cubs crawled over, bite ears and generally pestered mom, and each other, the whole time and their mom just lay there passively. I was jealous!
I love the cat-house. Here you find the lions, cheetahs, jaguars, cougars, leopards, etc., etc,...and tigers. Fear inspiring! Hogle Zoo used to have a unique creature–a Liger. Never heard of a liger? It’s a very rare cross between a lion and tiger. Seriously! I’m not sure if another one is out there somewhere but it’s a real creature. She had kinda whitish and black stripes and was really big. Mostly tigerish featured. I think its name was sheera or shasta or something. She Was really beautiful. Look it up. It’ll be worth it.
The aviary is wonderfully loud with many species. It holds a small finch and hummingbirds to large eagles and vultures to the nocturnal owls–hundreds of birds flying around in an artificial-natural habitat. One flying creature I didn’t expect to find here, but I did, is the Honeybee. There’s a large glass apiary where you watch the bees inside workings of the bees in action.
Another of my favorite habitats is for rodents: ground-squirrels,woodchucks, mice, prairie-dogs, etc… This is fun because part of the exhibit is a large “prairie-dog village” that humans can crawl around in “tunnels” leading to different “surface holes” and stick your head out like a prairie-dog.
An interesting story about the gorilla exhibit. At one time a female (I think) kinda adopted a domestic kitten. It goes that a kitten shows-up in the gorillas habitat one day when the keepers tried to remove it, the gorilla wouldn’t let them. The last I heard it was still there.
There’ve habitats for llamas, deer (all kinds), wolves, giraffes, hippos, rhinos, elephants, reptiles, insects, snakes (do not tap the glass! I always tap), aquatic creatures, zebras, wildebeests, lemurs, lemmings, ant-eaters, etc…, and many more I’ve forgotten. It’s been over 20 years and I can’t wait to go again.
Lastly, when we leave the first time I went, as we trudge out of the main gate my dad and I stop at the wishing-fountain, each throwing in a quarter–wishing for a quick return. This is what the fountains for him told me. The funniest thing that day: As we walk to the car a big grayish-whitish blob of bird shit splats square onto my head and drips down my forehead. Dad laughs so hard he’s crying. Never seen anything like that from him before that day or since. I didn’t think it was so funny. But I’d take it anew if I could be at the zoo again."

The part of you inside that’s not okay with itself can’t face the natural unfolding of life because it’s not under your control. If life unfolds in a way that stimulates your inner problems, then by definition, it’s not okay. It’s really very simple: that which doesn’t disturb you is okay, and that which does is not. We define the entire scope of out outer experience based upon our inner problems. If you want to grow spiritually, you have to change that. If you are defining creation based upon the most messed up part of your being, what do you expect creation to look like? It’s going to look like a frightful mess."

Turn on the TV any time of day and you will hear our president weaving a web of lies more intricate and deadly than any spider. One day we’ve beaten ISIS, the next day they are almost under control. He declares on the campaign trail, in front of live TV cameras and thousands of supporters, that he had no ongoing deal with Russia, then months later he declares his deals with Russia did not affect his decision. Every week brings out another string of lies that his supporters accept as gospels and his detractors cite as evidence wide gap in public opinion where truth and facts are on the line? With the court of the Drama Queen? Believe it or not, that is where we are at this point of history. As for me, I will hold to my values and side with the power of TRUTH.
On the other hand, I can start charging an hourly fee to listen to these stories with a double indemnity fee if the story doesn’t pan out in 90 days or evidence proves the story is not true. I’m willing to bet that at this rate I could afford to hire my own lobbyist to secure legislation terminating the minimum maximum sentencing laws.
If you want to impress me, hold my attention or gain my approval, tell me a short, fact-filled account of some event in your life. Chances are that experience was one that I have never had nor ever heard about, and you will grab my attention. I’ll be anxious to listen to you and learn something from you.
If you’d stop rewarding the storytellers by listening to them and wasting your precious time you would find they’d eventually get the hint and perhaps develop a more productive form of communicating and learn to speak truthfully. Can you imagine living without having to duck and dodge the BS’ers, being able to listen with appreciation to a story with veracity and come away with your life enriched? Just set your expectations of communications with others a little higher and this will become your reality.

Short and sweet, and down to the point, he thought not good. As he went to the apartment on the 4th floor, which was small two bedroom with nice leather sofa and chairs. As he pulled his suitcase out from under his bed which was under a Keypad, he punched in the code so the floor would not blow up in a minute. He plugged his cell phone into his laptop as he opened the suitcase, and took out his old gear of knives and guns. He opened the email and the file attached to it, he sent a reply back hoping they would read it saying to call back with proof of his brother still alive. Then he set up a trace file within the email to find out who, and where they are.
As he studied the information on the building and the blueprints that he’d backed into the US files.
He’d hoped that he would not have to do this mission, not only was he retired, but the building was almost untouchable. Once he’d given up on them contacting him again, they sent a text message with a picture attached to it, showing his brother naked and hanging from a rope. The text said “try to trace us again and your brother dies!” He felt stupid, but now he was beyond pissed off.
He picked up his pistol and one long-range rifle with 50 cal ammo and went to work. Instead of making a bulletproof plan which he did not have time for, he went on instinct and drove a few blocks from the building. Two US soldiers stood out by the entrance fully ready for combat, only they were really not. As he walked by he’d pulled out his 40 cal pistol with a silencer, and shot both of them in the hand before they could even lift up their rifles. Once everyone stopped yelling and crying for help he was already 4 blocks down setting up his 50 cal, he knew or hoped once they seen the attack they would wait a while clearly it out and move the target to a new safe spot. Which he would then take along rung shot from 4 blocks away not too far, not too close. Plus at this rung bulletproof windows would not hold up to a 50 cal shot. Two shots, one the window, two the target. As it played out two shots went down line planned, and a clean getaway took place. Only a naked dead Omor was found dead in their apartment, Omec plots revenge as he holds his dead brother in all black..."

I became Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. One big box for my shoulders to fit through and one box for the head with eye slits, mouth opening, and a red ball clown nose, and a white string collar to hold my tin can bell. My father spray-painted the boxes brown and the eyes black. I wore a brown short sleeve shirt, brown slacks, brown socks, and brown shoes. It was a hot costume to be standing still in because once the heat in the gym where the parade took place turned on, there were few ventilation fans running to circulate air. My antlers were cardboard with hanger wire to keep them from flopping over when on the move.
As a tall gangly kid, lacking motor coordination and being a klutz made me an excellent choice to take my shot at playing Frankenstein’s creation of a pieced-together human male. So in 1971, my third grade year, my costume came from our local Salvation Army Thrift store. The ensemble included: a man’s dark colored suit jacket, a man’s long sleeve shirt, work pants, belt, and lace-up boots. To add effect, my mother randomly ripped and tore patches in the jacket and added fake blood and spider webbing. There were small holes and stains in the pants already, so none needed to be added. A front green facemask added the finishing touches. I had to wear two pairs of tube socks on each foot to keep from slipping out of the oversized boots. I practiced for several days how to do stiff walking gait with my complete costume. During the parade walk, I added sound effects: moaning, groaning, and grunting.
My mother was a bargain shopper, so when Halloween supplies went on sale on November 1st, 1971, she found me one old male front mask and one grey wig. I had grown up so much during my fourth-grade year in 1972 that I was able to wear my Father’s work pants, a gardening long sleeve shirt and his oldest pair of work boots. We added brown cotton gloves, a red neck handkerchief bandana, and my own belt. To create a hobo knapsack, we used a tree limb stick and an old torn sheet. For stuffing, I used wadded up newspaper pages. I learned to walk weaving style like I had had too much to drink.
How many of you remember the scare in the 1970s of railroad hobos and tramps coming into neighborhoods to steal, vandalize, and beg for handouts? During 1972’s, trick-or-treating evening hours, there was a radio public announcement cautioning consumers to be cautious whom you open the door for as local police were searching for several vandals that were known as train hoppers. I remember having to pull up my facemask to show myself and point out at the street to where my father was standing, or if we traveled by vehicle he would be by the front headlights driver’s side for easier visibility.
For my fifth grade costume in 1973, I borrowed my brother’s Sombrero that he won at a carnival. I wanted to be a Mexican Bandito. I wore jeans, a flannel shirt, mountain boots, and a handmade, checkered, multi-colored poncho. I was bright orange, dark blue, and black, and it had fringes at the ends. To disguise my face, I wore a pantyhose leg over my head and face, and then burrowed my hat.
As of 12/10/2012, I lost all my family. No one was willing to let me be out of the closet, proud to be gay and Pagan. I suffered from 12 to 50, forced to be a heterosexual male, including one failed marriage (no kids). I wrote them a farewell poem. I am all alone now."

Timber grew up to be a beautiful, if not miniscule, dog. People often wondered if she wasn’t still a pup. Katie was a diligent owner, walking her twice daily and changing her water as needed. They were inseparable the summer we got new neighbors with their own dogs.
These were the meaninst, nastiest, pair of pit bulls you’d ever seen. They looked like they’d spent a lifetime lifting weights in a prison gym-not an ounce of fat on them, always mean-mugging and tearing at their chain to get loose. Timber was weary of them too, always positioning herself between them and Katie on their daily walks.
Katie tore into the house, clearly terrified and out of breath. “They got loose, daddy” was all I could understand between sobs. I grabbed my baseball bat and ran out, fearing the worst.
I could hear Timber barking. My heart raced, she’s still alive! I can still save her, I thought. I saw the blood on the sidewalk before I saw the injured animal. It had a gash across its head from ear to neck and was whimpering loudly. Timber had cornered the other dog back into its own dog house and was clearly transformed. I barely recognized this beast. She looked twice as big-ferocious as any wild animal, with a low rumbling growl that dared the dog to move. As I approached she looked back at me and I swear to God she winked as if to say: runt indeed."

Why yes, it is a very fine morning lassie. Did you sleep well?” Red bounded over the clumpy grass then sat by the shore.
“How could anyone sleep with all that noise.” Lily fluffed her feather irritability, then back paddled just a smidge, he was a fox after all.
“Ahh lassie, you still do not trust me. I would never hurt you, you are simply more woman than I could ever handle.”
“But you would not shy away from snatching one of my eggs, now would you”
The Mallards paraded by again, this time at a safer distance from shore. Red licked his moist chops once more.
“Have I ever raided your nest?” Red licked his paws.
“Sam would have plucked your ears from your fur had you tried,” honked Lily, lowering her head in sorrow.
“I am so sorry Lilly, truly I am,” whined Red as he sniffed his way closer to the water’s edge.
Caution set aside, Lilly paddled to shore. She needed the comfort of a good friend. Something caught one of her webbed toes. Lily honked, panic sinking deep. She paddled hard for shore. It tangled her whole webbed foot. She kicked and honked, kicked and honked. It cinched tight and tighter, higher and higher up her legs. Lily could hear barking in the chaos of honks and quacks and frantic splashes, even a low throaty growl. Her flopping frantic head slapped against the water, then hit solid land. Her webbed feet were useless now so she dug her bill deep into the moist shore then pulled with all her might. Slinking like an inchworm, she pushed with her wings and pulled with her bill until she was out of the water.
Red was there, hovering her, eyes fixed and serious. He licked his chops. “Are you okay?” You look like a tangled mess.”
Lily gasped for air, bill agap. “My legs... my feet,” she hissed.
Fear settled in quickly, there were many other animals to fear on land. A myriad of monstrous critters raced through Lilly’s frantic mind. Then she saw the funniest thing. Red Fox pushing an old wicker baby carriage through the matted down grass.
“Can you use your wings?” asked Red Fox.
“How am I supposed to land without my feet,” honked Lilly swan.
Red shook his head, “Not to fly you silly goose, to help me get you into the carriage.”
Lilly did not like being called a goose, not one bit, but she was being silly, so she decided not to nip him. Red pushed the carriage as close to Lilly as he could.
“I’ll push,” informed Red, “You try to pull yourself abroad as best as you can.”
Lilly stretched her wings wide. “Hey” honed Lilly when a wet nose pushed her rump. It was a frantic scene, feathers flying, fur floating, a passerby may have seen it as a gruesome struggle. In the end, Lilly was nested in the wicker baby carriage. Red Fox had his paws atop the handles, body stretched thin and long, pushing the carriage down the road."

I’ve participated in street wars, and jailhouse “riots.” I’ve been shot and stabbed, yet, I survived.
And being incarcerated has given me a lot of time for “introspection.” I’ve sat inside my 6’ x 10’ cell and thought a lot about who I am, and what life is all about. What I’ve come to realize is that I had been living in total darkness. Unaware of my true self and my purpose in this life. I realized that all the trials and tribulations I’ve struggled through were designed to build me into the man I am to become. I have emerged from the fog into “conscious self-realization,” which is the process of knowing who you are, what your purpose and/or potentials are and striving to be that person every single day…
I’ve also come to realize that any problem can be solved. The problem must simply be identified and understood first. So with respect to mass incarceration, recidivism, black on black violence and other criminalistic behaviors that contribute to the epidemic of black genocide, which has a ripple effect that pervades every aspect of our society, we must realize and understand that these are only extensions of an underlying problem. Bigotry and racism.
But how could something so conspicuously ignorant be the cause of so much trouble? Because the whole world wants to believe in the fallacious notion of “equality,” which is nothing but an illusion. Because the actual state or condition of “equality” does not and cannot exist. It is simply a word that has been exploited for propaganda.
So, from my perspective, the way to supercede racism and prejudices associated with it is to wake up from the “American dream.” Because we are not all created “equal,” and we are not all endowed with inalienable rights. We are all born into this world special, precious and unique “individuals” with a chance to live and to learn (by living) how to manifest our individual destinies “harmoniously” with one another.
People choose to hate and participate in wars only because they don’t realize that there’s the option to love and to accept. And this is especially true for inner city youth who cling to gangs, drugs and violence as their only source of power. They do it because they don’t realize they have “options.” Because their mental and emotional development gets arrested (figuratively and literally) with illusions designed to distract them (us) from the truth. The truth of ourselves and how we fit in the world we live in.
But, just like waking up from a real dream (is that an oxymoron?) we realize we’re dreaming first. Then we try to control what’s happening in the dream. And then when things don’t go as we want them to go, we get up…"

I had only been out of prison for 3 years and was still struggling, but there I was with piles of cash being thrown at me. What would you do?
I finally sent a text for my girlfriend, Crystal, to meet me there. That probably wasn’t the best idea. Crystal, a petite blonde, showed up in her metallic blue, hard-top Corvette with the windows down, radio blaring, and bass booming. I heard her coming a mile away! She wasn’t exactly the ideal image of a “holy” girlfriend, walking over in her Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots.
When she got there, I was ankle deep in cash, putting my hands on people. What a sight that must have been! I would mumble something, and they’d either faint on claim of being healed. I was getting so good at the healing thing that I was beginning to believe it myself! The mind is such a powerful thing.
When the money flow stopped, Crystal whisked me away in her can with the promise that I would be back the next day. I was at war with my guilty conscience, but in the end, money won. We would definitely be going back the next day.
This went on for several weeks. I didn’t know where all the people came from, but as long as they were bringing money, I didn’t care. We had so much money that we didn’t know what to do with it. But it wasn’t enough. Is it ever enough? Greed will get you every time.
A man who called himself Rico approached me one evening. He said he was a reporter and was going to let the world know I was a fake then send me to jail. All of a sudden, he fell down to the ground in a slump in front of me. That’s when I saw Crystal with a large rock in her hands. I checked on the mand, and he was gone. There were screams behind me. I turned to see the crowd watching us: they were running away and screaming. I knew it was only a matter of time before I saw the blue lights and heard the siren of a police car.
Crystal said she was going to get the money and run to Costa Rica. She was yelling at me to hurry, but I was frozen as I heard her take off without me.
They say hindsight is 20/20, but what they don’t tell you is that it also makes you feel like an idiot. All I wanted was peace. Now, as you can see, I’m back in my special place trying to recapture my peace before they send me back to prison. Peace. Such a simple word, but so hard to find."

What normally took 3 months to grow then took 3 weeks to achieve the same growth.
Meteorologists were baffled at how the fallout cloud would cause their cities to go into early spring-summer climates. Lincoln news reports cautioned its citizens not to handle or try to catch the acid producing earthworms and caterpillars coming out of the meteorite egg like sack spores. Lincoln also had to educate its residents to wear dust facemasks whenever outdoors because their cloud also contained noxious fumes during the hottest part of the day.
Similarly, Wichita faced regular ants’ becoming giant fire ants and brown recluses becoming as large as six inch hairy tarantulas within a 30 mile radius or the meteorite landing site. The city also faced a 30% increase in pollination spores: mold, mildew and ragweed were at their highest of the past 9 years.
Moreover, Kansas City ran flash flood warnings within a 30 mile radius of its meteorite site landing. It rained everyday for the past 21 days, and schools used snowdays for closing due to both water damage and neighborhood flooding zones, making school unsafe to open.
Oklahoma City reported that its landing site was turned into a 9 mile marsh swampland with all mold spores hatching water moccasins rattlesnakes 9 inches long and 1.5 inches thick with the ability to spit spray if felt threatened. Many homeowners called herpetologist hotlines to seek help in excavating these hybrid snakes from their garages, storage sheds, ponds, pools, and livestock water tanks and feed bins. These snakes had red eyes and muddy brown and black marbling patterns on its back.
New strict guidelines had to be enforced by military personnel:

No citizen within a 30 mile meteorite landing site radius could travel outside its home zone of 15 miles.
No exporting any merchandise from any businesses within the 4 major cities until each load was cleared safe from Outbreak hazards.
No incoming tourism allowed by bus, car, plane or train to the landing site cities for 60 days. Effective March 1, 2016.

Arista, and the Krats, although they are able to cross the chasm created by her restive behavior, to get back to her family, choose not to do so, and her natural family is unable to surmount it. The Krats are isolated from every other family. They are sheltered, sheldid, and protected from the harsh realities of the world that they presume to govern. This is a very serious problem for all of society, because all of these Arista Krats are making decisions, establishing policy, and enacting laws that affect a world that they no longer understand. This family of Arista Krats is blind to this problem, but nearly every other family in the nation would testify to it. The saddest, and most dangerous thing about this situation is that the vast majority of these Arista Krats don't even understand that they don’t understand. Consider the following analogy: If a Boor, Granger, or Peasant conceived of, designed, and built an interstellar spacecraft - without enlisting the guidance of those who know about such things - would you be willing to undertake its maiden voyage? This sounds like a risky proposition; yet, this is exactly what these Arista Krats have done, only they are not the ones boarding their ill-conceived craft. They are, in fact, forcing us to board it. Do you see the sign? Road Out Ahead! Apparently they do not. Perhaps this explains why:

Spending on prisons consistently outpaces spending on education;
We send billions of dollars offshore to help the poor in a variety of third world countries, but neglect the poor in our own back yard;
We will spend tens of millions of dollars on a bridge to cross a wildlife preserve, but will not spend a dime building the infrastructure to support alternative prisons;
Prison is considered as the first - or only - option rather than the last resort, when judging transgressions of the law;
Vengeful draconian punishments are sought rather than measures designed to be corrective;
The disease (root cause/circumstance eliciting criminal behavior) is never addressed, but only the symptom (criminal behavior).

Isn’t it about time our sisters, the Arista Krasts of society, wised up? Shouldn’t we be telling them - Shouldn’t they already know - that incarcerating citizens by the hundreds of thousands, indeed, by the millions serves no useful purpose and is, in fact, a disservice to society on multiple fronts. Is it possible that all of our sisters were absent from school on the day they would have been taught about the psychology of human behavior and negative versus positive reinforcement? Perhaps we should take up the mantle of leadership here and ensure that our sisters, the Arista Krats, understand that negative reinforcement has only limited uses, beyond which it no longer functions as a deterrent to bad behavior, but its enabler. Negative reinforcement is useful only to get one’s attention. Once a person’s attention has been secured, positive reinforcement should be employed as the tool used to achieve positive behavior modification. This is the essential definition of rehabilitation.
Also, we should all understand that extremely harsh punishments (excessive prison terms), almost without fail, deny the transgressor any realistic opportunity of rehabilitation, and serve only to institutionalize the victims of such punishments? It is our sisterly duty, our responsibility, and our obligation, as the kith and kin of all the Arista Krats of society to let them know it’s time we lost our oppressivessive and vindictive nature and found our concerned, caring, and compassionate nature. Our world has evolved and changed since the days of Drace - 2600 years - it’s time our justice system caught up with the rest of it."

A couple of weeks later she feels sick. She doesn’t ever get sick. She finally goes to the doctor. The doctor runs some tests and congratulates her on being pregnant. She tells the doctor she does not know the name of the father or where he lives.
She’s very ashamed at getting pregnant in Mexico. She only tells a couple of people she got pregnant in Mexico. Her parents are definitely not on board. They basically disown her.
When her baby bump starts showing, she tells people she got pregnant at work. She says the father is one of the three married men that work in her department. That usually shuts down further inquiries. She is too embarrassed to admit her son was conceived by some unknown man at the MTV spring break party in Mexico.
When she goes into labor, her parents still don’t help her out. She almost gives birth in a cab. She gets to the hospital and they prep her to go to a delivery room. They didn’t make it to the delivery room. The baby pops out when they are wheeling her to the delivery room.
Her parents take about two years to warm up to their grandson. They are very religious. They were very embarrassed that their daughter conceived a child with an unknown man."

I heard someone else say, “Get the kid with the biscuit!” Confusion became chaos, and chaos became more confusion.
They never caught that kid with the biscuit, and they never caught me and my brother either until dad tried to use his clippers a few days later back in Beaumont. By then, it had been determined that the deed was justifiable and ultimately brought the best results.
Several years later, my dad retired from the Mobil Oil, and we moved to Texas and built a home in the woods of a small town called Silsbee, Texas. One day when my aunt came to visit us after Uncle Shug’s whiskey drinking days caught up to him, I couldn’t help but ask, “Hey you ever find out who shaved Shug?” She told me, “Yea, and it wasn’t the kid with the biscuit.” We both laughed."

As for as pants goes, you have 3 options--khaki uniform pants that don’t fit, gray sweatpants, or gray shorts. When deciding what shirt to wear, you have a few more options--a brown t-shirt, a khaki button-up shirt, a gray t-shirt, and a gray sweatshirt. When it comes to accessories, the options are even more limited. They sell one pair of earrings on commissary. That’s your only accessory--unless you buy something off of someone else, but that takes money I simply don’t have.
Prison has humbled me and brought me to my knees. I no longer have the need to fill my life with stuff. This is why my simple home is perfect for me.
Being separated from my children has put a hole in my heart that I can’t imagine ever being whole again. I went from never being away from my children to having no contact whatsoever--their father won’t allow it. Unless you’ve been in this some heart-wrenching situation, you can’t imagine the pain this brings. Words simply can’t describe it. THis is the reason I chose such a peaceful place to live. It hasn’t healed my heart, and maybe it never will, but my surroundings keep my spirit at peace-most days.
Being claustrophobic is not a good thing when you’re in prison. Have you ever heard of a “paddy wagon?” Let me describe it for you. Imagine the back of a normal-sized van. Split that in two and put in a metal cage. Imagine 5’9” claustrophobic me riding in that! Once I survived that, I was locked in a cell not much bigger than that--with 2 other people. That’s where I am locked down for 4 pm count and all night. This is why I need a place that is open. I have been closed in for too long. Did you notice that I took the front door off? That’s because I refuse to be locked in anymore.
What’s unusual about all of this? When you look at my name in the system, beside it reads, “escaped by death.” That’s what they call it when you die in prison before you are released. They’re right, I did escape because now I am free. Now my spirit lives on and I am at peace. Feel free to come and visit. You will never want to leave. I didn’t. But you’ll have to find your own special place to stay--this one is mine."

You are surely to see the rusting steel bars on the windows and hear the prisoners shout or even scream. Much sadness lingers in the cell halls like a thick fog that won’t go away.
1846 is when this land here in this town became a prison. Inmates would come and go like fog, but too few would emerge feeling any kind of love. Many would kill themselves and their souls escaped the walls, floating through the fog on their way to heaven.
Many before me would call this A-range the North cell block. Surely they’d have to shout out their inmate numbers, but for me they call me by my last name. But yet I sit here in this castle and wonder how many times an inmate would give up his life to be free with the fog or to be a free man to walk through the fog to be with their loved ones.
The state prison that I’m in shall be here for a very long time and for the next seven years of my life it’ll be home here behind castle walls. Inmates will come and go just as the fog does, but not freely."

Save for local commuter rail services like New York and Chicago’s subway system, San Francisco’s Bart, and Phoenix’s light rail, travel by train has all but been replaced by airlines.
Sadly, the relaxation and pleasures available with interstate and transcontinental excursions by train have been lost to our contemporary hurry-up, “I want it now” mentality. As a result, we routinely miss the benefits and beauty of what one country singer refers to as “the flyover states.”
In 1917 I had the opportunity to spend a summer month touring England, France, Switzerland, and Italy. Transcontinental travel in Europe was almost exclusively by train - and with the exception of Switzerland’s electric trains, coal burning steam locomotives were the predominant power source. Truly an experience I will not forget, but am unlikely to repeat anywhere in the world.
Rail beds are truly retreating into the misty fog of memory."

I asked her,
“Who told you to do that?” She replied it was Trixie.
Lucky that I was watching them and from that day on they played where one of us could see them all the time. The next day Scooter was in the kitchen and didn't know what he had done.

The more original, the better. With regards to that though, it’s not that hard for you to give some of your time. But know, this is also the best time to push, as she rubs on you. For it will make her want you more. Just blame it on her monthly cycle. Which should be around this time anyway. If not, blame it on the fact that she is far too along with the child.
We all want the best for our children. Even, and especially, when they are in the womb still forming. So understand, and teach her. The soul is born, at the highest level, twenty-nine days before conception. As a result, it is then born into three more realms, before coming into our world.
Now, know this. Whenever the sperm and egg congeal, the hard spark is there. This opens the well of souls. Then, the shekinah comes down to Earth. For this reason, you should never have an abortion. For even if you were raped, the Shamayin will make a way for the child. As it too deserves a chance at the tree of life.
You see, the heavens, called Shamayim in Hebrew are made up of two parts. Aish, which means free, and mayin which is water. The Frozen waters of space are filled with plankton. The fires of all stars are born from the congealing of the plankton. As their friction heats up, to create the initial burn. Have you ever touched dry ice?
But even the Shamayim needs something more to complete it. So, the man and woman join to give birth to sons and daughters. Then the daughters cling to her father while the son will cling to his mother. Thus, forming the x-factor. That is, in and of itself, a mirror of the divine. And that at the highest level, in fact.
In heaven, feminine is fire, masculine is water. On Earth, masculine is fire, feminine is water. Because we are the finality of the Shekinyah, the source of all feminine. And YHWH, the source of all masculine. But there is still much situated between us and them, which is why the Song of Shlomo was written. Even more so, why Shlomos’ Temple was built.
Our bodies and the pieces of the temple are one and the same. A woman’s vaginal walls are the outer pillars. The male penis is the priest. His sperm, the high priest. The Holy Place is the womb. And Holy of Holies, her ovaries. But the sacrifice must be made first. Just as when you make love to a virgin, you must break the vulva, and she must bleed on you. This is the true marriage and reason it is called the hidden pillar of beauty.
Cherish her. For she is the greatest gift ever given to you from your starry parents. In this way, you honor thy mother and thy father. So long as you treat her well. But also, her son and daughter by you. Because in this way, you and her become one. Which means that you can never truly belong to another. For the celestial marriage is the true marriage. The pure one. Believe her blood is binding. And virginity important.
Believing in her, and the family you make is also equally important. For they will become the reason for your laughter. Yes, the innocent child in its mother’s loving arms cannot be held up in comparison to anything else. But you must shelter them with all of your authority. While, at the same time, bestowing great compassion on them. Even you come from both father and mother which most certainly did not leave you without circumstances that at least taught you temperance.
Now even if you were abandoned yourself, or neglected in any form, you should know it’s not right. And that to abandon or neglect others is the worst thing that a parent can do. For the Shekinyah has never abandoned us. Neither has YHWH. Which is why we must care for widows and orphans to the best of our ability. That they may also share our laughter. We must also fight for fatherless children, and teach them. After all, a fatherless child wrote this for you and yours."

Optimism, including gratitude, moves the revolution forward. What can be more revolutionary than demonstrating that you’re a decent human, when prisoncrats, judges, and the media insists and wishes otherwise?
“The best revenge is massive success”--- Frank Sinatra.
There are people we owe gratitude to right now:

The prisoner who showed you kindness recently
Friends and family who care about you
Maybe a humane prison staffer
Prison abolitionists and supporters, such as PE volunteers

“People will forget what you said...what you did, maybe, but...will never forget how you made them feel”--Maya Angelou
We can make people feel good. Listen, we’ve all had hardships. I promise you mine have been vicious and numerous, long before I came to prison, probably why I came to prison, and probably why some of you did too. Nobody gave a fuck in the system; they just groomed us for the prison cells they had waiting for us. But we can give a fuck, and not give a fuck that giving a fuck seems hopeless!
Some people and things I’m grateful for to the point of tears are:

Pen pals I’ve met, known, and lost over the years. They shared themselves with me and let me be a human
The people at BetweentheBars.org, who run my blog, allowing me to tell my story: http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540
Gary Fine, for starting PE and to all its volunteers!
These fine writers who have stunned me with their brutal honesty (Sean Poulton’s facing Fear essay), their heart (for the “grandparents” topic, SHannon Richardson and Marvin Jones; “Nicknames” topic, Sarah Luedecke; “Leap of Faith”, Kwaneta Harris and Michael Morales), their insight into human nature (“Masks” by Charles Yonkings; “Leap of Faith,” Robert McCracken; “Facing Fear,” Eugene Youngblood), their resistance to the PIC (“Facing Fear,” J Bauhaus; “Modern Day Explorers,” Carl Branson---ya can’t touch me thp’ on viciousness in court!), their wicked satire (both “Docket Call” and “Churchy People” by Matthew Tomlinson), their dark humor/truth (“Introducing Diagonal Taboo” by Matthew Tomlinson; “Tic, Tac, Ticken’ in His Head,” by Michael Lanning; “The Suffering,” Daniel Matthews---all accurately depict how prison warps minds), their light-hearted humor (“Facing Fear,” Catherine LaFleur).

I’m grateful I’m not alone, and I hope you are too.

It’s this country that’s guilty for allowing and participating in such savagery and would now rather pretend it didn’t happen. Yet America openly professes its pride in its history and revels in it. A nation outlives its generations. To proudly claim the World War I veteran and disown the slaveholder is patriotism à la carte. We were not there when Washington crossed the Delaware, or when America fought off the British, but these events still have meaning. We were not there when Wilson took this country into war, but we are still paying out the pensions.

Some nights she’d have me stay in the woods behind their house to witness and quell the unapparent beatings. It was fallacious reasoning. She wanted me close since I’d started drinking again. Was the ‘H’ next?
Two years from my miraculous birth from mother heroin, as I trudged toward the Pizza Hut to meet her for our makeshift holiday dinner, I considered the damage our love had caused. I, a stranger to this town, could walk away. But she was in my bones, nothing but divine intervention would separate us. After spending the prerequisite time with family, she would be there. Always early arriving at our appointments, I expected to see her Ford in the parking lot. The familiar lit up red sign beckoned. Something told me it hovered not over an oasis. Hotels and halfway houses were my homes. Being that this was the last place open Christmas evening, it would be the only place for two people like us to meet.
After ordering a Canadian bacon and pineapple thin crust and a pitcher of beer, I sat and drank while waiting. With half the pizza and a second pitcher gone, along with a dollars worth of sad songs on the juke box, the realization had sunk in. I’d been Judas kissed as our plans were promised. The booth became a confessional. As I peered through the plate glass, an iron overcast horizon intermingled with a jilted reflection; itself far from sainthood. Had the Last Supper been served? With reservation and no ‘Simon’ to bear the load, I walked away. On its second anniversary, essence was crucified. After fourteen years, Easter has yet to come, but its shell preserves. End."

I tossed and turned a little bit before finally looking in my bag for some clothes to slip on. I was moving very slowly - it was still dark outside, for crying out loud - who eats breakfast this early?!
Gradually, I noticed that all of the voices and bustle that I had been hearing had disappeared, replaced by an eerie silence. And that’s when it hit me - the special surprise the adults were hinting at the night before. Could it actually be…
I tore down the hallway half -dressed with my shoes in my hand. There was no one in the dining room, the kitchen, or the living room. My stomach dropped. Right then, the front door opened and one of my aunts and my mom walked in.
“Where is everyone?” I asked, my voice trembling in fear.
“THey just left. They are going to Disney World,” my mom answered with a hint of pity. I didn't believe her. I couldn't believe her. I ran past her to the driveway that was full of cars the night before. There was only one car left. Right there, as the sun had just begun to rise, I fell to the concrete and sobbed.
I spent the longest day of my life stuck in the house nearly alone. I couldn't believe anyone could be so cruel, taking all of the kids but me. Yes, I didn't get up immediately, but I didn't think Disney was a real possibility. We had only been once before, and I don't think my parents liked Disney. We didn't have a lot of money as well, so I couldn't take the prospect seriously. I was so disappointed.
I remember when everyone got back that night, laden with souvenirs and stories of Space Mountain. My dad looked at me and said, “I guess you will do what I tell you next time.” to him, this was an important life lesson. And it was. But i don't want to think I learned the lesson he wanted me to. As you can tell I have thought about this a lot since then. On one hand, I see how spoiled I was. No one is entitled to go to Disney World. But on the other, I just see what feels like cruelty and unfairness. I think maybe both could be true."

Empathy needs to become a mainstay within our lives. We need to learn to be more conscious of our “pack mentality” so that we can rein in those negative aspects that lie just under the surface.
I’m an alpha male and I’ve been locked up my whole life. For the first ten years of my bit, I was always the “leader of the pack” in every situation. As I turned thirty, I began to see those around me for who they really were. The alpha male is only the leader of the pack for as long as he can hold that title. We’ve all seen those shows about lions where the older lion gets pushed out by a younger lion and even though that may not have been the case in my situation, I relate to that proud old lion as he would leave his land and make his way to die all by himself.
For me, I reached that point where I broke free of the hate and all the other ugliness within myself. I was introduced to the wonderful world of Buddhism and the principles it taught. My mind opened up to the world and I have seen how insignificant we all are in the grand scheme of things. The universe is infinite and we are all but a speck of dust. We are here one minute, then we depart this world to start another life anew.
I always keep those thoughts in mind when I’m confronted with other people’s “pack mentality.” The ignorance of it all confounds me. The suffering of life is inevitable. We all walk different paths in life and as I look back upon my own past, I see that everything led up to who I am today. We all evolve into who we were meant to be, for better or for worse. While some people will always live with that “pack mentality,” others will learn to live in the world around them, free of the things that hold them back. Free of the walls that surround them. It is then that we learn to love ourselves, and in turn, learn to love those outside of the “pack.” To me, that is what it truly means to be human. To overcome our animal tendencies and learn to love everything in life. As I sit here and write this, I am no longer an animal within the pack. Today I am a butterfly that lives a beautiful existence. Someone free of the boundaries of the pack.

That’s when I realized I was looking at a well crafted illusion.
Most people in this world of ours don’t believe that things like ghosts, ghouls, and vampires could possibly exist, that anyone who claims to have seen one must just have an overactive imagination or something.
Well, they’re wrong. Take it from me, there are things that go bump in the night.
Since we were the only two around, I surmised that she must be keeping an eye on me.
But why?
I scoured my mind for an answer, but none was forthcoming. Sure, I’ve pissed off more than my fair share of creatures and beasties over the years, but none as of late.
If knowledge is power, then by the same reasoning ignorance must be a weakness. And in the circles I run in, weakness usually equates to dead. That’s why I decided to take a look at the sight.
The sight is an ability that people with magical talent possess. It strips away illusions and glamours allowing one to see things as they actually are.
It comes at a price, though. Once seen, it stays in your memory as fresh as the moment you saw it, forever. And I’ve seen things that have made me want to claw my own eyes out, so it’s not something I choose to do lightly.
But by not using it, I could be putting myself in mortal danger.
Closing my eyes, I activated the sight by concentrating on the Third Eye Chakra located between my eyebrows. I felt the subtle shift in perception and opened my eyes. The world jumped out at me in surreal sharpness, a kind of super 3-D quality, sans pesky glasses.
Keeping my eyes averted, I prepared myself. Finally ready, I looked over and gasped in surprise.
I no longer saw the reclining woman. Instead, standing in front of the bench was the illusion’s source. She stood over six feet tall dressed in a knee-length Greco Roman tunic belted at the waist. A sword in an ornate scabbard rested on her left hip. The elbow joints of her furled wings poked out over her shoulders. Except for her constantly roving glacial blue eyes which seemed to take everything in, she stood preternaturally still.
And I realized that she wasn’t one of the things that go bump in the night.
She was something that kicked the butts of things that go bump in the night.
Now, I don’t know who would send a guardian spirit to watch over me, but I was grateful for it. These were dark and troubled times for me.
Noticing my gaze upon her, she gave me the barest of nods acknowledging that she knew that I knew what she was. Returning her nod, I then closed my sight.
Gravelly, footsteps from behind warned me of someone’s approach. I casually glanced over my shoulder to ascertain who, or what, was approaching but was unable to without turning completely around. My heart started thumping in my chest after noticing the guardian spirit’s illusion was gone.
Stars and stones! What could this be to frighten off such an imposing spirit so readily? I braced myself for whatever might come.
“Mister Butcher, time for your medication,” came a singsong voice from behind.
I allowed myself to relax slightly realizing I wasn’t about to be eviscerated, but that didn’t mean I was out of danger.
“I keep telling you,” I exclaimed, “I don’t need any medications.”
“Come now Mister Butcher, we’ve had this discussion before,” she said stepping around to stand directly in front of me, a tiny clear medication cup filled with a myriad of different colored pills in one hand and a dixie cup with water in the other. Smiling she continued, “We can do this the easy way,” the smile disappeared and her voice dropped to a register known to frighten little children and small animals, “or the hard way. What’s it going to be?”
When the guardian spirit failed to rematerialize and save me, I leaned back my head and opened my mouth, resigning myself to my fate.
Her smile reappeared instantly. “That’s a good boy,” she told me, first dumping the pills in my mouth and then holding the dixie cup to my lips, tipping it back slowly so I could wash them down.
I didn’t even consider checking them knowing what was coming next.
“Open up,” she instructed.
Opening my mouth, I struck out my tongue allowing her to inspect every nook and cranny. “Good job,” she told me in a tone usually reserved for obedient dogs.
I sat sullenly as she walked behind me, taking ahold of the grips of the wheelchair I sat in.
“My nose itches,” I complained as she began wheeling me back towards the buildings.
“Well don’t you worry now, I’ll have you back in your room and out of that jacket in a jiffy. Then you can scratch your nose all you want.” She made a sharp right, heading for the high-security wing of the Beta Foo Mental Asylum. “Then maybe you can work on one of those fanciful stories you like to write.”"

I knew that I had managed to fall short of all the expectations. Despite the faith my family and friends had in me, despite overcoming a myriad of other obstacles and defying the odds in so many ways, I had become just another black man in jail--just another statistic.
Ultimately, I accept that I needed this intervention and earned these consequences. I might have self-corrected my behavior given time, but it unlikely I would have ever been able to identify the logical fallacies upon which my behavior was based without receiving outside help. My familial and fraternal bonds have also been strengthened as so many people have stood by me and supported me. I understand after years of reflection that a statistical correlation says nothing about who a person is. Still, I had lived believing that my life would change the odds for those who would come after, so that the statistics they’d see would paint a rosier picture of what they could expect from life and grant them confidence. All I can say now is that I almost managed to do it."

Those who played music were called “minstrel” which means “music maker.” If we look at (Matt 9:23) it says, “Jesus came into the rules house and saw the minstrel and the people making noise!”
When music was played in worship, the prophets sometimes used music to induce trance or possession by God’s spirit (supernatural power).
Whether you play music to the Lord or for the enjoyment of it, or even for others who enjoy listening to you play!
Remember this, many are not blessed with this talent of music makers, but you were given other useful talents that you may use for the glory of God.
God gives those who play musical instruments to be music to our ears and put joy in our hearts.

Before my arrest, I flew a bit.
I chartered a plane to take aerial photographs. The pilot was calm. I was calm.
I flew in commercial aircraft on business. When necessary, I flew second class. I preferred first class. I have fond memories of reclining under a warm blanket, sipping whiskey, and listening to Charlie Pride.
On vacation, I always travelled by boat, bus, car, or train. I don’t understand why people fly when they’re supposed to be on vacation. “It’s fast.” So what?
I spent most of the year hurrying to meetings, trials, court sessions, appointments. When planning a vacation, I carefully avoid anything that would cause me to be in a hurry.
If my wife was with me, I’d spend hours at the end of the day slowly bringing her to her ultimate destination. Then I’d roll over and allow myself to drift away. I felt like I was flying."

This older gentleman put it to me in words as such: “Them vikings you love so much weren’t all warriors, some of them had to row the boat! Everyone needs help sometimes.” Even though I viewed this man in a state of respect, I couldn’t bring myself to talk to him and ask for his help.
In the religion of Astru there is a big emphasis on ancestors, so I took my plea before the Ancestral Spirits. I asked them to help me find myself and shortly thereafter started corresponding with an Asatruar Holyman. He himself went through similar trials of not knowing one’s self, and in turn helped me to find Kevin.
Now that I know who I am as a man, life is a lot smoother and easier. Codependency isn’t a weakness and in order to help others, we must first help ourselves out of our own way. Since Drighten Joe’s helping me and the Gods and Goddesses intercession in my life I now know me. I found the boy inside and the man no one got to see."

Roxi says they should all work. I grab two. I ask Roxi to remind me why I am going to the airport at 2 AM. She says because she’s awesome.
I call a valet to bring my E-Class up. I grab a red bull from Roxi’s fridge. I give the valet a twenty and the Red bull. I tell them Roxi is at the airport and we’ll arrive shortly.

She says her company always flies United and her last time being on time was ten flights ago. Today the plane runs out of fuel and they have to stop at another airport. They sit on the tarmac for a couple of hours before taking off once more.
She asks me for my car phone number. I tell Roxi not even my parents have my car number. She gives me her car number and says to call her.
Roxi wants to race home. I remind her this area is a speed trap. She says I’m worried my E-class can’t beat her 5 series. I tell her my car is two years newer than hers and it can beat her. I also tell her I could’ve saved money by staying asleep. I give the valet a twenty. I am in the airport only thirty minutes and get charged 9 dollars for parking. This call is costing me by the minute. Now I’m going to waste gas racing home.
She says she’s taking me and my wife to dinner. She’ll get us into Trece, Nobu, or Nick & Sams tonight. I tell her I’ll call Sam. She says she’ll call Nick.

Society is becoming an unnatural place, moving away from a familial or tribal social construct and toward an escapist and comfortable, yet numbing path through digital means. The impersonal nature of communication does not allow for the building of trust so vulnerability can happen. Proper bonding does not, then happen. People are left to create layers of themselves, fictional masks, different faces that they show to the variety of people or groups they encounter throughout the day. These are defenses built up to defend against being harmed. It’s the opposite of vulnerability and it’s uncomfortable. People can become lost under the layers life has caused them to create, with seemingly no way to take off the masks and be honest and real.
There is, though, the adage that “comfort kills.” In prison there’s a critical need to protect yourself from emotional and physical harm. Being vulnerable can make a person a victim. Act like a victim and be a victim, talk like a victim and be a victim. Predators are everywhere and there are all sorts of them around. Not all can be easily identified.
Also, everytime you share something with one person, they generally will repeat what was said to three other people. And those three people will repeat it to three more people. So, this can make the idea of becoming vulnerable and finding a modicum of comfort even more fleeting or distant.
I’ve been in prison for 14 years, and have the equivalent of a life sentence to serve. I feel that I am “on” all the time and am unable to trust anyone. I’ve been hurt enough throughout my life, and usually by people I trusted, but on different levels. What one can be trusted with, another cannot. It’s so tiring that I see not only myself but many others simply stop trying to be genuinely social, in a sense that would create the vulnerable state needed to gain real trust and bonding.
Instead, we find some fleeting common ground with a variety of the people forced to be here which, with luck, may create an atmosphere that isn’t too difficult to navigate. I’m a prolific writer who’s sensitive and carries my emotions on my sleeve and I still (though I don’t understand why) enjoy trying to help people. I’ve tried to surround myself with like-minded people for those activities, or I just remove myself from everything. Honestly, I find it is better to be by myself, which is sad in some base way. I’ve found that being vulnerable here is impossible and should not, in fact, cannot be done in any real sense.
In all, prison is a lonely and unnatural place where a lot of bad things happen. It’s probably best to not be vulnerable, or not too vulnerable. That is sad, huh? But it does make me appreciate the rare moments when I can tell my truth, connect and be vulnerable."

They squeaked to an idling halt, close behind me. I tried to ease my mind with the notion that perhaps they were just hoping to run my sham of a license plate number through their criminal databases. My gaze briefly returned to the ceaseless countdown upon my wrist.
THIRTY SECONDS TO GO -
I stared back at the two officers through the tinted and impenetrable obscurity of my rear window. One of them was now motioning his spotlight in the y direction, searching to no avail of course. The other badge was typing into her laptop with one hand, and reaching for her radio with the other. I smoothly retracted my sunroof, and released my silence glock .19 from its holster. Tapering wisps of beclouded matter invaded the interior of my four-wheeled fortress. The alarm on my watch chimed to life in a high-pitched, 8-bit, stutter.
TIMES UP -
I rose to greet my unexpected guests with an incisive fluidity and aim. From my peripheral vision, I could see my crime caper cohorts heaving our heavy haul of pilfered  currency out onto the sidewalk. They were hulking and unfocused shadows amidst the billowing murk. The two impetuous officers had no time to react to my crooked comrades’ abrupt appearance. I squeezed the trigger of my automatic pistol in three short bursts. A rapid succession of muted flames and molten lead sliced through the thick and feathery pall. Splashes and smatterings of crimson and splintered glass made their cruiser a grisly tableau of grim mortality.
I turned and sat back swiftly, discarding my temporal fears through a deep exhale. My amoral associates, and our load of larcenous loot, were inside the vehicle like flashes of fleeting lightening. I pressed the ignition, and shifted through the gears, to begin our gliding getaway. Mother Nature dispersed her shroud of suspended mist from my path in curling crests. I felt comfort in the thought that these compacted and rolling waves of atmospheric molecules were reminiscent of the tropical surf I would be retiring to shortly.
We rode onward, in a triumphant and mesmeric silence. A smile of relished relief had begun to chisel its curvature into my long hardened facial features. I pulled off my mask, and allowed the wind to take it from my hands, into the oblivion outside of my shutting sunroof. The blurred and blended hues of daybreak had begun to rise and saturate through the receding meteorological muddle. I eagerly smashed my foot forward on the accelerator - speeding toward the feeling of finality and financial freedom."

Where exactly did all that energy come from? There was no sudden change in your eating or sleeping habits. Yet when your girlfriend comes by, you end up talking all night and going out to see the sunrise in the morning. You’re not tired at all. You’re together again and you’re holding hands and these rushes of joy just won’t stop overwhelming you. People see you and they remark that you look like a bundle of light. Where did all this energy come from?
If you watch carefully, you have a phenomenal amount of energy inside of you. It doesn’t come from food or sleep. This energy is always available to you. At any moment you can draw upon it. It just wells up and fills you from inside. When you’re filled with this energy, you feel like you could take on the world. When it is flowing strongly, you can actually feel it coursing through you in waves. It gushes up spontaneously from deep inside and restores, replenishes, and recharges you.
The only reason you don’t feel this energy all the time is because you block it. You block it by closing your heart, mind, and by pulling yourself into a restrictive space inside. This closes you off from all the energy. When you close your heart or close your mind, you hide in the darkness within you. There is no light. There is no energy. There is nothing flowing. The energy is still there but it can’t get in.
This is what it means to be “blocked”. That is why you have no energy when you’re depressed. There are centers within that channel your energy flow. When you close them, there is no energy. When you open them, there is. Although various energy centers exist within you, the one you intuitively know the most about opening and closing is your heart. Let’s say you love somebody, and you feel very open in their presence. Because you trust them, your walls come down, allowing you to feel lots of high energy. If they do something you don’t like, the next time you see them you don’t feel so high. You don’t feel as much love. Instead, you feel a tightness in your chest. This happens because you close your heart. The heart is an energy center, and it can open or close."

The show starts and all four of us at the table were waiting for David to need a person to help him out. With the beach ball trick we quickly batted them away from our table. Finally, David’s assistant is close to our table. The lights come up and David sees where he needs to end up. David goes all over the theatre looking for the perfect helper. He arrives at our table and asks the man if he will help him.
They both go up on stage. David has the man hold a large wooden bucket with a lid. David is holding a goose that is a stuffed animal. He tells the story of how he always wanted a real life goose. He puts the stuffed animal in the bucket and says the magic words. He tells the man to tip over the bucket. David says something is not right.. David tells the story again and puts the stuffed animal in the bucket. He says the magic words again and tells the man to tip the bucket over. A real live goose tumbles out flapping its wings and making noise. David picks up the goose and hands it to his assistant.
At our table, the three of us are waiting for the man to come back and explain how the trick was done. He was given an autographed photo of David Copperfield for helping him with the trick. He said he had no idea how the trick was done. He did not even know that a goose was involved. All they told him was how to hold the bucket and how to tip it over.
The rest of the show was great. David Copperfield does not disappoint. At the end of the show the Canadian couple asked if we would join them for drinks at Treasure Island.

Yet we do worry about our apparently impending doom in a way no rock, tree or computer can.
“Scientists” dismiss questions about the causes of the Big Band as “meaningless”, although they obviously are not; but here’s the real question we should be talking about. What is the origin of the entity that views the earth, sea, and sky through this physical body (I’ll use the word “soul”, you might substitute “spirit”, “ghost”, or whatever according to your religious background)?
Every human being has one (a soul). Does it come into being ex nihilo at the moment of conception? Do unborn souls exist in galut somewhere outside of time? Either way, we must have a creator and a purpose. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom. Proverbs 1:7, 9:10
The purpose of man is to know and love his creator in this world and to be with Him in eternity. God has a further purpose for each individual.
If you’re contemplating your personal purpose, inspiration and helpful advice can be found in Purpose Driven Life by my cousin Rick Warren (I don’t know his exact lineage but my great great great great great great great great grandfather was Richard Warren). It’s a 40 day study -- please don’t take any shortcuts.
I was a lawyer. Actually I am a lawyer but I was an attorney at law. I didn’t trade clients or coerce people to plead guilty. I tried cases -- and won. I embarrassed crooked cos and corrupt prosecutors in their own courtrooms, in newspapers and on television.
No, I’m a political prisoner. People ask how I maintain such a positive attitude when most people my situation would have killed themselves or gone crazy. My own goals (all centered aroudn serving God and raising my children in knowledge and love of Him) have been thwarted by a perverted DA who has since become a judge; but God still has a purpose for my life. If I truly love Him, I will go to my grave seeking to know and to do His will."

I hated myself. I became a drug addict, tried to commit suicide, and went to prison 4 times. I was the poster child for not being tuned in to what I was supposed to be doing. All because I was scared of failure.
I was on the verge of giving up again a couple years ago. Headed back to prison with an 18 year sentence. My wife had filed for divorce, after years of us not really being together. My new fiance left me. I knew that I might never see my stepdaughters again. I consider them my real daughters. They call me daddy Jay and are the closest things to children of my own that I have. I felt like what was the use of trying?
Then it hit me. I was already a failure. There was no need to be scared of it anymore. I had so many emotions, so many things I wanted to say, and the only way to get those out was on paper. Who cares if no one wanted to read what I wrote? I couldn’t hold it all inside any longer. I had to get it out.
So I started writing, and a funny thing happened. The pain and sadness never disappeared, but it lessened. I could escape this world filled with hurt and enter one that I create.
I could live happily through the characters in my stories. I finished a book called “We Were Just Kids”, and published it online at a place called www.prisonsfoundation.org.
I started praying again. Trying to build a closer relationship to God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit. I found that as long as I wrote, prayed, and stayed in contact with my family, I didn’t need antidepressants anymore. Writing was my medicine.
People started reading my stuff, and they enjoyed it. The smiles on people’s faces when they hear my stories, the genuine interest they have in the things I write keeps me going. They make me see how much of a fool I was for not writing before.
The emptiness inside me has faded somewhat with each prayer and story. I still feel bad sometimes, but not as bad as I used to. I finally feel like I’m in tune with what I’m supposed to be doing.
We will never feel like we are in tune with the world, until we get past that fear of failure that’s so gripping that it keeps us from trying. A little fear is healthy, but too much fear is suffocating.
What scares me more now is the thought of what I would have been. If I had never decided to finally take this leap of faith and confidence, then I’d still be the person I was before I got here. It would be twice as hard to wake up at 70 and realize I have so much to say still, so many dreams I never went after, and not enough time to complete them.
If you’ve got something you feel like you should be doing, but are too scared to try or think that there’s always tomorrow, don’t put it off another day.

Critters of all shapes and sizes crawled forth from their winter burrows, some with young in tow and others in search of a mate. Birds-of-a-feather flock back from warmer, more southern climates to build their nests. Each spring, I sought to see my first robin with its reddish breast, heralding the official return of spring. Much of the season’s rapid movement was the result of insects: buzzing bees dancing from flower to flower, spiders spinning webs in search of a meal that glistened in the sun on dew-dampened mornings; and alien-looking caterpillars eating their way through their first incarnation of life, preparing to cocoon and fly into their next. Everywhere I looked, I found life in motion: rabbits, squirrels, and skunks, tadpoles, waterbugs, fish and lizards. Once while digging in the dirt, I unearthed a nest with dozens of baby rattlesnakes. Immediately, they raised their heads and upper bodies out of the dirt. They angrily swayed back and forth in defense of their home and in protest of my accidental intrusion.
Finally, spring was a time for people. Gardens were dug and planted. Lawn furniture, outside toys and yard decorations were pulled from their winter storage, cleaned, and put on display. I enjoyed little more than running barefoot on a lush green carpet of thick grass, or lazing on a warm rock, listening to the creek babel after a cold, quiet winter. Happiness for me was seeing flocks of sheep with their new spring lambs frolicking in pastures. I felt alive breathing in the fresh air, taking in a kaleidoscope of colors, the explosion of movement, the symphony of sound, the bouquet of fragrances that we call spring."

The nurse has already placed a stool by my wife’s head so I can provide her emotional support through the birth. I can’t see the doctor cutting into my wife’s belly from where I’m sitting, which is just as well. I whisper comforting words to my wife as the doctors and nurses do their thing. Within what seemed a very short couple of minutes, the doctor asks me, “Dad, you want to see your daughter enter this world?” I stand up and watch the doctor pull my daughter’s tiny body from my wife’s belly. Quickly, the nurse whisks her to another station to clean her up and take her APGAR scores. She struggles to breathe at first, but otherwise all seems fine.
“Come on over here, dad. You want to hold your beautiful daughter?” Tears jump to my eyes as I gently cradle her in my arms. She’s so tiny! Her body fits into the palm of my hand. Her hands and feet are the size of my thumbs. Too quickly, the nurse takes my daughter and brings her to my wife. She kisses her and cries over how beautiful she is, but soon our baby is whisked away again to the neonatal unit. Born two months early, she only weighs 3lbs. 15oz., and she’s still struggling to breath on her own.
After spending several weeks in the hospital, my daughter is finally released to come home with us. She’s on a breathing monitor because she still struggles to breathe on her own, but otherwise she’s doing great. The next several exhausting months fly by, and my daughter makes astonishing progress in growth. Months have now turned into years and my daughter is no longer a tiny baby. Those tiny feet are no longer piddle paddling all over the house. They no longer follow me everywhere or stand on my feet as we dance together. Today, she’s a remarkable and intelligent young woman. She’s an accomplished senior in high school and she’s taller than most girls her age. I’d give anything to hold her tiny little hands in mine again, to cradle her tiny feet in the palm of my hand. Instead, I hold all of her tenderly in my heart."

No matter the signs, they played on. What is this? they all wondered. It's a drizzle of rain, was heard murmured by the crowd as they stirred and played in the rain.
Pouncing the puddles, they danced with stride, smiles and laughter came from them all. Twisting and turning, dripping wet, enjoying the showers as they poured down. And the sound of the rushing rage creeped upon them though they continued a rage of lusts and laughers of their own…
Another flash and a crash, then a panic in their minds filtered their pasts. Stunned by the storm's wrath, leveled by the rivers flow, a flood began to rise and their panic began to show with screams of horror.
""Help us,"" someone called out. ""He's just a baby,"" another yelled, ""forgive us"", one cried, but it was too late. There was nothing anyone could do and by the time they comprehended the consequences of their actions, the wood made craft was tossed by a rage of the tides. The wind's pounding force pushed and carried the boat, tossing her throughout a frightful night. From cap to cap, we drifted off into the unknown. As the Earth's breath shifted a cool breeze upon us, our sway from port to starboard was at peace. The sky was at a dim gray and the sun had not shown itself for days. A scent of freshness fills our day with delight as we work with pride. Still, with enchantment, we worked and life goes on regardless of what each day may bring.
With a sudden jostle, the grasp of a shallow shore bottom creeps us to a halt. The shoreline peeks its face through the receding waters below. The sun shares a ray of light through one of the windows as we all look on with utter excitement. With a smile, all of the windows are opened taking into a shining new day of summer. Though water is all that is seen, a tear of joy fills our eyes and for all of the lost, that could not be saved.
Tap. Tap. Crash. A good morning awakened with the crash of our doors being unsealed. A rush of fresh air came in with a mighty push. As we looked upon the door with amazement, at last, the Earth's surface is dry. The waters have receded and the view outside is so beautiful.
Then God said to Noah, ""leave the boat. All of you- you and your wife and sons and their wives. Release all of the animals so they can be fruitful and multiply throughout the Earth.""
So, Noah and his family released all of the animals, large and small. All of the birds came out of the boat pair by pair. Oh what beauty has the Lord our God brought forth on this day. And so, we shall give thanks and offerings to our God.
Noah and his sons set off in search of a perfect courtyard to build an altar for the Lord. The world seemed so clear, so clean, so fresh, and so peaceful. One could only imagine what the top of Mt. Ararat would have been in the brightness of this day.
The flock of the air caught their attention when Japheth spotted the dove his father sent out in search of dry land. It was perched on an olive branch of fresh bloom. Surrounded by water that receded with the tide. Hidden by the sea by day. Rising up by night. This would preserve its beauty so they all gathered what was needed to build a temple for the Lord our God.
Within a few days, a newly built structure of God formed around the old olive tree where the birds of the air made their home. There, Noah and his family who would repopulate the Earth sacrificed and unblemished animals appropriate for this purpose. The lord was pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice and said unto thee,"" I will never again curse the ground of the human race."" and the covenant of our God to Noah and the Earth was made at the top of Mt. Ararat this day using a rainbow as the sign of their covenant forever.
Noah and his family were fruitful and fill the earth with many. They cultivated the land and were bleeding. With each Sabbath, an offering was given to the Lord at the Altar that Noah and his sons built after the flood. As it stands today, hidden by the day, raised up by the night, the Altar of the Lord remains."

The funny part is that doing so turned out to be the easiest part of my transformation process. The hardest part was developing the traits of strength, integrity, and honesty in an environment as negative as prison.
I had though! Otherwise, the board wouldn’t have found me suitable for parole.
Now that the day arrived, I found my excitement mixed with trepidation. For fifteen years, my life has been on hold while the world continued on without me. This new world of advanced digital devices and social media was alien to me, and I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect.
It wasn’t like I had anyone to guide me through this time. Both my parents had passed away, I’d lost contact with all my friends over the years, and neither of my ex-wives wanted anything to do with me. In fact, my first ex-wife denied me contact with my only daughter on the grounds that I’d broken too many of the commandments.
But if there’s one thing prison has shown me, it’s that with the proper mental attitude, you can adapt and overcome anything. So while some people might feel hopeless in my situation, I saw it simply as an opportunity to achieve, not that it would be easy!
When my escort came to get me, I grabbed the clear trash bag containing the few possessions I was taking with me, took one last look around, and headed out. The drizzle of the early morning had since turned into a downpour.
Walking through the rain on my last day in prison, I couldn’t besmirch my time here. The way I see it, prison probably saved my life and kept me from hurting more innocent people. It gave me the opportunity to take a close look at my life and to then transform myself into the person I’ve always wanted to be.
Arriving at R&R, I was put into a holding cell all by myself. I guess I was the only one lucky enough to be paroling today. The R&R sergeant took pity on me and let me change into my dress outs right away instead of making me sit there soaked. I thanked him for his kindness.
My processing went quickly enough, and I soon found myself back in the holding cell. While I had encountered the “hurry up and wait” phenomenon over 30 years ago in the army, time didn’t lessen the levels of frustration that accompanied it.
After two hours, I asked what the delay was. I was told they had received a call informing them that my ride was delayed by the weather. Ride? I was under the impression I’d just be loaded on a Greyhound and sent on my way.
As time continued to slowly crawl by, I sat there trying to stay relaxed and keep my thoughts calm. Truth be told, I had this paranoid thought that this was all a joke, that shortly they would come up to the bars of the holding cell and yell, “Psych!” They would then change me back into my blues and escort me back to my yard while laughing at my naivete of thinking they’d actually let me out after what I did.
Knowing that I was my own worst enemy at times like this, I breathed and let things go and focused instead on my dreams and hopes for the future. On top of that list was finding my daughter to discover whether or not she wanted me back in her life. Unfortunately, I had no idea where to start, and I didn’t know what her mom may have told her. Part of my motivation for change was the desire to become someone she could be proud of, and until I knew otherwise, I would continue under the assumption she might want me back in her life; I had to keep a positive mentality.
After what seemed an eternity, I was informed that my ride arrived and that it was time to go. Standing up straight, I grabbed my things and headed out to begin a new chapter in my life.
My escort walked me in silence to the salle port. He pointed to a car outside the fences, identifying it as my ride. I could dimly see someone sitting in the driver’s seat, obviously staying out of the rain.
Passing through the final gate, I made my way toward the parked car. As I approached, the driver’s side door opened and an umbrella popped open sheltering the driver from the chill rain. I stopped a respectful distance away. When the driver stood, I stared in shock at a face I hadn’t seen in 15 years. Luckily, the pouring rain hid the tears now streaming down my face as I heard the words I longed to hear: “Hello Daddy.”"

This is Tara’s eight packet of tips and insights into practical techniques and inspirations for successful meditation. Prisoner Express also sent me the book “Universal Kabbalah” by Sheldon Stoff, Jesse Stoff, and Lorraine Stoff. The book offers forms of guided visualizations. It points out on page 12 that there are two methods to attain a higher level of consciousness or a mystical state. There is meditation and there are drugs. On page 14, the book points out that when we pray, we speak to the Spiritual World; when we meditate, we listen. Mind’s Eye allows full duplex conversations with the Spiritual World.
Mind’s Eye alarms some shallow-minded people. At 0110 hours on Thursday, November 2, 2017, one day before the Full Moon, a guard named Weatherford decided she couldn’t see me breathing. She banged on the door of my cell. My cohort is in administrative segregation and they normally bang on their cell doors all night long. The noise brought no response. She radioed for a sergeant. He banged on my cell door. There was no response. The sergeant radioed for a lieutenant. He abused my cell door. There was no response. I was elsewhere, via Mind’s Eye.
Mind’s Eye makes some people panic. The lieutenant radioed medical to report an unresponsive offender. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center employees radioed back that they had nobody to send, so it didn’t matter. The lieutenant radioed Central Control to open my cell door. The lieutenant tapped me on my leg. That returned me to Terra, and I woke up.
Prisoner Express is part of Durland Alternatives Library. Prisoner Express makes Tara’s meditation packet and other alternative resources freely available to you. Utilize these alternative resources. They will train you in methods to control the radio waves of your mind. Meditation is one way. Guided visualizations are another. Enjoy alternative research into the alternative cosmos.

Strip malls and tracts of planned housing developments marked the outskirts of Casa Grande, our destination city.
The doctor’s office was another surprise. Rather than some one-house private operation, it was an elaborate corporate assembly line set up with at least twenty-four eye specialists on staff. Photos of each doctor were posted in the entry foyer. My eye exam, I believe, was carried out efficiently over the course of an hour as I was moved from station to station without delay, including a digital photo of my retina.
Being exposed to the hustle and bustle of contemporary city life gave me a new appreciation for the easy-going, laid back environment that exists in our yard. It also made me realize exactly how lazy I’ve become while in prison. But, by the same token, I have concluded that I would prefer the pressure of deadlines, performance standards, and other tensions of modern life on the other side of the razor wire."

If so, can you literally turn with me to –
Jeremiah 32:17 Now read it. What does it say? Do you believe that?
Jeremiah 32:17 Ah my Lord God! You made the heavens, and the earth with your great power and your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for you. Do you believe that?
Jeremiah 32:27 I am the Lord the God of all the living. Is anything too difficult for me?
Isaiah 40:26-31 Go There! Lift up your eyes on high and see who created these. He leads out their army, and numbers then calling them, all by name. By his great might and the strength of his power not one of them is missing.
Why O Jacob do you say and declare, O Israel my way is hidden from the lord and my right is disregarded by my God
Do you not know? Have you not heard? The lord is God from old, creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary and his knowledge is beyond scrutiny.
He gives power to the faint, abundant strength to the weak.
Through young men faint and grow weary, and youths stagger and fall
They that hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar on eagle’s wings. They will run and not grow weary, walk and not grow faint. All of these scriptures.
That I have just shared with you speaks of someone greater than you who is willing to give you a helping hand but you cannot take his promises lightly because he is a God of truth.
Numbers 23:19 God is not a human being who speaks falsely, nor a mortal who feels regret. Is God one to speak and not act, to decree and not bring it to pass? I’m here to tell you that God will give you a helping hand. All it takes is efficacious prayer, and unconditional trust. That means trusting him when you don’t understand. God can see things in you that you can’t see in yourself. His plan for your life is bigger than you plan but God doesn’t take us in a straight line. Part of his plan involves twists, turns disappointments, losses and bad breaks
If you have conditional trust you’ll get discouraged and think why is this happening, but God is still directing your steps. Trust him even when it feels as though you’re going in the wrong direction. God has the final say. Right now he is working out his plan for you life. There may be some fiery furnaces. Are you going to trust him only if he delivers you from the fire. I believe with all of my from the fire. I believe with all of my heart that if you trust him he is faithful to give a helping hand.

So, even in prison, I have many things I can enjoy and be thankful for, without the trap of unhealthy attachment.
I can name many little things I am thankful for almost every day in prison. I am at CML West on the central California coast. The weather is mild and variable. I live in a dormitory whose doors are never locked. The prison yard I live in has picnic tables under shade trees and beautiful views of surrounding hills through chain link fences. There are beautiful landscape plantings all around with lovely flowers, caci and even places for inmates to grow food items such as tomatoes, peppers, cantaloupes, etc.
I am thankful that my prison yard has domestic cats-two of which are my daily friends and comforters. We have birds all around the yard. I am thankful for the raccoons and the wild turkeys that live around us. We even have resident Red-tailed Hawks, and I have seen Cooper’s Hawks, Peregrine Falcons and even Golden Eagles overhead! I am a raptor fanatic and licensed raptor breeder, so these raptor sightings on a regular basis are something I am extremely thankful for.
I am also thankful for ongoing support of my friends who write letters, send books and send money occasionally. This support keeps me going.
These are so many blessings that I have now that I never would have had it not for this prison experience. I live in close proximity with all sorts of people of races and backgrounds I would have never encountered in my home in Marin County CA. And when the undesirable circumstances arise, I am learning to deal with them with equanimity.
So much to be thankful for now. But if I am released on appeal, I will be even more thankful."

The birds were aware of the addition to their environment, as they chirped – sometimes slowly and sometimes vociferously – as they cocked their heads to hear and try to see where the strange occurrence was emanating from.
As we hiked along the seldom used trail, the birds flew along side as if guiding us to our desired haven, although, we thought, it was unknown to them.
There became apparent to us a faint sound. The eerie subtle sound of an Aeolian harp as sometimes played by the wind as it moves through the trees of the forest, but there was no such wind this day.
As we walked along the trail our Spirits were crying for leaving. I looked behind at the trail. It was closing in behind us.
The sound was getting louder by gentle increments of decibels, and the wind began to whisper as the sound became familiar. It was the sound of a wind pipe: a flute. The Piper was leading us on.
The birds flew in formation toward the Piper who was ‘leading us to reason’. All the trees of the woods began to rejoice before the Lord.
The trail back was now gone, there was now way out, and the wind began to whisper, “Come... Come…”
‘Our heads were humming and it won’t go, ‘cause we don’t know, the Piper’s calling to join –’
As we approached the edge of the meadow, the joyful notes from the pipe gave quietus to our souls and the pipe pointed to the west, and the whispering wind became visible.
The birds chirped with glee as they led the way across the meadow, and we followed the sound of the Piper, and ‘the forest would echo with laughter’.
We moved across the meadow – our feet not touching the ground – toward the whispering wind, and ‘there walks a lady we all know who shines white light and wants to show’ – that we’re all buying a stairway to Heaven.

As a result, he wielded great power over the younger boys, who all vied for spots on his crew.
It was a sunny summer Saturday afternoon, which meant that the chickenhawks would be swarming; this meant more money. More money meant Mama would be happy. And when Mama was happy, everyone was happy-- especially Roger, who would get the biggest cut of the boys.
At first, Dayton watched from the sidelines, wearing his new sleeveless T-shirt, swim trunks and sandals, which Mama had bought him for just this occasion.
“Can I help? Please, please?” Dayton begged, when he saw the other boys splashing one another, seemingly having a good time.
Looking down at Dayton’s cherubic face, how could Roger say no?
“Sure. Go have fun,” he said.
Roger watched as Dayton grabbed a bucket, squealing in joy as the other boys soaked him. He looked like a newborn baby chick.
A beat-up rusty Nova pulled up. The driver motioned Roger over. The guy was a typical sleazeball: greasy hair, pockmarked face, and a mustache.
“What’s up?” Roger asked.
“How much for him?” the guy asked, nodding toward Darton.
“He’s not working.”
“Looks like he is to me.”
“He’s in training.”
What better a way to learn than the thought of what this guy would do with Dayton. Dayton was much younger than Roger when he had been initiated into this life. It had been a painful and traumatic experience for Roger, so surely it would be worse for Dayton. Roger still had nightmares about it, which he tried blotting out with dope, and he didn’t want Dayton to be doomed to a similar existence. When he looked over his shoulder, Roger saw Dayton having such innocent fun. No amount of money for dope was worth spoiling that purity.
“I tell ya what: I’ll give you a freebie.”
“Well, you ain’t him, but free is free.”
Roger climbed into the passenger’s seat and did his thing within eyeshot of Dayton, who splashed and romped, unaware of the depravity just feet away.
As always, Roger felt terrible afterwards. But knowing Dauton was spared the same indignities made the ordeal tolerable. Dayton’s presence alone brought in enough extra customers and tips. Mama would be more than pleased by this. And there was always the cellophane baggie of hope, and the cherubs that would sing to him from within."

Wisner
We’re given many things in life and choices are one of them. Some choices are small and insignificant; while others command prominence in our lives. We can look back on our past and see the path our choices have led us down. Standing upon the greatest vantage point, tomorrow, we can clearly discern the quality of our choices. That’s the catch, it’s hindsight. One in particular stands out from the rest. It will have such an effect that the shock waves shall be felt for years to come. This decision was made in the fledgling hours of October 4, 2014. Clearly this life changing event was the culmination of about fourteen years of bad choices. I had been subconsciously grooming myself all these years to make the wrong choice on that day. It was the day I decided to steal twenty one guns. And as all bad decisions tend to do, it led to another horrendous display of decision making skill. What was this display you ask? Well it was the logical choice to try and sell those guns. Now if it wasn’t enough that people in my life were trying to get me to shape up and be successful in life, even Facebook was hinting that I should think this deal through. I came across a post that talked about Mercury being in retrograde around this time. And if you didn’t know when Mercury is in retrograde, you don’t make any life altering decision or business deals. I did not heed this sage advice delivered by the all knowing social media giant, or any warning for that matter. In my mind, the plan I had concocted was perfect. So perfect in fact, that I was already spending those imaginary dollars. As I look back, from my vantage point and realize nothing on earth could have changed my mind. This bad choice had an interesting side effect though. Because of the seven years I received for my crimes, I was given a tremendous amount of time for introspection. This had led to a plan and direction for my life that was absent all those previous years. I had just been floating through life till that point. I was indifferent towards my future and ambivalent towards success of any kind. Now the next seven years after my release are planned out. I have contingencies if my plans fail. This is no longer just a joyride for me. There is another passenger in this car now. She has been a catalyst for this dramatic change that’s gone through me. Her success is directly tied to my own. And for her to have the best chance at creating her best life that she can’ she is going to need a good foundation to start from. Luckily I have had a tremendous amount of help in making sure her early years are filled with love and a proper place to grow up in my absence. This is all about choosing what’s important to you. Those things change over time as we grow up. The main idea should not change: to provide for the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for you and yours. I plan to have a better life than my parents did, in the hopes that my daughter can do the same. And so on down the line. That’s me deciding to work towards betterment of my family for future generations. I have rediscovered the tools to make good decisions that were imbued in me by my parents. I had the ability all along; I just failed to use them.

The cuff is too large and the corners aren’t right.”
I was on my way to pick up my daily dose of allergy medicine. I told her “sure” and left. When I returned to my cell, I noted elf number two had flipped the blanket again and the patches were once again visible on the top. That’s how I knew she had remade the bed.
At 6:45am elf number three knocked on my door. “Hi Catherine, I’m making all the beds on the top tier. Do you mind if I remake your bed, it’s not tight enough.”
I paused for just a moment. “Sure, have at it, I’m going to make a cup of tea.” When I returned, my patched blanket was spread patches side down. That’s how I knew she had remade my bed.
Moments later, a casual observer came to my cell to tell me that three people had come in while I was out of the dorm. I shrugged my shoulders in a “what’s-a-girl-to-do” manner then thanked her and told her the three elves had my permission.
After count at 7:45am, elf number four showed up at my cell and said, “Hey LaFleur, do you mind if I remake your bed when you leave the dorm for work call?”
All I could say was “No, no, I don’t mind at all.”
Now I did not tell any of the elves about each other. I’m pretty sure that they were criticizing my bed-making skills, unaware that they were in fact correcting each other’s work. Still, I’m grateful that I cannot be held responsible for this bed. When I returned to the dorm in the afternoon, I discovered that my laundry bag was not in compliance. Elves! What can you do?"

He pulled out his smartphone, remotely began video-recording and live-streaming to their extended family and the minister, and started some light music. Both Art and Addie expelled a breath of elated satisfaction as their homespun nuptials commenced.
Adowa ambled towards Arturo in rhythmic pauses, tot-in-tow, while the automated-drone wafted flower petals before her. As she reached Art, their digital preacher began his jovial oration. Soon came time for the betrothed to vocalize their heartfelt vows, and for the exchange of their rings and joyful tears. Finally, it was time for Arturo and Adowa to indulge in their first kiss as husband and wife - but, their little one had alternative plans. She unexpectedly awoke in Adowa’s arms, wailing and thrashing in a sleepy stupor of exasperation and hunger. As their ceremony was brought to an abrupt closing, so that they could pamper their precious princess, Art and Addie couldn’t help but smile and giggle at one another.
As the sun finally dipped below the plum-tinged horizon, blessings and goodbyes had been expressed together with their digitized loved ones, and everything had been repacked away. Adowa and Arturo embraced each other in the soft seaside undergrowth, beneath the awakening stars. Their infant laid betwixt them on a blanket, coddled and guzzling down her bottle contentedly. Adowa rested her ring hand on Arturo’s, and looked up at him. Arturo dove into the center of Addie’s soft caramel irises, and she lost herself in his smoky grays. They kissed with a mellifluous and soul-binding passion, and for the first time that whole momentous evening - they were ONE."

And, a lot of inmates are bologna hogs. They steal, beg or buy as much of it as they can get and gobble it down as quickly as they can. You can tell these people by their big, basketball-size bellies pooching out in front of them like the prow of a ship. They eat “Tums” by the handful and pile stuff up under the front of their jail pads, so it raises their lungs up above their mountain of belly. This is so that big sack of fat won’t smother them, which it would if they lay down flat and level.
Over the years of stuffing their guts, cancer slowly builds. Between 5 and 20 years of scarfing scrap meats, their guts get to hurting so badly that they have to go get a foot or so of diseased intestine chopped out. Then cancer gets worse in other parts of their guts. The doctors never tell them the truth (“you’re going to die before two years ago by”), because they want their doomed patients to have a false sense of hope, in the form of a “positive attitude.” They have been taught that a positive attitude makes their patients live longer. I know that a positive attitude lets them think that “one more dagwood sandwich can’t hurt.”
Every major prison has a dark, secluded set of cages full of these not quite yet dead men watching TV, with shit up their backs, waiting to die. The prison rats keep this situation very quiet because they know that it is the direct result of the poisonous prison diet. They know that alimentary canal cancer deaths in prison are many times higher than the rate found among free people who can choose to eat non-poisonous food or less poisonous food. This guilty knowledge makes them fear that they may get caught holding the malpractice bag when this story breaks. When a captive dies, nobody cares. He died as soon as the gate slammed shut behind him if he was stuck here long enough to catch colon cancer. Your family slowly backs away, waving and smiling farther and farther. Then, when you can barely still see them, they turn around and go. You don’t even realize it, because the process is so gradual. You die slowly in prison. They go have their holiday reunions. Your name never comes up, you’re totally forgotten. You can’t even remember any family reunion."
1341,“I Was Only Looking” by Carl Nunnery,,No,2019.0,01 - January,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Girlfriend-Meme-picture-f61e0d642b564776bbea50081735c65d,Anna Nguyen,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCI8_LIsCQDyMlPAkX_PCaRvZ9j1rW1fMC2x88FRlvI/edit,No,"You don’t like the girl you’re with?
You think lust for another is acceptable?
You don’t care who you hurt by looking?
You think it’s acceptable to look as long as you don’t touch?
None of these seems to be good enough reasons to disrespect the one you’re with, does it, or even take the chance of losing the one you’re with over it! Have you ever stopped to think of how that makes your wife/girlfriend feel by your actions? The fact is, the damage could be irreversible!
So what are the side effects of your “wandering eyes”?
Betrayal? (perhaps)
Lust?
Suspicion?
Broken trust?
Disloyalty?
Feeling unwanted?
Used?
Disrespect?
Anger?
Is it a sin to look? Of course not! It is a matter of the heart, if you have sin in your hearts, you will have sin in your eyes!
If you look upon a person in a lustful way as was the person talked about at the beginning of this writing who was stopping to do a double-take at the girl passing by then mouthing a gesture as if saying “ooh”, then yes, his heart was not right and had sin in it. He not only disrespected the girl walking by but he disrespected the girl he was with!
In Matthew 5:29 it says “if the eye offends, do pluck it out”. This is not saying to literally pluck a sinful eye out but, first, the eyes can sin by what they see in lust; second, that the sinful eye could cause you to not enter into the Kingdom of God!
When you are with someone in a relationship, don’t be led away by evil thoughts of lust, let your thoughts be pure, and your eyes focused on the one you’re with!
In 1 Peter 1:22, it says “purify your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, to love one another deeply from the heart”. You must remember, relationships are built on trust and when you break that trust by allowing your wandering eye to lust, it exposes what is really to blame, your heart!
By your inappropriate actions of lust, your heart displayed your desires, which leads your partner to feel unappreciated and unwanted. How? If you were truly satisfied with your partner, you would not want to look up on anyone else in lust!
Can you imagine how your partner would feel if they saw you drooling over another person? I can tell you they would be heartbroken and devastated. You have destroyed a relationship that was supposed to be built on trust and placed it in uncertainty!
My point is this, if your heart is not right, it could cause the things you see to be in a sinful way and without saying a word, it could affect the person you may be with!
Be true to yourself and the one you’re with!"

I pulled the door shut and followed her like I was in La-La Land.
She said, “babe you didn’t lock the door.”
She has a way of making me forget my name sometimes. I walked back up the sidewalk, locked the door, and snapped a “white rose” from our rose bush. She smiled as I walked towards her with it. I leaned in towards her with it and she leaned towards me. I slid the rose in her hair beside her left ear. I opened her door and grabbed her hand as she sat softly. Walked around, got in and drove off.
We arrived at WES (where everyone smiles) before schedule so we could get our usual seats. She didn't know that I had paid in advance for us to get front row seats. The same table as our first night. I pull out her chair and waved for the water (Steve). He knows our usual so he doesn’t walk over, he just brings our drinks within minutes. I sat down and watched her smile. I’ve always placed her between me and the stage so I can watch them both at the same time. If she knew why I placed her chair there after all this time, she’d just smile even bigger.
Tonight we got a surprise even though we go to WES twice a month. I wrote 2 poems that would be read back to back… “Falling in love” and “Every second.” As our drinks arrived, I asked her to stand for a dance.
“No one is dancing, they’re all listening to the host,” she replied.
“I know, that’s exactly why I want you to stand.”
“Couples, we have a special couple in the house tonight.” There’s a woman with a white rose behind her ear… “these words are for you.”
“Baby, what is... “
“Shh..”
Falling in love
If you're not ready for this tell me.
I may be going overboard and it’s early on so this is maybe one sided
This is how I feel.
Every second
Even when I sleep you cloud my mind like I am surrounded by fog
You take away my breathe like the winter frost
You hypnotize me like a swinging chain
You keep me on my toes like I’m on edge
You make my heart beat fast like a winded runner
You make me want to say “I Love You” every second, like a scratched record.
As she remained speechless, I spoke up.
“I don’t come here for the drinks. I don’t come here for the entertainment. I come here because you like to come here. This night would still be special without none of this as long as I have you. It is only you that makes this night and every second special for me .
Thanks for the wonderful night.”"

Our next to the oldest brother, along with his friends would pull them to make her cry. This would bring me running to her aid. Nobody messed with my sister. Not even our brother.
We have been close all our lives. When she had to raise her three daughters, I was there by her side. I was an uncle and a part-time dad to the three.
All she (my sister) had to do was ask and I would be there to help. Even if it was to cut grass or babysit her children. Of course, mom and dad were there to help too. All mothers need a break.
I could remember coming home from school and could tell someone had been baking. The smell of fresh chocolate filled the air. To me, it made my mouth start to water.
My sister had motioned for me to open the refrigerator and there sat a white porcelain plate, a mound of devil food cakes, chilled to perfection. If you know me as I do, I just had to try one or three.
This is what sisters do for their brothers. I will tell you, no store-bought cake tasted anywhere close to the one made with love. It is always great with a glass of mom’s tea.
When my sister was young before I was born, she was sick and had colitis and most small-town doctors in the fifties didn’t have a proper understanding of how something like this would drain the life out of a person.
Most people don’t get it in life. When you have one sister or none how important of a part she plays in one’s life. She is very precious to me. Once she is heaven bound, I can and will, reflect how wonderful I had a chance to share my life with her.
I would advise anyone young and old who has a sister to hug them and truly let them know what they mean to you. Take them out to eat and surprise them with a special gift.
The best gift I have ever received growing up is my sister. That is the reason “I love her”."

The crunch of most gravel under rolling tires. An old Italian man heading into the bodega and exiting with coffee steadied in hand and the Times folded and pinned underarm. She would watch him. She would playout fictional scenarios of what laid ahead for him: an early morning mistress who loved the Sunday crossword but hated coffee, she tolerated his drinking of it, and so on, until he was down the pavement and out of sight.
The sudden chill brought her out of her reverie. Exhausted from her wandering, and wondering, she headed home. Dog-walkers, taxi cabs, joggers, the working men; the puddles had dried; the streets were teeming with movement, with noise, with smell.
Up the staircase she went. In front of the door she fumbled for the keys. She opened the door slowly, expectantly. The non-descript couch in the common room and the faded water stained, oak dining table with unmatching chairs in the kitchenette were her only guests.
Down the hall she went. The smell of old carpet was heavy on her nose, she had not vacuumed in weeks. She entered the bathroom intent on a wash. Off came the leggings, off came the jorts, the panties, the wristlets, the blouse, the bra; off came the nonessentials. Along with the wig.
She stood in front of the mirror observing; small breasts with dark protruding nipples, flat undefined stomach whose navel was allotted with a thin patch of dark pubic hair aligning with her pelvis. Slowly her arms lifted from waists length and her fingers traced the underneath of her breasts. The feeling of the firm mass present in her left breast was unsettling but not unfamiliar. She worked her hands up onto the baldness of her head.
Tears fell down her cheeks, down the valley of her breasts and came to puddle in her pubic hair. As the rain, this to would dry. This to would pass with time.
She thought of the working men; the butcher, the garbage hauler, and so on...She thought of the sun; rising-falling-rising-falling...She thought of the clouds, of the rain, of Sundays. Eternal play of day.
She thought of the old man, making his way to his mistress. His ascent up the stairs was a balancing act; the Times and the coffee were to precious to go tumbling down. She thought of the mistress, standing in the doorway eager to greet him, to love him.
And somewhere deep down in the subconscious; beneath the skull, beneath the brain tissue; resided an unanswered scenario: does his mistress wear a wig?"

Do not allow your mind to focus on anger, but calm-prove yourself the strongest when you show complete control over your emotions and body language.
I will not advocate complete passivity. If you are attached physical before any words are exchanged, definitely defend yourself. But stay calm-use only enough force to defend. Do not exceed the violence your opponent expels. To do so will prolong a escalating confrontation here you both are jailed, hospitalized. By defense with only sufficient force to stop the attack-your opponent will quickly time of the conflict-and move on to a easier victim
I’m not King Solomon, but I’m well-read-ad well studied in conflicts. 23 years of prison, plus 20 years in a poverty sticker, crime riddled childhood neighborhood. I listen to older adults counted as a child-then watch, learn, listen- I quickly became a moderator of disputes by age 7 or 8, still am today.

Twice a week, if the permits and the staff can’t think of another excuse, we can spend 75 minutes in a kennel and see the sky, smell the air, and admire the uniformity of the lethal electric fence that surrounds us. Sometimes there’s a sane-ish guy out there whom I can converse with, if the others out there aren’t shouting too loud.
It’s hard to be thankful when the people we might have and who might care about us can only visit us through the TV monitor that’s about 18 inches and sits eight feet away from us on the other side of armored glass. We must speak with them over an intercom system that usually only relays two out of every three words, but often doesn’t work at all. Most visitors stop coming…
Should we be thankful that the neo-lib Judge Barbara Crabb appointed her comrade Ed Garvey (prior Dem candidate for governor) to represent us on a class action suit challenging these conditions? Should we appreciate that his firm was paid nearly a million dollars to force a settlement on us despite over 90% of us objecting?
Can we be thankful that they no longer keep mentally ill prisoners here, in solitary/restrictive housing? Well I knew a handful of strong men who decided that severely lacerating themselves was less painful than spending more years here. I’ve seen others declared sane and kept here, despite spending months in suicide observation status or living in piss, shit soaked cells, unable to communicate with anyone. I’ve seen these men try to kill themselves in various ways at any opportunity, some of whom are currently diagnosed as schizophrenic and bipolar.
Staff sometimes ask me, “How are you doing?” They genuinely sound sincere. It amazes me how oblivious they are to their role in crimes against humanity.
I don’t want to not be thankful, yet it is impossible for me to be given the society that I live in that tolerates this. (I am thankful for PE staff, volunteers and people like you). I understand that not being thankful makes my company less desirable, but I am unable to fake it. I am unable to “stand for the anthem.”"

Sometimes these matches last long beyond the prison experience. Now you can marry whomever you want including the inmate of your choice. Of course you can’t work here after the marriage. Most couples wait until the End of the Road. In a touching scene worthy of the most torrid romance novel scenes, the inmate is decanted from the prison into the waiting arms of the non-inmate partner. But it’s probably a good idea not to try and place your bachelor(ette)’s phone number on you approved phone list or to list their residence as your future residence when filling out paperwork with your classification officer.
Why Does the Mona Lisa Smile? - So there you are in the Louvre waiting to see the most famous of all famous portraits. You stand in an endless line sometimes for years. While you are waiting, you actually forget what the Mona Lisa looks like. You question yourself. When was the last time I saw her? Will you recognize this portrait when you see it again? You try and gauge how long the line is until the two people in front of you spring apart unexpectedly, like when you innocently open a cell door to deliver clean laundry and two parties unexpectedly pull apart and face you. And there it is. Obviously a masterpiece, each detail stunningly correct. Except. Except. Why is it so small? This is what I’ve been waiting for? And the Mona Lisa smiles as if to say “gotcha!”.
Tennis - This game is played in singles at all hours in many locations: cells, the shower, the actual tennis court, and the recreation yard in front of dozens of interested observers. Rather pedestrian in terms of the other exotic sporting opportunities. If you are caught making unauthorized physical contact, you may be forced to the penalty box and given a time out for 60 days and end up with a 9/7 report in your jacket.
Auditioning the Finger Puppets at Midnight - Don’t like team sports? Afraid of the many unpleasant diseases that are spread in the protectionless environment of Prisoney Land? There are more solitary pursuits. You too can be the director interviewing the star or starlet of your choice in your own private director’s couch. Best to do this late at night and at timed intervals when non-inmates are making their rounds and checking their rosters twice to find out who is naughty and who is nice. Develop excellent hearing. Unfortunately, you may be charged with a sexual violation - a 9/7 disciplinary report for unauthorized sexual contact with yourself. The penalty flag will be thrown and you’ll be in the SHU for 60 days. Fortunately, there are so many players of tennis that you won’t spend the full time out in the corner.

At the nursery this scent was masked by surrounding selections. This is the only healthy plant I ever removed from my garden and destroyed. As a consequence of differences in soil composition and climate, my old favorites for summer color had to be abandoned. Thankfully, the roses would bloom nearly year round.
The vegetable patch proved best suited for melons (cantaloupe and honeydew), carrots, radishes, and zucchini squash. Although short-lived, the zucchini blossom is among the largest and most intriguing flowers to behold.
Life changes – new wife, two stepsons, and arrival of two infants – altered my priorities thereby limiting my time for tending the gardens (the children were a worthy replacement!).

My threatening to throw you in an oven and burn you in a horrible, fiery death, and your telling me good luck because it will take a while to pre-heat.
I closed my eyes and heard the sound of your voice. The wind blew, and I felt the touch of your hair against my face. I thought about you from the moment I woke until the moment I slept.
You were there through the hard times. You lifted me through the pain and the hurt and the loneliness. You were my strength, and I was your loyal bandman.
I looked in the mirror and saw your eyes reflected back at me. That small smile when you were happy--that smile that seemed to say, I know you love me. I love you too, but I’ll never tell. That look on your face when you were worried about me--the look that let me know you would protect me from every harm.
A fire burned inside me as I thought about the day I told you I had to leave. You didn’t understand that it wasn’t your fault. I didn’t know how to tell you how damaged I was. That I had lost the ability to love. That I had been through every hell imaginable and had nothing left to give.
I didn’t know how I would explain to you that you were the only thing on my mind from that day to this one. Didn’t know how I would explain that all I wanted to do was brush your hair behind your ears and see your face. To have you lay your head on my shoulder. To hold you. To kiss you. To feel you.

So I ran. Through rain and puddles and traffic. I ran until my muscles burned and my body ached. I ran until my heart beated hard enough to tear a hole in the universe. I ran until my body shuddered and my soul cried out for mercy.
Then I ran some more.
When I rounded the corner, you were there. I stopped, not sure what to do next. You were standing in the rain with the umbrella creating a halo of untouched space in a world washed away. You were as beautiful as I remembered. More than I remembered. Your dark hair blowing gently with the breeze. Your eyes bright. That small smile on your face.
I wish I had realized at the time. I would have walked away. I would have gone before you saw me. Before you slowly turned your head and our eyes met across the time and distance that had separated us for so long.
Your eyes told the story. Hiding your emotions was always easy for you, but your eyes give it all away. At that moment I knew that smile on your face wasn’t for me.
I was soaked to the bone and nearly hypothermic. The cold didn’t make me shiver; it was the concerned look in your eyes. The one that told me you knew how much I was hurting. The one that let me know that all you wanted to do was run to me, hold me, and protect me.
As the rain ran down my face, and my fingers turned to ice, I knew I had made another mistake. I had complicated your life again, but this time I had a chance to stop it before it went too far. This time I had a chance to make it right.
I like to think that in that moment, our eyes said everything we never could to each other. I like to think that you heard me say the words I love you even though I never did. That you knew that I thought you were the best person I had ever met in my life. That all I ever wanted was to see you smile. That I wanted nothing more than for you to be happy, even if that wasn’t with me. That’s why, when he came down the driveway, put his hand on your face and kissed you, all I could do was offer you a small smile of my own as I walked away.
Those sixteen blocks back were the longest walk of my life. I wanted to hold onto your face. I wanted to remember the way you looked then, but I couldn’t. It became distorted and hazy, blown away by the new pain that crept into my being. The pain and the hurt and the heartache: the only things left that I could feel.
I passed the Chinese place. The ice cream stand where the cone melted down my arm in the 95 degree heat that one summer day, making you laugh harder than I’ve ever heard you laugh before. The park where we would lay in the grass and you would ask me any crazy question that popped into your head. The flower shop where I bought you the bouquet after you graduated. The candy store where I bought you the chocolate you love and left it on your pillow on Valentine’s Day.
Memories everywhere. Everything. All around me. Invading every sense, every corner of my mind. But the only thing I wanted to remember was you.
I made it home and stood in front of the door. I was numb. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I felt the weight of the water coming down on my face. I looked to the sky for answers. I demanded them from God, from the universe, from someone, from anyone. I stood and let the rain wash over me, the world’s tears mingled with mine.
The next day the rain still fell. The world outside and my world inside were still broken. I cleaned up, dressed, and ate mechanically, without feeling, without care. I grabbed my bag and an umbrella and headed for the door.
As I stepped out onto the sidewalk, I popped open the umbrella. The halo of unwashed space surrounded me. I closed my eyes and took a breath, letting the rain wash away everything I couldn’t seem to let go of. I turned down the street and started to go.
That’s when I saw you standing in the rain."

Somewhere out there was my truest friend, a sister to watch cartoons with, to ride bikes with, poke at bugs with, go to the library with, get into mischief with… We’d roam the world together, me and Blood Sister. I had as many fantasies about Blood Sister as Linda had about Ghost Sister.
Yet as I grew up, my fantasies of course never manifested, and I never bothered to find my birth/blood family, so Blood Sister faded from my daily life - though never completely. From time to time I’d still imagine what she might be like, what she would do for a living, her hobbies, and so on. We “lost touch” in a way, but not completely.
At 26 I had become close to my cousin, who turned out to also have been adopted (so my adopto-mom and her adopto-dad were brother and sister), and had found the process of meeting her blood relatives to be deeply meaningful and important and cathartic. She offered to do all the detective work for me, and I just said “sure, that’s cool - knock yourself out,” thinking it’d be nice to find my birth mother and family, but not too concerned. “No big deal.”
When my cousin told me, just the next day, that she’d spoken to my grandfather, and that my mother wanted to meet, my whole shifted. Suddenly it mattered, deeply, that I find out who these people are. The idea of simply going to a park the next day and seeing my actual blood mother… it took my breath away….
And when she said “and you have a sister, too!”... suddenly my breath came back. Like I hadn’t been breathing right my whole life until that moment. Blood Sister was real.
I have a knack for being complicated . Everything about me takes … explaining. My name, my education, my past, even my birth dates (dates plural). One of those complicated parts is my family. I was born in Upstate New York, but raised in Salt Lake City, Utah (kind of) and now I have double the normal relatives, like parents, grandparents, etc, as well as a Ghost Sister and a Blood Sister.
I don’t resent Ghost Sister (maybe Linda a bit), but I also can’t be entirely free of her - she was an all-permeating part of my childhood, Fortunately, I now have Blood Sister, who is my closest friend, my dearest ally. And when I finally get released, we’ll be eating sugary cereal while we watch old cartoons and then ride our bikes to go look for cool bugs. The love we have for each other isn’t diminished for our years apart, and she’s not “half” anything to me: Blood Sister is more than any of my youthful daydreams ever imagined."

After I was ten steps beyond the fire I knelt down, made kisses at him, and offered the meal on my fingertips.
But now he faced me head on with a curious, but, hungry, look in his eyes. I sat still with meat on my fingers as he slowly walked to me.
He came up slowly, cautiously, sniffing the air. He slowly came right up to me, and gently took the squirrel meat from my hand. I knew then he was domesticated, and wondered if his owner was near, or if he was lost.
After he wolfed down the meat he just looked at me. I carefully put my hand back out to him keeping it just under his head as a sign of peace. He stretched out his nose and sniffed me. Then he licked my hand, and put his head under it indicating that we were cool, and the petting could commence.
As I petted him a voice like water falling on crystal said “Blackie! There you are. Are you mooching from him?” I looked up, and saw an angel in white. She was drop dead gorgeous. Long brown hair cascaded from under a white knit cap down past her shoulders with her ear tops playing peekaboo through her hair. She was about five-two or three with long legs and a slender, curvy figure. I mean more curves than the California Coastal Highway. She wore a white jacket and pants that matched. Her clothes set off the green of her eyes perfectly. Her smile was perfect showing off the whitest teeth I’d ever seen. Just seeing her made me feel just shy of ugly.
I said “No, he’s not a mooch, just friendly.”
Her laugh was like tinkling glass, her smile getting even bigger, and crinkling around her sparking eyes.
“He’s good at that” she replied. “My names Jo Beth, and this rascal is Blackie.” She said this as she came up, and wrapped her arms around him in a big hug. She looked right into my eyes, and I was trapped by the emeralds in hers.
“I’ve got squirrel cookin’ if you two care to join me.” I said “Oh! Pardon my rudeness, my name is Gerald.”
Again she laughed, and my heart melted. “You’re not rude, you’re very kind. You made friends with Blackie, and that makes you good in my book,” she said.
Needless to say they did join me for dinner. We talked like we had known each other all our lives, easy and free. The conversation just flowed like a swift moving stream. We’ve been married for three months now, and Blackie and I are the best of friends. Especially when we added Misty to our family. We’re expecting puppies next month, and our first child in eight-and-a-half!"

The railroad timber under my feet cracked and broken reminds me of the hard times.

The idea, the thoughts come and go as I stay walking my track.

Tariq Trotter, upholding the discipline and the dream
I don’t pack verses
Never sacrifice the team…
An army of I-frienemies I don’t tolerate
Who can master, “Cowboy” the Great?
Upside down, on my Zeppelin trip!
While, minds and hearts… are full of hate
Junkie-assault on bodies
Buried-alive, addicted to misery and strife
What do I care? Where their sense of ambitions and politics is… Tampons,
And weak-minded jock-boys
Kinda like a Chili Peppers cover, where men are wearing cock-toys
Something like, sock joy… Prisoner’s in a riot
Miss me with the fan fare
I don’t sell out, that easy
And while you’re 2-facing me, remember
How everybody else’s fingers was greasy
With hearts like, chicken tenders
I’m still not eatin’ chicken
Or sleazy
Life of hard spots, patiently waiting to taste, K-Breezy…
With an army like I got
My mind makes gravity easy
One diploma, in each hand
All those frenemies beneath me…
So…
Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Why you tryin’ to bring me down…
Pretty horse, major chords and a loping beat
Best mechanisms
Precisely placed for the street
This is my anthem - as wild as the mercury sounds
Temperature’s rising; no, I don’t back down
I’m on the way to the clouds… Ancestral, burying mound
White Zeppelin and a dark horse… Such a , deeply embattled romance
Softly searching for small signs
Gently thinking: What’s left
This is, just
A few syllables - a marking of the time for the state of mind that I’m in…
Most have, loose screws… Rattlin’ like a spaghetti strainer
I gotta get a new crew
They’re, all scrambled (like fried eggs)
I got
Production on a two-fifteen
Planned-platinum
Your girl’s mouth, is my studio
I’m comin’ on the track
I told you, don’t bust shots
This, my balloon!
I bust back…
So…
Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Why you tryin’ to bring me down…
Ta-Ban, a-wake
Taliban, none ain’t!
Don’t want this isolation but what’s a King to do?
I got the game, checkmated
Your, sabotage? - it’s outdated:
You’re something like a Beastie Boy, hanging around Paul’s Boutique…
As, all the ladies screaming - “Huh! - Cowboy! - Look up there!”
Letting y’all know
Get a new lease
Slay ire-fiends while I sleep
With a, brief inquiry into on-line relations: Is that the phone you’re fuckin’, or Selfie faces?
Because to a Don like me, it’s just rearranged places
Something like prison - a bunch of mental-health cases
Another time…
Another place…
Another life… Another case
So…
Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Why you tryin’ to… bring me, down..."

Highly perceptive. Sometimes when you’re trying to enjoy a nice dinner with the family, Tutti will sit in the corner of the dining room and stare at you with such sagacity, you’ll swear he understands; like maybe he’s the only one who will ever truly understand you...Not how Gunderson thinks he understands geese. I’ve actually seen him dress that goose in a cloth diaper with safety pins and push it around the neighborhood in a tiny stroller. Talks to it like a child too. Gunderson is a moron, but you can’t tell a goose that.
Tutti is also a great emotional support dog. When Janice and I were going through a rough patch in our marriage, Tutti was her comfort and constant companion. Janice somehow got the notion I was having an affair with a fresh young intern at the office. Not true. By the time I convinced her I had not stepped outside our vows, Janice and I were both physically and emotionally drained. Stayed up late that night making love, embracing and weeping with promises of external fidelity.
The next morning Janice had a glow that I hadn’t seen since our honeymoon. She fixed a pot of coffee and when she went to check the mail and found a pair of white cotton panties next to a dead bluejay on the porch. Janice left me. Took the kids. To top it off, got into it with idiot Gunderson come over after Janice left hooting and hollering that Tutti was in his yard and as a result his goose now suffers a broken leg. Lies. We almost came to blows in the middle of the street!
Did I mention Tutti also responds to several basic commands such as sit, stay, fetch, and heel? Good because I think Janice is having an affair with GUnderson. I can’t prove it, but I can feel it.
Sometimes I still see her driving around the neighborhood. IF she’s not coming to visit me, then who? WHO?
This morning a marshal came to my door with a subpoena. Gunderson is taking me to court. Suing me for vet bills, emotional distress, and his goose ran away so I guess that’s my fault too!
Son-of-a-bitch claims to have evidence of Tutti entering his yard on the sly and driving that bird off in that creepy baby-doll stroller. Ha! Crackpot!
Hope Tutti did take the goose. Who knows, maybe he did.
Perhaps Tutti had a plan all along; to ruin Janice and my marriage and to get to Gunderson’s goose by driving Janice into his arms. Who else left those pantieso n the porce? And next to a dead bird of all things?
Could Tutti not even be a dog at all, but a fox who has outfoxed us all. So, if you are interested in giving -- whatever in the hell he is -- a good home, please contact the number below.

Surprise, surprise - the court denied my appeal, misstating the facts to justify it. State v. Lindell, 617 N.W.2d 500 (Ct. App. 2000). The decision was big news in the state, especially in my hometown; it was expected to go to the state’s Supreme Court.
Abby went silent - no mail from her for several weeks, a month, two months. Worried that she might’ve Julieted on me, I called her home. That’s when I found out how she’d been diagnosed with depression, prescribed enough psych. meds, didn’t go out with friends, refused offers to date, and that those good folks at church had blamed her for my falling away from church (of course it had nothing to do with those nuts trying to cast the devil out of a schizophrenic lady they picked up from a home for the mentally disabled, nor the cold shoulder the leadership gave me because I went to college, etc.) and killing someone, while her parents harassed her for being “too close” to me (apparently they didn’t know she was engaged to marry me.
Judging by the guilt trip she laid on me, Abby’s mom laid a whale of a one on Abby, maybe enough for her to need psych meds?
See now how Siegel’s theory about interpersonal relationships is relevant to this story?
I promised Abby’s parents that if Abby wrote and told me that she no longer wished to communicate, I’d respect that.
Three weeks later, such a letter arrived. In it, Abby rationalized parting ways by saying I’d betrayed my family, a real nut shot given the truth was the opposite. I guess she had to see me as bad so she wouldn’t feel like she was doing me wrong - I’d rather she found a tolerable man out there and remained friends.
Twas a scratch, just a scratch. Life went on; I prepared for the WI Supreme Court.
Until then, I’d sidestepped the nitwits around me who occasionally tempted me to whoop their ass with their sloppy conduct. I didn’t want to hurt Abby, look bad in her eyes. Then, sadly timed, some black dude with faulty biases about white people decided to spit on me (it’s a longer story…), which I was ready for. It was in the law library, and I chucked the law book I’d been holding, stuck him a couple times with the steel pen I’d been holding for that purpose. By the time it was over, all he’d managed to do was bleed all over me and the law library, and bite my stomach while I smothered him and wrapped his limbs up.
Not bragging about wrecking that fool, although he brought it upon himself. But, I’m sure I’m not the first prisoner who was restrained by loving relationships from going Hellraiser on someone. Not that Abby should feel guilty about that, the system however, should feel guilty."

I’ve gained a variety of knowledge of training disciplines like: Tabata, Hiit, Tae-Bo, Crossfit, Pilates, and Yoga.
Learning about these different styles and forms of fitness has helped guide me onto a path of physical, mental, and spiritual recovery. It comes with a certain level of comradeship with some of the other guys also into fitness. It allows me to bounce off ideas and gain a better understanding of various workouts, improving my own personal growth and development.
Yoga led me more into the spiritual development and mindfulness aspect of life, as I dived into: meditation, prayer, Asanas (stretches), Pranayama (vital breath), relaxation. Yes, I am actually trying to learn how to relax. I’ve learned Yoga is not only good for warm-ups before a workout and cool downs after, but it also introduced me to a whole new philosophy and practice of mindfulness. There is so much to the world of Yoga.
This, as I’ve said, helped me get into spiritual development to supplement my gains in the physical. Now as I continue to practice physical and spiritual regeneracy, I feel my mind is calmed a bit, I’m building strength and endurance and getting in better shape. I am making small gains towards a healthier, happier me.
“Fall in love with the process and the results will come,” said one of the IIBB pros. But it is only through constant, continual practice of mindfulness (my spiritual exercises) and workouts like Tabata and Hiit (my physical exercises) that I grow or get anything out of it. I have lost nearly 40 lbs since I began this journey and I’ve chiseled and toned down to next to no fat on my body. Plus, I’ve gained some muscle mass and I can just about run a 10K comfortably. It has taken commitment, dedication, discipline, and hard work to change my body and improve my overall health: mentally, emotionally, physically.
Therefore, my body-mind, body-spirit, is now being transformed into a new creation, thanks in part to my physical and spiritual exercise. Almost like when a caterpillar builds its cocoon and it becomes transformed into a butterfly. I am building my cocoon (so-to-speak) as I daily practice physical and spiritual exercise, so that in the end result I would become transformed by the renewing of my mind into a healthier, better me. It’s about healthy living for me now. I feel better and I rarely get sick, so I must be doing something right."

That inmost protest prevented me from doing some truly evil acts and from losing my soul and sanity to a perpetual torment because of those evil acts.
I’ve also experienced periods of times when I was being extremely lackadaisical in my approach to life but in listening to that inner-voice, I felt the need and calling to be better and to do better. Over the past two decades I’ve earned my GED, gotten various accredited certificates, job trades, and a sense of self-pride.
So when I think about the word “gratitude,” I must be thankful to my conscientiously prescient inner-voice for being inexorably present and guiding me away from a fate that would have led to my demise or plunged me headfirst into a bottomless abyss in which my sanity would’ve been forever forfeited.
Even though I’m in prison and have suffered innumerable hardships, I thank my inner-voice for giving me this opportunity to experience life through a profoundly moralistic lens and to be more appreciative of the countless blessings that God has bestowed upon us all."

Jenna’s brother was HOT, and I didn’t care that he was four years older than myself. I wanted so badly to switch our seats in the truck to be beside his farm boy, volunteer fireman body. She told him I lived just up the road and he said he’d drop me off after dropping her off, on his way to work.
Jenna jumped out of the cab after climbing over my legs. I said I’d see her at school, and we pulled away. Before his sister was even out of sight he said he’d heard things about me. I asked what he’d heard and he said “just things.” Then he was silent until we stopped at the stop sign just before my driveway.
“People used to say stuff about me, too,” he said. “Just didn’t bother me,” he finished as he pulled up out front.
“Maybe you should pick us up more” I told him.
For the next two months he only missed picking us up twice and each time, after dropping Jenna at their house we would make small talk, sometimes even taking a “detour” to continue the conversation. Then, one day Jenna said he’d had a fight, broke a fella’s nose and was gone. Left a short note, for her only, and split. I went through my senior year just wondering, what the hell.
One evening after studying for finals with Jenna, I was walking home when a beat up Chevy truck pulled up beside me. It was dusk and I got nervous; that is, until I heard the voice.
“Hey cheer girl,” he said and laughed as he opened the door just like he’d done that day at the school. I jumped in, giddy as could be and we drove to a secluded spot near the lazy river that flowed through the county. His hair was slightly longer and a thin beard accentuated and brought out his green eyes. Over a year of heartbreak and I was in love with him all over again.
“I’ve missed your blue eyes,” he told me, and in that moment I knew I had to have him stay.
I leaned over and kissed his mouth and never flinched as his hand found my flat stomach, my chest. I pulled away only to reposition for the seatbelt was digging into my back. The next morning I awoke in my own bed with no idea how I got there. There was a goodbye letter on my night stand. I cried for two days, no joke.
A tear rolled down my cheek when I found the letter in a shoebox with a bag of pictures from my senior year just the other day. All it said was, “Really sorry I can’t stick around. Always loved you.”
I’ve seen him twice since that night by the river. Once when Jenna graduated from college with a law degree and just last October at the Homecoming football game. We both have grown up and each have children, though not with each other as I one day thought, or dreamed, we would. I’ve been married three years now and he’s been married three times and struggles to pay support for five kids. He drinks a lot and has been arrested more than twice for fighting.
Sometimes when I look at my beautiful baby, I’ll think of all those nights he took me home and all those talks we had after cheer practice. Then, when my baby smiles I’m thankful that I was an inexperienced lover who tried to take control that night. I’d take the discomfort while sitting to a lifetime talking to him in a minute. Sometimes we’re just better off, I guess."

The scariest part is I went and bought a machete from Walmart. For what, I still don’t know. The day after, things came to a peak.
As I was laying down trying to sleep, I met the darkness directly. For some reason, I had lit a candle and put it on the dresser in the middle of the room. Once again, just watching myself.
Falling asleep didn’t feel like falling asleep. It felt like I was sinking to permanent darkness. It felt bad; worse than death. Lying there on that twin mattress in the dark, I was losing me.
Just when I had no more of myself to fight with, someone else fought for me. I said, “Jesus, help me”; nothing more. The candle light flickered and it felt like a weight jumped off me. I was shocked. I sat up and placed my feet on the floor. As I did so, I saw a black shadow slide into the floor vent at the edge of the mattress. Real or hallucinations?

Christmas? Nope. I can only eat so many peppermint candy canes. I can barely finished one small red and white striped cane. I don't think there's a special candy for Thanksgiving. I think Thanksgiving is reserved for cakes pies and cookies. Now Halloween has candy out the...,well let's just say there's a lot of Halloween candy. But it's all just smaller versions of your every day big candies. Nothing really special except for the white tipped orange cones known as candy corn. Valentine's Day? Heart shaped boxes of unidentifiable squares of filling stuffed chocolates. Ever open a box and find that your Valentine's Day sweetheart poked their finger into each chocolate square to see what was in the center?
But then there's Easter. My favorite candy holiday. I love jelly beans. Not the new style jelly beans that come and unusual flavors like bacon, pizza, and pickles. Not the fruit-flavored ones either. I love the good old-fashioned red, yellow, green, pink, black, and purple jelly beans. My favorite thing to do is to grab a handful of jellybeans and stuff them all in my mouth at once. The chocolate-covered cream-filled eggs and the chocolate eggs with the caramel and nuts center are my second most favorite candies. I also like the small chocolate and malted milk eggs that are wrapped in colorful foil. They always remind me of miniature footballs then there are the peeps. You know peeps. Those are the yellow sugar-loaded marshmallowy baby check looking candies. They taste like you popped a cup of sugar in your mouth. Once as an adult I ate so many peeps I got on a sugar high then got sick. And yes I'll even buy me a hollow chocolate bunny. Because, well, just what would Easter be if you didn't bite into the ear of a hollow chocolate bunny?
This motivates me to want to start a chocolate candy business specializing in holiday candies. Not just Christmas, Valentine's and other typical holidays that have candies. But all holidays. I'm going to make candy that when you open the wrapper take the candy out and bite into it you won't be disappointed. The chocolate won't be flimsy and it won't be hollow. Most of all it will taste like chocolate, not some bland artificial chocolate flavor. I'm going to make candy to celebrate all holidays. Labor Day candies representing different jobs. Memorial day candies to honor our fallen heroes. Fourth of July fireworks candy. But you know what I really want to make? Huge chocolate bunnies that are solid."

Three older gals are at the doctor for a cognitive reasoning test. The doctor says to the first woman, “What is three times three?”
“297” was her prompt reply.
“Umm hum” says the doctor. He then says to the second lady, “It’s your turn, now, what is three times three?”
She answers, “Friday”.

“Nine” she says.
“That’s wonderful!” Says the doc, “tell me how did you get that?”
She replies, “It’s simple--I just subtracted 297 from Friday!”.

The village blacksmith finally found an apprentice willing to work hard at low pay for long hours. The smithy immediately began his instructions to the lad, “When I take the shoe out of the fire, I’ll lay it on the anvil, and when I nod my head, you hit it with this hammer.”
The apprentice did just as he was told, and now he’s the village blacksmith.
A woman decided to have her portrait painted. She told the artist, “Paint me with diamond rings, a diamond necklace, emerald bracelets, a ruby broach, and a gold rolex.”

A grandfather bought a hobby horse by mail order as a birthday present for his granddaughter. The toy arrived in 189 pieces. The instructions said that it could be put together in an hour.

A statewide federal receivership was instituted over medical care. For several years medical care improved. Then as the federal courts eased up oversight - all that progress has unraveled.
Today, at my prison, they employ doctors who have zero ethics if human decency. Men who have severe health problems requiring lifetime, expansive medications are declared cured by these doctors. People are again dying.
When us legal beagles file to the federal receiver or class attorneys now we are told it’s merely a difference of medical opinion. That it does not rise to the unconstitutional level. How appalling. Our advocates have sold their souls to the prison industrial complex. Money has been spent to buy off those responsible for oversight. Lawyers for the inmates are a fiduciary duty to the prisoner/client. A duty to justice, humanity. Yet here we are back at square one. Once again, California’s prison industrial complex has thwarted justice and the constitution.
I hope a new generation of social justice advocates comes up soon to take the place of legal beagles like me. I’m close to parole, old, sick, broke down wheelchair bound. Yet I have no regrets. For I fought for what’s right! All that matters is to fight the good fight for what is right!

The planet earth? A fledgling couple of billion. Our planet is home to tens of thousands of varieties of life and human beings have placed us at the top of the food chain. We have become Gods amongst the beast, and yet our life expectancy barely warrants a blip on the cosmic radar of time. The earth is full of many lifeforms, both flora and fauna which outlive us “Gods.” My ego ask; why AM I here? What IS my purpose? Mankind has confidently created many deities in a vain attempt to justify our existence. We have built great temples and monuments to honor these gods all the while sacrfice both humans and animals to appease them. We have written God’s word for Him and followed these guidelines to feel close to Him.
“Thou shalt not kill.” What part of this commandment do we not understand? Since the horrific slaughter of children at the Sandy Hook elementary school there have been over 200 mass shootings in the United States alone! Human beings kill each other indiscriminately. So what should I hold onto, intelligent design or chaos theory? Have we been created in God’s own image or have we evolved from pond scum? Perhaps it is our actions which speak louder than words. . . A popular theory lately has been that perhaps God created the “Big Bang,” thus starting the evolutionary process. Alright then, I can live with that.
Imagine if you will that “The Source” (God) set off the big bang which set into motion 15 billion years of creation and then evolution. Maybe we were created in God’s own image; Well, eventually. . .And now presto, here we are!
In 2003 the “Human Genome Project” successfully sequenced and mapped out the entire human genome by unraveling our DNA. Are we now on the cusp of discovering God’s recipe for life? Perhaps. Sadly however this biggest question should not be “what is life,” but rather “what do I do with it?” Is the sole purpose of living and then dying to fulfill God’s will? Are we trudging through life simply to fulfill a prophecy? If you believe this I then also believe you may be a lunatic!
The bible says that “God is love.” It also instructs us to “love thy neighbor as we love ourselves.” Ah! Now that indeed sounds pretty straight forward. “All you need is love,” right John?
And now we have covered (or uncovered) a lot here. Cycling around full circle:
“When life gives you TIME make   ___,”
Personally I don’t give a piddle about “how” life started, but I do cherish that which was given, love of life. This has not always been the case. In fact, I have ashamedly squandered away most of my life. I would like to examine this a little with you. The following is a “life chart” which I have created. Today’s date is March 22, 2019 to keep everything in perspective.
My time alive thus far = 21,286 days
My time spent in prisons = 10,612 days
My time spent as a free man = 10,674 days
My time spent as an addict = 11,141 days
My time spent in sobriety = 10,145 days
I have been imprisoned for 50% of my life as an alcoholic/addict. Let’s now put that into perspective.
Average life expectancy
For white, US male, 76 years = 27,740 days
My time which has elapsed = 21,286 days
Approximate Time remaining = 6,454 days
Earliest possible release date
3-20-21 (minus) = -730 days

Possible time left in life to life as a free man = 5,724 days
When we do pass away, our tombstone reveals the year in which we are born and the year of our demise. These dates are separated by a small (-) dash. That dash signifies the time to which we have been given to spend over our lives. My dash should be represented by a squiggly line. The greatest human resource is not life itself; it is the “Time” in which we’re allotted. The true question should be: “what do we do with our precious time?” For 10,612 of my days I have failed to use that time wisely. I should have been spending it loving all that there is to love, seeing all that there is to see, and hearing, smelling, feeling and tasting all that is out there to enjoy. Our time? Barely a blip on the cosmic clock.
How do you wish to spend your time? Getting high, drunk, envious, jealous, resentful, greedy, sad, lonely, angry, prideful, stubborn, sadistic, hurtful, regretful, mean, selfish, lustful, arrogant?
I have spent much of my time on these exact things. I have alienated myself from my family, my children, my friends and from society. Back in the 1970’s I can remember “Freddie Fender” singer: “Wasted days and wasted nights.” With this we can fill-in the rest of the theme question:
“When life give you time make ever second count!
Prologue
On March 14, 2019 I received a letter from a young lady whose name she with return address read only “L.” As it turned out “L” had questions about who her biological father was and did a DNA search. Voila! Turns out that I am he! Her letter broke my heart. “L” stated that she was afraid to write me in case I was to reject her. “L” also stated that she just wanted to know to whom she “belonged.” I wrote her a 25 page letter, sent a collection of family photos and a family tree dating back to the 1800s. I told her it is here, where you belong. I am anxiously awaiting her next letter. Wish us the best!"

It was an empty routine, spent mostly in a cramped cell. Because he didn’t get in trouble and stayed to himself, he had a cell to himself. As he sat in his cell, considering these new ideas, after 22 years in prison, he struggled to restrain the new, myriad emotions that washed over him like 400 volt waves of electricity. His skin roiled from the intensity of anxiety, fear, desperation… anger, which was blowing through the bones like a nuclear blast.
Is this what love is? He wondered, choking back a sob that struggled to tear its way out of his throat like one of Sigourney Weaver’s parasitic aliens. Thick tears oozed from his eyes which he didn’t bother to wipe away.
How the fuck did this happen? He wondered, knowing full well that he was never getting out of prison. He never considered seeking a “real” relationship with a woman. When he started writing to a woman who wrote him in response to a penpal ad, it was merely a way to pass time and maybe get some sexy letters.
He had been writing the woman for three years and bits at a time, like a flower opening, he thought, she’d opened herself up to him, telling him things she didn’t even tell the boyfriend she met at church. For example, she didn’t respect her boyfriend for his unmasculine behavior. Lawrence, not feeling anything, shared things about himself too, such as why he hated pedophiles. He told things he’s never told anyone, yet he felt safe telling her.
It was three days after Thanksgiving as he sat on his bunk trying to get a handle on his emotions. Earlier, he got a letter from her that told him that her lame boyfriend proposed and that she’d accepted, and so she couldn’t write him anymore.
She doesn’t even respect him! He thought in a fury. Why do I care?! He tried to convince himself and think coolly. But he knew he cared, and he realized why.
It’s a good thing I don’t have a cellie, he thought, imagining multiple cruel ways to dismember him. Anger quelled the pain, he realized, and the thought peeped up that maybe he’d used anger to dull such pain before, before he could even remember, which made him more sad.
Fuck! He thought. He’d never suffered from the regrets he had about the crimes he committed. But he was suffering now! He found out that the judge was wrong."

As the horror of what a major earthquake could bring sank into the minds of the inmates gathered around the TV, the minds of L.A. and Big Sam were already focusing on the aftermath.
“Hey, Man! What’s up?” came the cries of protest as L.A. stepped up and flipped the TV off. He calmly raised his hands. Amazingly, the protests ebbed to hear what he had to say.
“Look, guys, most of you know I’m from Los Angeles. I don’t know how many of you have ever lived through an earthquake, so let me tell you. There’s no fear like it. Those people out there have lost everything. They’re gonna need some help.”
“Help?” said one young inmate. “Hey, Dude, that’s what the government’s for.”
“Yeah,” spoke up another. “They got the Red Cross and stuff, that’ll help ‘em out.”
“Right,” still another said. “And we’re just a bunch of convicts. What can we do anyway?”
Not discouraged, L.A. listened to what everyone had to say, then he spoke. “Fellas, I’ll grant that we’re all prisoners who society feels have little to contribute, but this is an opportunity for us not only to prove such a belief wrong but also to give something of ourselves. To serve some ‘moral time,’” L.A. stated.
“Moral time?” asked one of the gathered inmates. “What are you talking about, L.A.?”
“What I’m talking about is doing something for someone else. Not because we have to but because we want to. Doing the right thing. Helping another person in need.”
“Just how do you plan for us to go about it?” asked Big Sam, his interest clearly reflected in the faces of about 30 fellow inmates who had been listening to the exchange.
“Well,” began L.A., “none of us has a lot of money.”
This statement was quickly met with nods and groans of agreement. The typical inmate in North Carolina earns an “incentive wage” of either 40 or 70 cents a day.
“But,” L.A. continued, “we can raise some money.”
L.A. and Big Sam put together a fundraising campaign that included the sale of donuts, pizza, and even a car wash where prison staff could get their automobiles washed and waxed. The entire prison, inmates and staff, were quickly galvanized into unity with the goal of raising money to provide some relief to the victims of San Francisco’s recent quake.
In just two months, a little more than $2000 was raised and sent to the San Francisco Earthquake Relief Fund. A sense of positive accomplishment prevailed over the prisoners who learned the pleasure of giving selflessly to others and the joy and peace it brings. Random acts of kindness replaced acts of violence as prisoners shared a common goal, working with prison staff to help the suffering thousands of miles away.
On the day that the check was placed in the mail, the warden had the kitchen serve a special breakfast to celebrate the achievement. As inmates sat down with the staff to share donuts, ham biscuits, and fresh fruit, everyone was reminded of the brotherhood of mankind. Such a brotherhood supersedes the superficial divisions of man from man, inmates from free citizens, one status from another status. We all learned that “service to humanity is the best work of life.”"

Bright flash, ringing… I woke up at Baylor Medical Center a week later with no recollection of how I got there. Still don’t know. And nobody seems to know either.
In my latest episode, my last wife absconded with my son (not his mother). Seems she liked the younger ones. She’d hatched a plan of using him to “off” me and cash in on my life insurance policy which she’d made herself the sole beneficiary of. To make a long story short, they came back the next morning and he stabbed me in the chest. A punctured lung. No BOOM! No bright flash or ringing in the ears, at least not yet. I made him pay for it before I blacked out. Later, at the hospital I faded or they put me under or I hit the end of another reality. Darkness. You decide.
BOOM! Bright flashes, ringing… I open my eyes to see a hard rain beating on a dark window. Thunder was still rolling when the nurse said,
“That thunder must’ve brought you back around.”
“No,” I said, “That thunder was me coming back.”
She didn’t get it. Some piece of medical equipment, undoubtedly keeping me alive, was ringing so the sound wasn’t just in my head. After I came out of ICU some cops questioned me about being stabbed but rather than tell them my son stabbed me, I told them nothing. The day I left the hospital, I was arrested for a gun I never had. Through a sick twist of fate for not telling on my son for stabbing me, I go to prison for crimes I never committed.
So here’s where things REALLY start getting weird. Court was a sham. In prison, civil rights are tramples, medical issues ignored, and people really do get treated worse than animals. And in here, people really do go to prison all the time for crimes they did not commit.
One hot night in a cell on a hard bunk, I dream a weird dream. A guard at the yard I was on, who always had his eyes on me, put me in a chain link holding cell called “cool off '' for a fight. I’m pacing in the heat and starting to rant while he stands watching me through the chain link.
“You feed me crap, violate my civil rights, lie to me, ignore my medical issues… what the hell, man?” I yelled and slammed the fence. “In what universe can you get stabbed in your own living room then go to jail for NOT talking to the police about it?
“This one,” he said, standing there impassively looking through squinty eyes. He stepped up to the wire, “You don’t know? You really don’t get it?” he asked.
“Know what?”
“You’re dead Jack. You died the morning he stabbed you. Or, at least, your body died. Your essence or being or soul-- whatever you call it-- never dies,” he said. “Well, no, wait-- that’s not true. Your son who stabbed you? He has been erased from the universe. THAT was the unpardonable act,” he said, unsheathing a baton.
“Wha-wait. Who are you? You’ve been eyeing me since I hit this yard and you look familiar as hell.”
“No one,” he said, eyeing me while he unlocked the gate. “But I’m always there when you have a close call. Your time is up,”
“Huh? Whatever-- let me outta this hellbox, then.”

“Holy shit,” Lenore thinks.
The girl blinked and her eyes were suddenly an ordinary blue. She blinked again and they seemed brown. Blink. Green.
Lenore’s legs folded neatly up under her and she found herself sitting on a patch of not-too-dry grass relatively close to the girl she’d been hoping to find.
The girl looked at her with now hazel colored eyes. The cigarette she is smoking smells spicy and pungent. Not cloves but something else, darker and richer. Lenore imagines this is what peat smoke would smell like if you mixed it with opium and a little patchouli. The slight breeze shifts and the wafting scent blows into Lenore’s face. She feels instantly light-headed and disoriented.
The girl smiles, inhales deeply and her eyes fill with the strange billowing smoke before settling into a dark hard yellow brown. Tiger’s eye.
“You have my necklace.” She says, her voice carries a soft sibilance, which makes the sentence sound like either a statement or quite a question. Regardless, Lenore plucks the ornament from her pocket and hands it over. She has a surreal feeling, yes, but more like all of this is scripted or being played out and she can only stumble through her small part uncomprehending of the larger play going on around her.
The girl deftly lifts the jewelry from her outstretched hand making it disappear into her own clothing in one fluid motion.
She sits up, drawing deeply from the cigarette. “A favor for a favor, Ellenore, what do you ask.” The girl says again her strange accent again turning the sentence into something off. Not a question, not a statement. She blows out a plume of grey white smoke, undeterminable punctuation.
Lenore tries to shake the feeling that seems to have overtaken and overwhelmed her.
“Who are you and what am I supposed to be doing with these pictures?” She asks finally forcing the words out through the haze of her confusion.
The girl drops the butt of the cigarette and grinds it beneath her shoe relentlessly until all that remains it a shredded filter saturated with a thick green tar.
She flashes a quick feral looking smile and her eyes go completely black from corner to corner and in their inky depths pinpricks of light glitter for a moment, starts dying in a breath before she blinks and they are gone, replaced by a mundane skyblue. “Margothea called me--,” she mutters something sibilant and liquid sounding in a language older than time. Then switches back to her accented english, “but you can cell me Delphi, I always liked that name simple as it was.”
“As for what you’re doing? Finding your destiny of course, just as Margothea--Margo to you--found her destiny her so must you find your destiny elsewhere. I’m guessing she left the pictures to help you, and that feathered fool,” she says while waving a negligent hand at the nearby trees which held, of course, the crow. A shrill caw of indignation followed this insult.
The girl stood up, ready to leave. “BUT, WHAT NOW?” Lenore asks before she can make her exit.
“Here’s a clue,” the girl says, eyes once more rolling smoke, “You’re in Southern California and the last picture is on water. GO WEST.” She finishes with disdain and strides off."

Rather, we’d see a beautiful but blurry pattern. It would have a shape but no edges. Einstein never saw Reality this way. He imagined that matter somehow distorted both space and time, not only where an object was, but across distance as well. He never understood that every particle is somewhere in the Universe. The Aether is real and composed of the chance of finding every single thing that exists.
How terribly our human perceptions skew our view of how the Universe really works! Our momentary glimpse of Reality blinds us to its true nature. Instead, we allow one man’s explanation to dominate the “scientific” community. Physicists spend billions of dollars looking for such things as black holes, dark matter, and evidence of the “Big Bang” when all they need to do is open their eyes and look at the flock of birds!
Imagine that your vision was so blurry that you could never see an individual bird. You would only see flocks and their large effects. The tiny, momentary effect of a single bird might look like something completely different, yet we would see that this strange effect, with no visible cause, was always stronger near what we could see. This is exactly how gravity works.
It is not enough to just see something. Everything we see is seen through the lens of our expectations. I once saw a giant sphere in the sky, and everyone around me thought it was a UFO. I knew what it really was: a flock of birds."

When I became old enough to have a family of my own, I made that a top priority. I tried very hard, and beat the odds to stay out of prison long enough to get married and to make a career out of working on houses. My mettle was tested when the housing market crashed in 208, but I had the tenacity to endure the recession while on felony probation, and kept a roof over our heads. All I have ever wanted was to be part of a happy family. I poured all of my heart and energy into making it happen. To my chagrin, my wife was cursed with endometriosis. It was easier and more cost-effective to obtain opiates from the neighbor than a doctor. Her condition went undiagnosed and untreated until the removal of her ovaries became requisite.
“ He’s got the whole world in his hands...”
I cannot express to you the depth of my desire with which I cling to, for teaching that song to my little girl or boy. I would love to teach my kids any number of things. Unfortunately I do not think that will be a possibility anytime in the foreseeable future. I am spending my thirties in prison. More likely than not, the progeny of my meth-induced revelries will be out in the world growing up, unbeknownst to me.
“ He’s got the whole world in his hands…”
I would love to partake in the American dream. Many people believe that’s a house and the proverbial white picket fence. The truth is, those things are secondary to the sound of children laughing in the yard. That’s where my pursuit of happiness would lead if the world really was “in his hands.” The moral of this story is this: That song is a farce. Also, so are you if you knowingly have children and it is within your power to be a parent, yet you choose not to be. You don’t have to be a GOOD parent, just as long as you are there. Our society needs more parents. More importantly, to every man or woman who is raising a child that is not of their own seed, you are deserving of the highest respect. Kudos.

You wake up and realize that you can hardly move in there. You’re constantly hitting the limits of your comfort zone. You see that you’re afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you have to stay on top of everything in order to be okay.
Why? There’s really no reason. You set these limits on yourself. If you don’t stay within them, you get scared, you feel hurt, and you feel threatened. That’s your cage. The wolf knows the limits of his cage when he hits the bars. You know the limits of your cage when the psyche starts to resist. Your bars are the outer boundary of your comfort zone.

For the poor child, it’s drugs, prison, or the death of the parents which causes the dysfunctional parenting to continue generation after generation. The rich child is just as likely to lose the presence of proper upbringing, only it’s due to total, callous, self-interest of the rich parent, which leads to absenteeism. Rich or poor, there is some outside influence that splits the family unit to pieces.
We look outside the borders of Western society, we see just as many children raised alone or by foster parents of some kind. It’s usually disease, poverty, war or death of some type that takes their parents. So they too shall continue this funeral dirge of dysfunctional generation after generation.
Nothing in this world matters when it comes to parents being responsible to teach right and wrong to their offspring. The religious and non-religious are also equally as abusive and absent. So why does the world of TV and politics try to claim there are normal, unified family units to aspire to be? It’s all a fallacy. Even our very first parents Adam and Eve were dysfunctional. After all, they were made homeless and cast out of Paradise when Eve listened to the serpent and lied to God. The lives of the first two children Abel and Cain ended abruptly when Cain murdered his brother Abel in a fit of jealous rage. I guess Adam and Eve were not ideal parents either. If you are an evolutionist--well parents then killed the defective disabled child or abandoned them to the elements because life was too harsh to care. Either the young child pulled their own weight at a young age or got thrown out of the tribe. Survival of the fittest, remember?
So my readers, why do we still lie to ourselves and think all parents should be good parents unless they are defective? In the real world, all parents, children, and human beings are flawed, defective. We can only strive to attempt to teach better skills to future generations. But so far, there has never been a typical, perfect parent, except on TV of the 1950s. That generation was lying to you too!
It’s sad, but true! “May God help us all!”"

Before he’d reach the town-o…
The goose prattled on and on. Even as vain and narcissistic as he was, he didn’t understand the humans’ sudden interest in him. He must have done something they considered quite heroic. All of a sudden, Farmer BRown started feeding him generous portions of his favorite foods!
He’d quickly gained three pounds! He felt guilty and tried to skip a meal. There were thousands of starving chicks in the world. If the humans had that much extra food, why didn’t they give some of it to Chicken Little or Turkey Lurkey?
He hadn’t meant to hurt anyone’s feelings, but he guessed he had. Farmer Brown ran a tube down his gullet and force fed him some kind of awful gruel. He wouldn’t make that mistake again.
He’d resumed eating and gained another four pounds. He didn’t feel good.    “Are my eyes yellow?” he asked. Brer Fox wasn’t listening, but he thought he heard an interrogatory inflection, so he dutifully nodded his head.
“Oh dear!” the poor, distraught bird moaned. “I hope there’s nothing wrong with my liver!”
“Oh silly goose, there’s nothing wrong with your liver at all!” Brer Fox mused. He thought of the pate de foie gras that he and the missus would enjoy that night, the kits gorging themselves on legs, drumsticks, and wings. On the morrow, there’d be breasts and stew meat, and he’d steal some fresh eggs from the henhouse. The missus would be very happy. And when Missus Fox was happy…
Pushing a baby buggy required a fox to be in a very undignified position. Brer Fox’s swelling member was almost in the old goose’s face. How awkward! He hummed a little louder and concentrated on a couple of verses of his own he’d been working on.
The goose ate corn and the fox drank liquor.
The goose got fatter, and they both got sicker.
He flapped his wings but he’d have to be quicker
To leave this farm alive-o.
‘Live-o, Live ooh!’
He flapped and flapped but he’d have to be quicker
To leave this town alive.
A bell rang. “We’d better turn around” the goose said. “Mrs. Brown is sounding the dinner bell”.
Brer Fox nodded absently. He knew where he was going...to a certain part of the fence behind the wooden shed.
Raging winds make candles flicker.
Rains came down and the roads got slicker.

And it wasn’t long before I began getting into trouble with the law.
I remember my first time being released from Juvenile detention center after having spent about a month. Mom drove to where Tati was staying with a friend. Tati didn’t know that I got out. Mom parked regularly, and got out when Tati and her friend approached from behind. I let them talk for about thirty seconds before opening the passenger-side door. I could hear Tati ask, “Who’s that?” Then a quick gasp as she realized it was me. She hurried over to me and hugged me really tight. The length of the hug was a testament to how much she truly missed me, and thought to her “Lil Bro” and despite myself, I remember realizing that my eyes were watering.
That was just one of many releases from juvenile detention centers to residential juvenile programs. As I think about all the times I seen her after not seeing her for a while, I recall how she gradually became more indifferent to my being released. The novelty was lost, after all.
From her perspective, it has to seem like her adolescence and young adult years were punctuated by my arrests and releases.
At the age of 19, I graduated to the adult system with a bunch of cases. For all the indifference I might’ve perceived her to have had, she cried harder than anyone else when I was sentenced to seventeen years.
That was seven years ago, and I haven’t seen her since (because of a combination of visitation suspensions, and how far they sent me from home.) I remember talking to her on the phone a couple of months ago - first time in years - and we marveled at how different we each sounded to the other.
And different she is: with a job making $700 a week, raising two kids on her own (and doing a hell of a job), being there for my mom. And, out of all things - Boxing classes! Gotta love sisters."

Everyday she trudged in bare feet to and from a well, carrying a bucket in each hand and balancing a third on her head. She trudged through narrow, winding, muddy paths, between the shacks and tents of low-caste Indians. She did this several times each day to get water that her family needed to wash clothes.
On her way, she would pass an old blind man who’d beg passerbys for food or money. She could clearly see each of his ribs, and his eyes were milky. The girl felt bad for him because nobody ever gave him anything, and sometimes people spat on or cursed at him.
One day, while on her way to the well, she saw an actual princess!
It was on a holy day. The princess was in a gilded, ornately decorated carriage, with velvet curtains, carried by a dozen large, strong men wearing fancy uniforms. Armed guards cleared her way as the beautifully dressed princess gently threw coins, candies, and other gifts from her carriage.
The girl looked at the princess in awe. Just then, the princess looked in the girl’s direction; their eyes met, and the princes felt pity for the girl. The princess called to one of her guards, gave him something, spoke to him, and pointed at the girl. The guard looked, nodded, and walked towards her.
“The Princess wants you to have this.” the guard said to the girl, then handed her a golden ring with a large ruby in it.
“Thank you!” the girl said bowing, her hands clasped in prayer. When she accepted the ring, it surprised her how heavy it was.
She’s never seen such an expensive piece of jewelry, and the most money she’d ever handled was a couple rupees she would use to buy soap or food. She, she had no understanding of the immense value of the ring relative to her family’s usual income; she only knew it was valuable. Happy about the gift, the young girl smiled as she went on her way to the well.
Soon she was approaching where the beggar sat. As she neared him, she saw and heard a tall man looming over the beggar. The tall man was shouting down to the beggar, “Why should I give you my money without you working for it? Here,” the tall man said, lifting up his foot, “Clean the bottom of my sandal with your tongue! Then I’ll give you a penny!”
For a moment, the girl was stunned by the cruelness she witnessed. Then, she dropped her buckets and ran up to them.
“Sir,” she said to the tall man, “I beg you, please don’t be so cruel to this man, who is obviously blind, starving, and old.”
“Ahhhrrr.” growled the tall man, looking back and forth at the girl and the beggar. Finally, he made up his mind, spat on the beggar, and stomped away.
The girl’s heart ached for what she saw, which was the miserable life of the old man.
“Thank you, child.” the beggar faintly said.
Wiping tears away, the girl looked at the ring she’d been given, then at the beggar. She handed him the ring. “What’s this?” the beggar asked excited, turning the ring in his hands, lifting it, feeling it.
“The princess gave it to me. Now, you won’t need to beg.” said the girl. Then she turned, beginning to walk away, sad about no longer having the ring, but glad that she helped the beggar.
“Wait my child,” said the beggar, “I have something for you.”
The girl stopped and turned back. “Yes?” she asked.
The beggar held out his gnarled, calloused hand. In it was what looked like a small, smooth, normal stone. “It’s a wishing stone.” he said, offering it to her. “If you hold it tight and wish for something hard enough, your wish will happen.” he said, smiling so broadly that she could see his toothless gums.
“Thank you,” she said, doubting him. She then turned and continued her journey to the well, realizing that her parents would be upset if she told them about the ring. So, she didn’t tell them.
Back at home, as night approached, she thought more and more about the beautiful princess, imagined how wonderful her must be- wearing the finest clothes, eating the finest foods, wearing expensive jewelry and perfumes. As she drifted off to sleep, she desperately gripped the stone, wishing that she were the princess.

When morning came, the girl rubbed her eyes as she woke up, looking around. She thought she was still asleep and dreaming, for she was in the royal palace, in the princesses bed, wearing a brightly colored silk nightgown, lying between fine cotton sheets, smelling the sweet odor of fresh-cut flowers, surrounded by luxuries she previously couldn’t imagine.
“I’m the princess!” she thought.
Soon, servant girls entered. They dressed her, perfumed her, and braided and decorated her hair with jewelry. She was taken to a large dining room and fed exquisitely prepared foods that, previously, she’d never imagined existed.
After eating, a servant girl informed her that her teacher would soon arrive. When he entered, smiling so all of his teeth gleamed, the Princess felt that she’d seen him before, when she was the washer girl. She closely examined him, then realized that he’d been the old, blind, starving beggar- looking healthy, well-dressed, with teeth made it difficult for her to recognize him.
“Sir?” she asked, stunned by the strange events.
“Yes, Princess?” he responded.
“Why- ? How- ?” she tried to ask.
“Ahhh, Princess,” he said, “now you understand.” He paused for a moment, looking at her. She remained silent. “You asked me what life was like for the lowest castes, what your life would be like if you had been born into a low caste, I gave you a ring, with a stone created by Ganesh, the Ruby of Understanding. Now you understand, don’t you?”
Frowning, she said, “Yes.. But I feel terrible knowing what their lives are like. You- you were there, an old man, a beggar, blind.”
“Hahahaha,” he softly laughed, smiling, knowing, pleased at her enlightenment. Maybe in a past life.”
Considering the life she’d lived as a washer girl, the princess was overwhelmed with pity for the lives lotted for the lower castes. “Have my carriage prepared.” she announced. “Our studies will have to wait.”
Still grinning, her teacher bowed, turned, and left.
The princess looked around. She gathered up her jewelry, her loose money, fancy combs and brushes, and all small, valuable items. She put them all in the trunk. “Gather all the sweets, pastries, and loaves of bread. Have them loaded onto my carriage.” she said to a servant girl.
An hour later she was in her carriage, being carried through the narrow winding, muddy streets in the poverty-stricken outskirts of the city. She gave the food and other items to those who seemed most in need.
Looking into the crowd, she saw a young washer girl, barefoot, carrying three buckets. Looking at her hand, the princess removed a large gold ring that had a large ruby set in it. She called to a guard, handed it to him, and said something to him while pointing to the girl.
The guard looked at the girl, nodded, then left."

We woke up early, and my wife had morning sickness for the only time, so I ran back and forth between the 2 kitchens for 6 hours, getting everything cooked and keeping everything warm. My mashed potatoes went to a whole new level that day, we introduced a Mexican friend to cranberry sauce, and the Koreans discovered just how seriously we Americans take our feast days.
This coming holiday season is a big question mark. I no longer work in the kitchen, so I won’t be too busy on those days. I no longer have any close friends to share the day with. I knew I will call my parents, the boys, and my significant other on those days. I will probably get a hard workout in, have a decent meal, walk the track for a while, and such. Time will tell.
My Thanksgiving in Afghanistan was fun. My friend’s wife sent him a box of non-perishable goods to make a complete meal. We got a bag of charcoal, fired up the grill, and made green bean casserole, instant mashed potatoes, turkey from a microwave dinner, and pies, rolls, the whole nine yards. Paled in comparison to the amazing lunch the dining hall provided, but nothing compares to spending time around a grill, under the stars with some close friends.
In the fall of 2022, I will get to enjoy the holidays with my children and family for the first time since 2009. That will become my most memorable holiday, but each one provides me with memories and uniqueness."

At least nobody would be coming out in such a downpour. A drip of water gently landed on the top of my head, and I looked up just in time for a second one to land on my left cheek--great. I inched the metal chair to the left to avoid the new discomfort and glanced at my watch again. Five minutes till four.
The rain suddenly stopped, and from somewhere to my left, an orange cat sprinted across the street. As it ran, I wondered how it seemed to avoid disturbing the puddles of water. I started thinking that the cat had the right idea and that I should leave. But then the cat went into the alcove I had been watching. Seriously?! Crap! How could I leave now? Was the cat a sign? Some sort of omen?
I looked up and down the street asking myself again why I even thought about coming out here. What if I did see her? Would I approach her? No. I couldn’t find the courage to ask her about what I’d been hearing. How could I find it to confront her here?
It started raining again. Not as hard as it was but a heavy drizzle; just enough to send hundreds of rain puddles into a frenzy of movement. I watched as the ripples collided with one another and wondered about the effects we each have on one another’s lives. Will we ever know to what degree we influence everyone around us? Every action we take, every decision we make, the ripples collide in so many unforeseen ways.
I was interrupted by my watch beeping, and I glanced at it to confirm that it was four o’clock. I looked up and had a fleeting hope that I wouldn’t see her after all. I was eager to accept that I had wasted my time and that all the stories were just lies. It was then that I realized that I really do love her. I was here to vindicate her: to prove to myself that I could trust her.
The orange cat appeared again and sat down just inside of where the rain was falling. It looked out at the rain as if it were a mighty king looking over his kingdom. Regal is the word for it; a sense of self-confidence and peaceful understanding. The cat and I seemed to look each other in the eye. He licked his whiskers as cats do, and I saw his ear twist back as if he heard something behind him.
Fear gripped me instantly. My belly flipped, and my whole body tensed as I heard the unmistakable sound of her laugh. The cat rolled his head back to see behind him, and I noticed I was holding my breath.
I forced myself to breathe and tried to convince myself that it wasn’t her laugh. It sounded like her laugh, but this laugh was more...happy.
I heard a door close, and then I saw her. As she knelt to scratch the cat on the head, I could see her smiling profile as she softly spoke to the cat. He was already lost in her touch, and as usual, I was captivated by just seeing her. But it occurred to me that I wasn’t captivated by her beauty anymore. I was looking at her in horror. All the stories about this apartment; all the lies about who I thought she was; all the promises and hopes and dreams that were shattered by her being there in that alcove.
Maybe it was that I suddenly stood up and the movement caught her eye. Or maybe she could just feel that the cat wasn’t the only one caught in her spell. Either way she turned her head and looked directly at me. As our eyes met, she stopped smiling and stood to her feet. She lifted her umbrella and opened it in one smooth motion. The rain dripped off the front edge as we looked one another in the eye. It was an eternal moment where I finally saw her for who she truly was. I saw the betrayal as she turned and walked away in the rain. I watched and wondered if she could see that I would never love again.
She disappeared into the rain, and the cat disappeared into the alcove."

They deny everything and refuse to slap her wrist, saying my complaint is “unsubstantiated” and therefore dismissed. I couldn’t make them agree that phony “security” body-grope searches are sometimes actually sexual molestation. Not even when the Kop tries to pin child molestation on you in a deliberate attempt to get you killed or maimed. I did this under the new Prison Rape Elimination Act. This is a law which captives are finally forced upon the Kops. It makes them pretend to investigate sex assaults. I tried to stretch it to cover Kops molesting helpless captives. So far, my tactic seems to have failed. Even so, GEO-Corp just got audited by “outsiders'' to check for compliance. I got to re-open the case.

Alexis Williams became my middle school sweetheart, and thanks to Terry, my haircut got her on the first day. I didn’t think she would like me due to my out of style fro, especially since our classmates followed the trend of low cuts with waves. By the middle of the school year, she eventually got tired of my standout look and asked me to cut it. She was overtly blushing when I took the initiative to do it for her, and while I was nervous of the new look, I got comfortable once I got the waves to spin like Jordan’s shot when the ball rolls around the rim and finally goes in. Since I adapted this new style, Ikea, the prettiest girl in the school, asked me out, but I stayed with Alexis. I was obsessed with her naturally long hair.
Aunt Doobie died in 2005 on Christmas Day, and so I got moved to a foster home in Philly. My new guardian was Lorraine who sent me to a local barber. Inside the barbershop, the barber was tipsy off a Corona. Like “I go to school high and get high scores,” I thought the beer would help him, but because of him, I went home inveigh. Lorraine looked at me like I was speaking Arabic. I ended up running away from that home because she became negligent to my needs. While on the run, I went to Terry who fixed my slanted hairline. After 3 weeks, my crooked hairline was saying, “It’s here to stay.”
Finally, I got locked up, and so I wanted a clean cut to impress the courts. To no avail, my hairline reminded me of my imperfection. There were two jokes that mar me to this day: “You young with a receding hairline” and “It look like you got shaped up with a shopping cart wheel.” So when I go to the jailhouse barbers, I tell them to shape everything up except the front. Barbers still ask to shape up my front hairline, but I decline their benevolence so I can avoid future damage. I’ve been growing my hair since 2014. My platts now dangle over my forehead to hide my slanted hairline. There are products to aid you in hair growth in bald areas, and until I get my hands on one, I’m content enough with my hairstyle so as to not get another haircut."

Come here, man! We’re over here! Hurry! You gotta see this!” The jocks liked it when I saluted them before making my way around the fire. Both were hot to join the service and kill people in Vietnam. Taylor got fragged by his own men while he slept with the ROTC: Monty triggered a betty while on patrol and wished he was dead the rest of his life.
Off in the dark, 50 feet from the bonfire, the Hippie group stood in a circle, laughing, chuckling and passing a joint. In the middle was Smittie. He was drunk and swaying back and forth, eyes slit, smiling, trying to enjoy his high through the alcohol without quite falling off of a big, 900cc Harley Sportster. The joint made it to him. Smittie wiped the spittle off the end, reared back, sucked in a big hit, then lost his balance. He fell over backward, feet flying up in the air, coughing and hacking his lungs out, all the way to the ground. He hit the grass head first, flipped over onto his belly and lay there, groaning. We all roared together with laughter. Wendy went to aid him; see if he was really hurt. She helped him up. Smittie blinked, squinted all around, stopping at me. “Jay!” he gasped. “Good to see you! You’ll do me a favor, won’t you?” he had a really disarming smile, which is probably a big reason Wendy was with him. Lowering his voice, he told me, “I need you to get rid of this scooter for me. I never should have bought it. If I keep it, it’s going to kill me. See what it did to my knee, man?” he showed me his road rash, all puckered and scabby.
“I’m not stealing your wheels,” I answered flatly, guessing he wanted to pull an insurance scam.
“No,” he replied. “It’ll be fun. Just drive it off the cliff. Nobody will do it for me, and we’re too drunk anyway. You’re smart and sober. You can do it easily!”
I am not a sucker for flattery. The other wanted to see some, Diot tried to kill himself doing something stupid. The idea did not appeal to me. They all believed the drop was 200 feet, the limit of Mexican cliff diver. Everybody seemed to know people who had jumped down and survived, especially the jocks. Of course, everybody could be liars, fools or instigators. The more they tried to talk me into it, the less I wanted any part of it. “No, man,” I finally told them, “I’m not the thrill-seeker type.”
As the party continued, the subject kept coming up, mostly as dares to friends who kept telling us how easy it would be. The higher I got, the more I thought about it. Throwing boulders over the side took six seconds for the noise of the splash to come back up. The math said that this was indeed 200 feet. It also told me that I’d hit at 132 miles per hour. One of the other guys who paid attention in school was Fred. he made his own calculations. They were just as harrowing as mine. All the survival-believers switched sides to join the death-cultists.
People began passing out, slinking off into the privacy of the forest in pairs, or driving off and back for more supplies. One of our groups, a tiny, swarthy Italian girl named Linda offered me a white cross. I laughed at this, then convinced her to let me buy four from her, which I dropped all at once with a swig of Budweiser. We talked for half an hour. Then we had to get up. Our minds revived up even faster than our bodies. We gathered two armloads of fallen branches out of the forest while we cooked up a plan. We threw them both on the dying fire. It blazed up to new heights as we stirred the coals. Soon as it began crackling, I loosed my plan, shouting, “who wants to see me ride this big, heavy piece of shit into the drink?”
“You mean over the cliff?”
“Hell yeah!” I replied, “But I’m not going to kill myself for free! Smittie! Pass the hat around! See what you can get for me.” the “hat” was a greasy Fritos bag. When it came back, it only had $36 in it.
Linda sneered at them, her lip curling with the cutest amount of contempt. “This is shameful!” She scolded. “How about if I go with him? I’m taking the sack around once for me, and it better be full when I finish - everybody!” she shrieked. “Wake up and come back to the fire! You’ll want to see us smash into the water!”
Linda, Smittie and I worked for the crowd until false dawn arrived. Soon as we could see the bottom, it was on! The old trash-fire was hard to start, but fast to warm up. Taking it down the road and around the bonfire gave me a sense of what kind of soggy dog is was. It was like driving half of a car. Linda hopped on back, clamping her arms around me tightly. The thing was so damned loud that I couldn’t hear anyone gasp as I revved it up, popped the clutch and sprinted over the lip. But I could see their eyes pop and their mouths gape before we sailed into space at 40 mph. I shouted “Whee!” for effects, though I doubt anyone heard me but Linda. She screamed involuntarily, but quickly got control of herself. Six seconds of free fall is a lot of time to pass while making sure we got it exactly right. Step one was to gas the engine, which makes the rear wheel twist the bike into an almost vertical wheelie. The Harley was so obese that it took half our fall to do this. Then I ricked it loose; pushing it ahead of us. Linda knew that we didn’t want her to stay on top of me, and behind, to knock our heads together when we hit. It did scare me for a moment. When I kind of panicked, thinking she had frozen instead of remembering the plan. Before I could shout “get off me!” and try to peel her hands off my chest, she released me, pushed loose, and joined me in screaming “Point your toes!” She knew exactly what to do and did it perfectly.
The scooter hit first, making a huge splash 30 feet ahead of me. A quarter-second later, I hit toes first with a slight backward tilt to keep the water from jackhammering up my nose. While I was underwater, I heard and felt the shockwave of Linda hitting the water behind me. We went so deep that it took a moment to struggle back up to the surface. The Harley was a shadow, sinking to the bottom. On the way up, I turned to see Linda. She stroked like a mermaid, her lithe, curvy body strong and sure. We laughed together at the top, then raced to the rocky shore. We took our time winding our way back up the trail to the top, each an arm about the other’s waist. The speed we had eaten still revved our minds and bodies. It had made our insane little trip comparatively easy. Without this little boost in intelligence and planning, our crazy escapade would have truly been some really tricky business."

Rationalization and justification for self-gratification is an undesirable reality. Beautiful images are knowingly and constructively perceived while love’s whisper comes soft and convincing. What He actually said is God-filtered and is truly heard as saying, “I love you. You know me as YeHowshua in Hebrew, and Iesous in Greek. I am Emmanuel (God with us). I bore myself, virgin-born. You know me in physical form as the Son of God, Jesus the Christ, in English. I paid for the cost of all sin (a debt you never could have paid on your own), and then I rose again to life so that you may live as well. I made you like this so that you can choose for yourself. You get to pray and talk to me, or not. You get to read and to study your very own bible; and you get to choose to have faith and to live as I have said, or not. There is good and evil, There is light and darkness, There is heaven, and there is terror in a burning hell.

Other prisoners, including many obviously seriously mentally ill guys (self-mutilators), who’ve also spent long periods in seg, feel comfortable around me (I help them with litigation). This makes me fear that I must appear “crazy,” volatile, “dangerous.” I fear this because it means that both decent prisoners and staff will avoid me while dirty staff and inmates will connive to get me off their radar and back in seg (this happened recently when a razor was planted on me; fortunately I mustered enough evidence to get back out)
My body hurts from anxiety over this Catch-22-seg made me “crazy” and that craziness threatens to isolate me and put me back in seg.
Poison-tipped needles poke deep into my tissues, burning me.
The psychologist is scared of me, not surprisingly. A psychologist at a prior prison poison-penned me, noted in bold capital letters something like, “THIS INMATE WILL ASSAULT STAFF, HAS DONE SO MULTIPLE TIMES.” Prior to that, a psychologist at WI’s super max arranged to have a hit shrink diagnose me as a psychopath and narcissistic, ironic diagnoses given the misery I endured in retaliation for writing complaints and lawsuits for mentally vulnerable prisoners who were being abused by staff. What would/could those prison psychologist say if they saw me talking a self-mutilator out of hurting himself, pushing the wheelchair for a crippled fellow Buddhist, teaching my cellie how to write so he can better understand himself and his emotions, calmly deescalating potentially deadly situations.
My body, my mind - those in power have tried to curse it by labelling it, while claiming to be “correcting” it.
My mind’s ability to reflect on all of this allows me to resist efforts to corrupt me, to understand past mistakes and warpings. At one time I’d’ve put a “but,” left room for excuses for failing to perfectly resist. “But” now I simply wish to be assured that someone understands what I’m saying, who I was, not the creature my captors wish to exist."

Emma, startled out of her sleep by the pounding on her door sits bolt upright.
“What’s going on momma?” she yells at the door.
“I need you tuh takes yo momma tu duh sto’s befo’ they gets crowd’d!”
“Okay momma, I need to jump in the shower first and have a cup of coffee.”
“I’ll makes you some coffee.” her mother responds.
Emma loves her mother but sometimes she just wishes she had her own place. Out loud, Emma says “I’m so sick of driving her all over town for these stupid bargains, all she do is penny pinch, all my life she says “let’s go catch these bargains.” She should have gone to school instead of chasing bargains, walking around here talking like a slave, so embarrassing.”
Emma opens her door to head to the bathroom and stops in her tracks, startled to see her mother standing there with a steaming cup of coffee and tears in her eyes. Without reaching for the coffee Emma asks, “Momma what’s wrong?”
“You wanna know wha’s wrong baby? Let me tell you wha’s wrong…” With trembling hands, she places the cup of coffee into her daughter’s hands. “Eva since you wassa baby I swore you would neva want nuffin’. I was 13 when yo daddy found out I was pregnant and took off. I had no family, no place to go, strangers givin’ me a few dollas here and there to clean they stinky clothes and smelly houses.

“Ha, Ha, well he’s not here either” I reply.
“No! Eddy, I mean he’s gone.”
“Gone where I ask?” with apprehension.
“He took that ole hippy van of his down south of the border to strike gold, the Acapulco kind. The deal went bad, and the Head is dead. Eddy, you need to get back home fast.”  Tony, Kat, and I stood at Dave’s graveside with somber looks. We placed the old boom box upon the coffin’s lid and cranked out Smugglers Blues, knowing Dave was looking down with a pie-eyed grin. We must have sprinkled a lid of that wildwood flower mixed amongst our cigarette butts and burnt roaches among all the flowers on the mound. As the three of us stood there laughing and crying, we thought of Dave in that Cheech & Chong mobile in a cloud of weed, cigarette, and gunsmoke. R.I.P. Dave the Head!
Three short years later, Kat calls me sobbing that the Cruiser went off deadman’s curve. From the report, Tony had been heading home late that night in his souped up GTO when he went off that dreaded curve into a lone oak tree. The first Trooper at the scene stated a cigarette was still smoldering between Tony’s knees and figured it slipped from his grip to his lap. When the Cruiser bent down to retrieve it, he had breathed his last.
It was the fifth of June as we laid Tony to rest. Kat and I stayed as all the others left, placing the same ole boombox upon Cruiser’s casket letting Steppenwolf belt out Born to the Wild. R.I.P. Tony the Cruiser!
Our family plots are arranged just as our childhood homes. Kat turned to me and said, “You’re the only musketeer left.”
“Naw!” I said, wiping at her tears, “We always wanted to make you the fourth.” Turning to me, she touched my cheek and said, “You were always the sweetest and the brightest of the three.”
It had to be that night our oldest daughter Toni was conceived. We have a trio of our own musketeers now with Elizabeth and Destiny all coming three years apart.
But here I am at the age of 33, the father of three and a grandfather never to be. The Doctor just left after saying, “Eddy, I’m sorry there’s nothing we can do. The cancer has spread much further than first thought. You have three months to prepare.”
“Prepare for what? Well Doc, you’re not as sorry as me.” I suppose I can prepare what to have inscribed onto my tombstone. And what to have Kat play on that old boombox we all shared.
I’ve been thinking along the lines of something like Spirit in the Sky or Stairway to Heaven. But why not try something new age like N’Sync’s Bye, Bye, Bye?
Please don’t cry. Soon I’ll be planted between my two best friends. The Three Musketeers to the end!"

Plus, once we were on the road, we were usually calmed down. For one of our vacation road trips, we ended up on the news. We were on I-50, but it ended up snowed out because of an avalanche. We, along with everyone else, sat there for hours waiting for the roads to be cleared. Finally, the authorities told us we wouldn’t be moving forward any time soon. So, we had to turn around, get back to Sacramento, and head up I-80 instead. At the chain/snow tire checkpoint, there was a news crew speaking to drivers about the situation and they stopped at our vehicle. It was great! We finally made it to Tahoe at around midnight, tired but happy to be there.
There were a few road trips that I took alone, like going to Napa to see a girlfriend. However, the destination and seeing her were more important than the trip itself. One trip from Napa with the same girlfriend is still one of my best memories. It’s nice to remember her and that road trip. She is one person from my past that I definitely miss, despite the mess of that time.
No matter what the road trip was however, one thing was almost always a constant for me:
An escape from the abuse.
Not to mention the absence of arguments (most of the time). The road trips were an enjoyable part of my life. Often filled with music (we would take a tapecase full of cassettes), singing, and conversation. Maybe this is why I enjoyed just driving.
Now, as I sit in prison with a life without and in the hole at the moment, I have something good to think about. There may not be much that’s good from my childhood, but I know there’s something. And if there’s that, there may be more. I just have to remember."

She honked the horn and a strange man that looked like a Mexican Yosemite Sam came out holding a small bag and an accordian. Tucked into his waistband was a 38, 6 shooter, revolver.
“Wow, our tio looks like a badass,,” I said to my sister, Gloria.
That ain’t our tio,” Gloria said as the man leaned into the driver side window and tongue kissed our mom. “That’s your new dad.”
Oh, hell no! My real dad was better than Batman and Superman put together, why would I need a new one? Whatever the case, I shook off the shocking expression on my face and got with the program real quick.
My new dad, Alias, slid into the driver’s seat and quickly introduced himself.
“Mom, what’s going on? Where did this man come from? Where are you really taking me? What happened to my real dad?” I was demanding answers.
“I’ll explain it all when we get back to your uncle’s.” mom kept saying while she made goo goo eyes at her new camote. They couldn’t keep their hands off of each other.
Maybe if they’d focused on the road, mom and her new man would’ve reached our destination sooner. But all that ‘hanky-panky’ kept getting us derailed and lost. At every gas station, they’d ask the attendant for directions. It turns out that my uncle lived very far away; Amarillo, Texas to be exact. (Many years later, while I was on a prison bus to Oklahoma, I learned that a trip from Northern California to Amarillo, Texas, took 20 hours.) It took my mom and Alias 3 days to reach our destination.
Exhausted upon arrival, my mom parked her car outside of a farm and honked the horn. The first thing I remember was how foul the farm smelled. The place reeked of cow manure, and the pigpen on the side of his property wasn’t helping anything.
Tio, Chuey, greeted us on his front lawn and introduced us to his wife and family. He had 2 boys my age, a little girl, and twin baby girls. Then, he took his 22 rifle out to the pigpen and shot one right between the eyes. He gutted it in front of us and made chicharones for dinner.
Right away, we moved into a house a few blocks away and mom enrolled us in school. “I hope you know we spank the kids here when they get outta line.” the principal said to my mother. “Do you have a problem with that?”
“No problem,” my mom said, “Dale duro.” This was a nightmare.
My sister became an instant celebrity while all the kids in my class, including my teacher, hated me. They said I talked funny and called me a dirty hippie.
Alias was never home at that time, he found a job and they were working him like a dog. We didn’t miss him one bit.
We were scheduled to spend the rest of our lives in Amarillo until I got really sick. The doctor didn't think I was going to make it. Mom didn’t want me dying in Texas, so one day while Alias was at work, my mom decided to jump ship and abandoned Alias. Karma’s a bitch. Quickly, mom packed up our meager belongings and hit the road, Jack.
On the trip back home, I was dying on the back seat while my sister nursed me to no avail, but as soon as we crossed the ‘Welcome to California’ sign, I started feeling better. And in the blink of an eye, I was cured, back in LA; living with my old dad and my new mom. But that’s another story.

All the officers who go out of their way to make things tougher than they need to be, all the inmates who whine and complain about anything and everything, and all the frustration from not being able to do things when I want are all the major motivations to rehabilitate myself.

I checked the time on the information bar -- 1:49pm. Paul that he could have it done by 2:00.
I clicked REFRESH. The site reloaded.
Did Rachel fear death? She seemed to look forward to it. Of course, it wouldn’t be death in actuality, especially since the living, breathing Rachel existed in the outside world, unaware of her digitized doppelganger. Still, in the weeks I had to get to know the digital Rachel, she became very real to me.

 I didn’t see how, and I know she felt isolation if not outright loneliness. It never occurred to me that it might have hurt. I didn’t want to think about it.



It struck me odd to think that arranging her death equated saving her, but I understand. The day Paul took the picture, the day of the accident, human Rachel laid in a coma from which her doctors gave her no hope of surviving.
So Paul, in his grief, did the unthinkable. He hijacked experimental equipment from the college where they researched the next generation of social media. Dubbed EternalNet, the theory consisted of capturing the memories of terminal family members and uploading them to their own memorial page. They abandoned the project for reasons Paul wouldn’t divulge, but not before he succeeded in uploading a copy of Rachel’s memories.
It was past 2:00. I clicked REFRESH, and the site reloaded. Relieved, I typed back .
Paul admitted that he interacted with the digital Rachel when not visiting her comatose body at the hospital. That all changed a little over a year later when Rachel woke up.
The doctors referred to Rachel as their “Miracle Girl.” Paul spent every spare moment with her through her rehab until the day he brought her home. They got married and had children. Abandoned, digital Rachel languished alone in cyberspace.
At least, until my typo. Even then she might have remained trapped, if the flurry of , , and  in the message box had not piqued my curiosity.
So I spent weeks getting to know the ethereal, disembodied memories of digital Rachel. I gained an appreciation of the depth of Paul’s love for her which drove him to do something so amazing and horrific for her at the same time. She begged me for release and for death.
I learned enough to hunt down Paul and loved her enough to save her.


I clicked REFRESH. She was free."

Spring Fever By Leo Cardez
I pissed on my celly today. I literally have Spring Fever. It’s the first day of Spring and I have a 102 temperature. It was the perfect storm. I had been in and out of consciousness all night alternating between shivers and sweats. At some point In the middle of the night I stumbled out of my top bunk and over to our in-cell toilet. My celly had fallen asleep with his head just a few feet from the toilet. Normally, he sleeps on the opposite side, but he had passed out watching TV. I remember I tried to angle myself just so to block his view and that of any passing officer. It all went sideways from the go. A strong split stream shot out creating a perfect 90 angle that smacked my celly right In the face. For a half second I was frozen in shock simply watching him wake up to a golden shower. I tried to jerk away while pinching down, but It only made things worse. The fire hose flow soaked my celly’s bed.
“What the fuck?!”
“Holy shit bro, my bad.”
“The fuck you talkin bout my bad? You just fuck’n pissed on me!”

The sleet was changing to snow, and the convoluted flakes were growing larger and larger just like her anger. They covered her head and face, making her mascara run and dampening her hair which she got done in the way Mark liked. She remembered how his fingers ran through it two nights ago under the stars in his front yard when they sat on the hood of his Jeep Wrangler. It reminded her of the way he flipped her bangs out of her eyes while sitting cross-legged together on the dock of the beach house during one summer afternoon.
They met as high school juniors, and she was immediately attracted to him and loved his ruddy looks, winsome smile, and the way he would hold her while they danced. As seniors, they were inseparable at every major event: homecoming, prom, graduation, and summer vacation. They were made for each other. Or so she thought.
They were both accepted to University during the summer and were excited to attend together because it was a commuter college: they could still live at home and continue to see each other. She enrolled in the teacher education program and couldn’t wait to take practicums which required her to work with needy kids. Her ultimate goal was to have her own children and start a big family with Mark.
Mark wanted to attend because he figured he could make their hockey team as a walk-on, and so he practiced tirelessly five afternoons a week starting in August. He skated and shot pucks until the sweat would drip off his forehead, and then he would shower and do the same in the evening. He made the team as a starting forward, and while the games began in October, Tracey noticed a difference in him before that. He started hanging out with his buddies from the team and their fans, mostly pretty girls. They had an undying passion for the sport and followed the team everywhere. Tracey couldn’t understand their fierce fervency--shouldn’t they be putting that energy toward their future aspirations?
Kathy’s right foot suddenly slipped off the top step, but she fell into Mark’s chest as he held her steady. She buried her face deep in his varsity jacket the same way Tracey did took solace in him.
Mark grabbed both her hands and slowly leaned toward her with his mouth ajar, and their lips met in a tender kiss which caused them both to step back and smile. He hugged her tightly in his arms, her breath misting at his neck.
All of Tracey’s dreams came crashing to a halt: their elegant wedding, their Hawaiian honeymoon, formal galas she would attend in lacy dresses clutching Gucci purses, hospital stays bearing children, family holidays, grandchildren running around their rocking chairs on the front porch, and their retirement on their 50-foot sailboat in the Caribbean.
While her coat and skin were thoroughly drenched, Mark and Kathy were still embracing each other and happily swaying in each other’s arms on the top step of the fieldhouse. The way she saw it, Tracey had two choices. She could walk away then quietly break it off with him, citing some trivial reason like they were growing apart and needed space.
Or she could confront him. She could stomp right over, break up their little tryst, and put him on the spot. But that would mean causing a scene. Could she do that? When she remembered the fleeting dreams, she snapped her umbrella open and marched toward the steps."

The CBU model attempts to place certain inmates together in a safer environment with the understanding that our conduct and behaviour must be above and beyond that of other units. I feel that this model allows one to be more genuine without fear of reprisal. So it seems for now that my pre-incarceration notions were unfounded.
Being very new to prison and the CBU itself, I’ve found the need to apologize quite often in the last few days. Not that my conduct was out of line or my behaviour was suspect, but the new way of life and the rules that apply come with a bit of a learning curve.
Something as benign as turning your sheets in to be laundered on a certain day early cost a night of being locked down in my cell. Apologies to the sergeant and to the inmate in charge of laundry spared me that punishment. Thankfully, my “Mea Culpa” was met with an “it’s ok” reply. I’ve learned that every apology in her is not always met with a reassuring reply.
In fact, I’ve also learned that while I may deserve an apology from a staff member for being slighted, it neither came nor should it be expected in the future. I’m learning that in prison, the concept of an apology and the anticipated forgiving response is not always a two-way street."

We sat down and I reviewed all the sheets. I totally creeped her out by making a mark on everyone who came in that was assigned to Camp Prisoney Land. If I was unsure, I would close my eyes and do a little humming thing and wiggle my fingers in the air. In truth, I only do that for effect. There were six unfamiliar names. I wrote them down for her. Two of them were the names of the work release people. Magic, right?
Unfortunately, I can’t match names to faces. So half the time when people are talking to me, I have no idea who they are. I have to look at their name tags. You would think I would be able to remember people’s nicknames. Alas, I cannot. There are too many. And people don’t pick original names. Philadelphia, Texas, Velvet, Tay, Murder. These are not very original. Maybe if they picked something like Honey-Boo-Boo Lips, I might remember that. Instead I have the government name in my memory selector. Sorry if your name Is Eunice, Bobbi-Rae-Sue, Norma, etc. If it’s not thug enough for your tastes you should take that up with your parents, Tiffany. Or the person whose identity you stole. And I am sorry you are identifying as a boy now, Amanda. It’s just too hard to remember your new nickname. In fact, if I am too confused about whom I am speaking to, you’ll be lucky if I get the first letter right.
One day I was serving one of my clients in confinement. The girl’s real name was Shanna Kurlew. Thus her nickname, Shank. She was in administrative confinement. That day I was in a hurry and I was tired. When I called her to the door, I mistakenly called her Skank. Oops! She leapt as if I’d slapped her through the glass window and said “Ms. LaFleur, how could you!” The officer with me thought that was hysterical and nearly flipped over the second tier railing. I told Shank, you have a choice of Shanna or Kurlew. Pick one.
People often forget my name. I get called by Charlotte, Christine, Lurry, Flora, Floor, McFlurry. One calls me Renee. She is age 74 and when I respond, she remarks how thrilled she is to get my name correct. I tell her you sure did get it right, honey! If I think someone is talking to me I will respond….

Her hands came away red and sticky. Evelyn knelt there, gun in hand, waiting for the scene to make sense. A storm began to howl outside. Evelyn almost missed the voice the hall over the rain and the sound of her own heart in her ears. “...safe was empty, she tried to run, so I handled it. I’ll bring the other one to you, so be ready.” Evelyn had a feeling that the “other one” was her, and so she turned and aimed the gun at the door. What happens when we gotta act the part?” She heard the door creak, closed her eyes, said a quick prayer that sounded like “Oh God” and emptied her gun in the door’s general direction.
Evelyn stopped screaming when she realized that her screaming was the only noise in the apartment. She opened her eyes. The grabber was in a clumsy heap leaning against the fully opened door. Hsi phone was in his hand, and a call was still connected. It definitely was time to move. “Did you get her? Did you get the files?” She heard a voice yelling from the Grabber’s phone. She ran over and ended the call. The files were still here. That was her only lifeline; she has something they need.
Evelyn went to the small bedroom, changed out of her running clothes and slipped on jeans and a t-shirt. She had to step onto the bed to get to the air duct. SHe pried off the grate, reached into the duct, and pulled out a small safe. The tall, green gun safe in the closet was just a decoy while the safe in her hands was the real prize. In it was $200,000 cash and four sets of fake identities including passports, driver’s licenses, credit cards. The safe also held two more guns, two prepaid phones and the thumb drive that would either save her life or get her killed. She emptied the contents of the safe into her gym bag. She made sure to take her laptop too. On her way out, Evelyn stopped to look at her partner and said, “Sorry I didn’t trust you. Sorry this happened to you.” She would cry later.
Evelyn stepped over the grabbed, staying well clear of his hands, to get to the raincoat and umbrella on the coat rack. The raging storm was now quiet pitter-patter against the side of the building. Downstairs, she opened the umbrella and stepped out into the rain. Where was she going? How would she get there? What’s in that file? One thing at a time, she thought. That’s how to finish a long run: one foot in front of the other, one step at a time."

truly such a rare find
I grew up in a world where hula-hoops and hip huggers, corduroys and tinker toys and pet rocks and pebbles in bedrock were nothing more than a passing fancy, but rock was here to stay. So, on a whim, I took a lapidary course while in high school. What a geek huh? Anyway, whether I was up at the creek, down the river, on edge in a fog or simply at bay, I waded out into the troubled water until I hit rock bottom then, leaving no stone unturned, I dug down deep.
The guess I found were all wet, but by the time I cut them down to size, smoothed off the rough edges and shaped them into what I was looking for, they had already lost their luster just like all my other accomplishments in this life.
The American Heritage Dictionary-Second College Edition defines accomplishment as “the act of accomplishing or state of being accomplished: completion.” Over the past half-a-century, I completed several different tasks. I went to prison (though still not complete), abandoned my loving wife and kids, lost my gorgeous baik home, my three cars were repossessed, and squandered away my self-worth.
So, the next time you’re begging about all your accomplishments don’t forget about the more important ones in your life."

Who is the one person whose goal and objective is to confuse your thinking? To cause you doubt? That’s right, it’s our number one adversary, the Devil!
First, let me say, “God is not the author of confusion” (1 Cor 14:33), this is the work of Satan, who is attacking you, and I can tell you this: Satan is dedicated to his work!
Our fight against the devil is not an easy one, but is one we can win. So when you feel the devil start to tug on your shirt tail, go to your quiet place, and tell it to God. He’s got your back and he will put the devil in his place!
God’s word is our defense against the attacks of Satan. In Psalms 109:29, it says, “let my adversaries be clothed with shame and cover them with their own confusion”. Our defense is our prayer to God in Psalms 71:1 where it says, “Lord, never let me be put to confusion”.

Our parents learned from their parents how to be crappy parents. The first people we learn from and model ourselves after are our parents. From our parents, we learn what people are and how they act; we learn what we are likely to grow up to be; we learn how men should relate with their mates; and we learn how to raise children. Many people, due to their innate personality (inherited from parents) and values (much learned from parents), desperately cling to what they learned from their parents, even if what they’ve learned is proven wrong or evil! (Look at the hate in the world -- thanks mommy and daddy!)
Even if not entirely decisive, parenting is central to our development. This morally obliged parents to guide our development, to nurture us so that we can live healthy, safe, fulfilled lives in the world that they brought us into. Yet there is a noxious view, inspired by the commandment to “honor thy father and they mother,” that children are little more than slaves to who parents should, “spare not the rod.” That noxious view is cherished by many child abusers, by many prisoncrats, and by many predatory politicians who’ve climbed to power on the broken bonds of prisoners.
Ignorance of how people work and clinging to flawed traditions is causing people much senseless misery.
This is merely an abstract…., not relevant to all prisoners.
Notes:

Even in the most abusive homes, parents are, sometimes, kind, loving, which doesn’t compensate for abuse. See, e.g. A Mother’s Touch, Trafford (2006), p. 165: this is an excellent book when it comes to explaining how abuse can warp children’s development.
See the August 2017 post, “Society Makes Its Criminals,” on http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540 for a fuller explanation of how child abuse/neglect creates criminals. Also see A Mother’s Touch, supra, pp. 28, 150, 154-155.

I remember how we would get off the ferry in Oak Bluffs and look out over the island. Seth would spread his arms as wide as he could and say, “See Sis, it’s God’s great canvas.” Each new day here was one of God’s fantastic paintings to my brother.
Each year as we would cross over the Bourne bridge and finally arrive at the Cape, I would see Seth’s eyes light up. It was only then that I knew our summer could begin. He would look down from that great bridge into the canal below and just smile. God, he had the most amazing smile.

But it did the unthinkable by turning its back on me by taking my little brother’s life! How can I continue to love it while hating it for what it took from me? The answer must be here, somewhere.
This mournful rain, the gloom. Oh why did I come, why Lord?
Wait! I don’t believe it. Out in the water, I’ve never seen them this close to shore. It’s a pod of whales! Seth loved the whales so much. He spent hours and hours watching them. These gentle giants of the sea were his best friends.
This must be my answer. God and my brother, together, painting me the picture I so desperately needed to see. The canvas is here in the middle of this timeless rain. I can feel Seth here with me. Everything is so clear now.
How could I have been so selfish, thinking only of myself and my feelings? This morning I questioned even getting out of bed. I saw only darkness and gloom in the falling rain. I almost turned around while driving along Route 28 to the dock in Falmouth. I even cried silent tears from my seat aboard the Island Queen, a ferry boat ride I normally hold dear.
I’ve made this island trip countless times, and despite my hesitancy to come today, I just knew I had to. Something was...different. Now I see that this was a gift, wrapped in a hidden blanket of beauty. I thought this trip would break me, but I was wrong. This canvas before me has instead renewed me!
I am comforted now, knowing my brother is safe--happy. This place he knew so well lives on; his wondrous playground will always exist. The proof is out there before me in the water, in these magnificent whales.
Had I stayed in bed today, the gift of the painting would have been lost, swept away with the churning currents of the Cape Cod Canal.
As these whales move off toward the unknown, I can now release this moment in time. I can let it go into the past, along with my pain. This moment is now a sweet memory belonging to Seth and me. That, in itself, is magical.
You know, this morning I saw this rain as bullets of pain, and now I see it as the soothing, joyful tears of my little brother falling from heaven, as if to say “Hey Sis, it’s okay.”
A timeless rain indeed!
I see the whales now, one last time, further out. They are breaching the surface playfully, vanishing from my view. Disappearing into the waters of…my Cape Cod, my new magical playground!
Thank you Seth, thank you God. I love you. Bring on the wonder, bring on the life. Happy thirteenth birthday little brother. God speed."

If you realize the way you’ve been looking at something has started to aggravate unskillful mental states, either look away or learn to look at the same thing in a way that counteracts those mental states. The same applies to what you listen to, what you smell, what you taste, what you touch, and especially what you think about.
If you can keep your attention focused on the way in which the mind initiates sensory contact and is affected by sensory contact, you’re staying focused inside even as you look or listen outside. This helps to keep the center of your focus firm and resilient throughout the day."

She got to see Daddy again on Saturday, but it was at a special place. They had to wait and then Daddy showed up in his blue clothes (he always wears the same thing now). They get her any snack she wants from the machines and then they eat together at the table and talk. Sometimes Mommy gets mad at Daddy. Sometimes they play Go Fish. Daddy can't come home with us yet. He's on a time-out for driving too fast.
Daddy’s home now, but on Saturday she has Cheerleading or Volleyball practice. He doesn't wash the car anymore anyway – he just takes It to where Mommy took it. He’s so sad now. He always has to go to meetings – like, all the time.
She turned 16 today; Daddy is washing the car; he asks her to help. She doesn't want to, but he insists. They play their little game, she thought she forgot, and end up soaking wet on the lawn.

In school Red Dot, Rob, and Ken started hanging out. They listened to classic rock, Motley Crue, Guns n Roses, Poison. They took up music class and formed a band. “The Dogs” started drinking, smoking cigarettes, and weed. Red Dot, had to be high to write. He’s a great writer when high. Ken he knows the drums. Rob he barely can sing or he was just so high and drunk he just sounded good. He was practically for a show. When Bret Michaels walked in, sat down, and listened to use them he walked on stage and said,
“Boys, you sound okay but you got to get that fire.” He threw the mic to Rob. “Come on, let it flow. Run around, get your blood flowing.”
They did a song the way Bret said and it was easy or practice and I wait to bring you Dogs to my studio. Stop smoking a little weed is okay, you don’t want to mess your voice up so the groups members practice and got their chance and toured with Poison. This is the start of the group called the Dogs."

To come to you while you are in my care.

Allow a single ill to befall you

Carried himself like a common lammox,

You know even his wife still laughs and japes.

The little girl I once pushed on a swing is now dating and driving. Her independence makes me sad but proud. Having to let her go is like taking off a limb. I knew these days would come though there’s no way to prepare for them. But I still feel her presence, the phantom limb.
I see her when she’s alone, as I pass by her room or while she’s lounging on the couch or studying at a desk. I look at this small miracle of evolution that I’ve created and know she’s the best thing I’ve done, and ever will do. She’s made me a better man and is more than just an alternate version of myself. She is an answer to the future I will not see. But, to create something good for a future you won’t see takes incredible selflessness and it is this enduring legacy that is the ultimate fulfillment of man.

From the passenger seat of the Montecarlo. As I looked to see who was yelling my name I noticed that. He was bringing something up lap, and me being very street wise, instinct took over when I saw the dark gray tube of metal rise to point in my direction. I knew at that moment that I was in trouble.
In my mind, I couldn’t figure out who it was or why they were aiming a gun at me or who it was or why they were trying to kill me. A myriad of thoughts swam through my mind. As these thoughts were swimming through my conscious mind my subconscious was taking over my body. I dodged right and then I ran left toward oncoming traffic. Which was in the opposite direction in which the assailant car was pointed.
There was a cacophony of sound all around me. I was in mental turmoil. I experienced a mind-body disconnect. All thoughts were separate and simultaneous. I devolved into an animal state for a split second that seemed like hours. And for the moment, I thought life was at its end for me.
Until I came back to my present sense and noticed that I was running. So I ran faster. And bullets kept coming. I ran faster than I have ever ran up until that point in my life. Yet I was hit. Then hit again. But I didn’t stumble or fall. I ran along the front of the apartment building next to the corner store. The end seemed miles away. I was struggling to make it to the end so I could round the corner and be out of harm’s way.
I made it to the corner followed by a hail of bullets. I cut a left at the corner then another left into the alley behind the apartment to a friend’s house. I made my way through their yard to their back door and began pounding on it yelling for them to open up and that I was just shot at. And that I believe was hit.
They let me in seeing the blood on my face and neck they quickly rushed me to the bathroom to clean me up and check my wounds.
As it turned out, I was not shot. I caught some brick shrapnel from the bullets impacting with the buildings facade that was embedded in my head and neck. Very small pieces. But scars that I still have nearly 30 years later.
After I was cleaned up, I went back to my mother’s home to check on my daughter and to let my mother know what happened and to make some phone calls, strangely I did not feel any fear what I felt was rage.
After I informed my mother as to what transpired, she wanted to get the family involved. Which entails getting pony down involved (pony down was a ruling class family gang that controlled the westside of detroit in the early 60’s 70’s and 80’s to which I am related to). And I said “No mom, we can handle this on our own. I don’t want war.”
My phone calling came up with no leads. So when it was dark, I went back-out and asked people around the neighbors if they knew who those guys were. And to my surprise, everyone heard about the shooting of course, but some people actually knew the guys that shot at me and the car they drove. My thoughts were only on revenge and why.
I found that they lived in Southwest Detroit. Which we call Latin town or Spanish town. Because of all of the Spanish speaking people who migrated there, and I found a mutual acquaintance of ours to get us to meet about a week after the incident. To get to the bottom of this.
As it turned out, I was the wrong “crazy.” They wanted the “crazy” that lived off Meyers and Plymouth Road. I stayed a mile and a half down West of Plymouth road off Hubble. And someone pointed me out they knew my name was “crazy,” so they almost killed the wrong guy.
And since they almost killed me for reasons unknown I was allowed to fight all three of them one by one. Because I asked if I could. And to my greatest delight neither of them could fight well or it was my rage guided me, and I won all three fights.
I was so filled with rage that day. To be nearly killed by accident. Through mistaken identity because someone had the same name as mine. So instead of verifying their info, they’d just decided to start shooting. And I still didn’t find out why I was being shot at. No one ever told me why I was going to be killed. Talk about a close call.
That just goes to show that some things are accidents and some are close calls."

I wasn’t in the mood to get burned by my cohorts across the hall in the odd-numbered cells.

The Silver Pixie frowned. “That’s good. It’s a sorry situation when you have to get a lawyer just to get your medication.”
I had to be careful where I looked. “Yeah, it was really a sorry situation.” It was a sorry situation that my cohorts acted like monkeys in the monkey house.

“Shut up, bitch!”
“Breaking Ice Ain’t Nice,” warned Silver Pixie. “You’ll read all about it.”
After about an hour the Legal Mail Man came to the cell of Goat-Smelling Monkey. “Are you Offender Whistledick? Dorian Whistledick? That you? Alright; I’ve got a Legal Mail for you from the Texas Attorney General.” The Legal Mail Man made a show of opening sealed envelopes, then flourishing the paperwork to Goat-Smelling Monkey. “Alright, Offender Whistledick. Thank you.”
“Man! Naw, das bullshit!” screamed Goat-Smelling Monkey. “Dey caint do dat! Das bull shit! Naw!
Another cohort sympathized. “Man, you already know. Texas Attorney General doan send no letter except one reason, You getting’ sued for back child support, Dorian? How much?

Five witnesses came forward with knowledge proving my innocence, and my attorneys built a case that proved I had nothing to do with the murder, and a medical examiner who did the immediate autopsy ruled me out. The cause of death, timing, and everything with the case helped me. I won’t go into detail because the case is ongoing.
Knowing what I know now, I am no longer scared. I’m just waiting for my day in court. Since I’ve been locked up I’ve lost the majority of my friends who I thought were my ride-or-dies. I’ve lost the majority of my family that I barely knew anyway, and I lost the girlfriend who was always whispering “forever” to me. All these people eventually disappeared from my life. The only person I’ve got left now is my grandmother who is slowly dying of brain cancer. She lives a couple counties away from the jail, so she can drive to visit through a program called Securus. So even though Grandma is far away and dying of cancer, she faithfully visits me for thirty minutes every night at seven.
Out of sight, out of mind. That’s what happened. Everyone I knew saw my charge, not my case. They figured me as a ‘dead weight’ or a loose end,’ which technically I am right now. Nobody saw me coming out of this alive. The truth will prove them wrong. I don’t mind that they left me anymore. I’ve had a long three years to find the positive. I’m clean, no drugs, back to normal, no paranoia, no longer aggressive, and I’ve found peace. All the people who deserted me were no good for me anyway. They would forever remind me of the ‘old me’---they were users and if I had kept in touch, I wouldn’t be able to get out and not get high. It’s just how it is.
So now I’m thankful that they are all gone. I’m thankful I’ve got this peace; I’m happy I’ve matured. Looking at what I’m fighting showed me where my life was heading. I’m thankful I was given the chance to see ahead. I feel like I was given a second chance. This, I plan to use wisely. I pray my grandma is alive when I get out, because she’s all I’ve got right now, but I’m prepared either way to make something better for my life.
I describe my feelings for this situation as gratitude. I took all the lemons, and made some ice-cold lemonade."

Lilly twisted, turned, poked, and prodded her pliant reeds into her inspired basket design and Ulysses pumped his bellows, stirred the red-hot coals and tested the trueness of his four round discs as he contemplated the various methods to attach them to the frame. Each was focused on their own trivialities of his life and spent no effort considering what lay ahead for each of them.
Paddling languidly around the lake, Horatio was unaware of an alien, a newcomer to Loving Lake, swimming purposefully at the bottom, but his eyes focused on the perceived meal swimming on the surface. Finley C. Sturgeon was hungry and his natural reflexes to feed had kicked in and Finley was reduced to a feeding machine anxious to be filled.
With a flick of his powerful rail, Finley launched himself off the bottom, lunging upward, his razor-sharp tooth-filled jaws agape, aimed directly at the paddling feet of Horatio, hoping to feed on succulent duck!
SNAP! His jaw closed powerfully on Horatio’s feet but Finley had put too much effort into his attempt, and he bit clear through both feet, leaving poor Horatio with no means to walk, waddle, or paddle. In pain, but striving to survive, Horatio frantically flapped his wings, propelling him towards the bank of Loving Lake and safety!
“Quack! Quack!” warned Horatio to the others on the lake. “Be aware! Predator in the Lake! Seek safety, NOW!
Poindexter, hearing disturbance, looked around himself, searching for any danger in his immediate vicinity. Seeing no threat, he expanded his focus to include the lake where the disturbance seemed to originate. There on the lake, he spotted ducks and geese frantically flapping their wings in an effort to gain lift off the lake and into relative safety. But wait, not all of them were succeeding. Poindexter noticed Horatio frantically flapping his wings, unable to fly but gradually progressing toward the shallows.
Wanting to offer his assistance if needed, Poindexter rushed to the bank where it seemed Horatio would arrive if he continued his struggles. “Horatio, what’s the matter? Do you need help? What’s wrong?” cried out a bewildered Poindexter. Thank you, Poindexter, A giant fish bit off both my legs and I am unable to walk, waddle, or paddle. I can’t swim or even fly with no feet. I’ve gone as far as I can, and I need your help to get out of the water. Please help me!”
“I can’t swim Horatio, but if I back up to the water’s edge and extend my tail perhaps you can grip it in your bill, and I can pull you out of the water.”
This was quickly accomplished and once on dry land Horatio collapsed in exhaustion, gasping out, “oh Poindexter, thank you for rescuing me, but what’s to be done? I can’t provide for my family like this! What should I do?”
“I’ll head to town and see if I can find others to help you and maybe come up with some ideas. Try to relax and I’ll be back before you know it,” Poindexter told Horatio.
Rushing into town, Poindexter passed by the foundry and noticed Ulysses admiring a metal sculpture. “Ulysses, Horatio had both legs bitten off on the lake this morning and can now not walk, waddle, or paddle. Do you have any ideas to help him?”
I’ve been focused on my sculpture all morning and I just finished it”, replied Ulysses, “what do you think?”
It is certainly unique, but I don’t have time to stop and fully appreciate it right now. I have to find help for Horatio, and Poindexter was off!
House to house, Poindexter stopped, inquiring as to any ideas for his friends and neighbors that would solve Horatio’s dilemma.
Kristine Cow, ever mindful of her environment and willing to be of assistance, called to Poindexter, “Go see Lilly. Her head is always full of ideas and no one is as creative as she is. If anyone can help, it will be Lilly!”
With a polite, “thank you,” Poindexter was off in search of Lilly, which proved easy enough as her lilting song wafted on the breeze and led Poindexter directly to where Lilly was working.
“Lilly, I need your help. Horatio lost both of his legs this morning and is unable to walk, waddle or paddle. He can’t provide for his family in this condition and he needs our help! Do you have any ideas?”
“I am sorry”, said Lilly, I’ve been totally involved in creating this new basket all morning. It turned out beautifully, don’t you agree?”
“It is really creative and well-built, but I’m in a rush and must find a solution to the problem of mobilizing Horatio, so I really must run” and away he sped, off to find someone able to render assistance to Horatio.
Clyde Horse, Stacey Pig, Forrest Squirrel and Roofs L. Canine all were consulted, sympathized but were clueless as to how they could be of any aid to their friend Horatio.
Dejected, Poindexter returned to the bank of Loving Lake to break the bad news to Horatio. Maybe together, they’d find a solution to the problem, to his surprise, Lilly, Ulysses and Kristine were already with Horatio and seemed to be brainstorming a solution.
Suddenly, Lilly perked up, her wings excitedly and proclaimed, “I’ve got it! Today, I created a large unique basket that I believe Horatio will fit in, then someone can carry him about. In the basket, he won’t need his legs.”
“Great idea, Lilly, go get it immediately,” chimed in Kristine.
“It is far too big for me to carry,” chirped Lilly, when Ulysses grunted, “I’ll carry it for you! I’m big and strong so a basket will not be heavy for me”, and off they went to retrieve Lilly’s basket. When Ulysses laid eyes on the basket, he was struck by the size and shape of the thing. “You know Lilly, I do believe your basket is the perfect size to fit into a sculpture I finished just this morning. I’ll run over to my shop and get it. I think I have an idea!”, and off he ran to retrieve his amazing sculpture.
Ulysses returned with his sculpture tucked firmly under one arm, then gently set it alongside Lilly's basket, visually measuring both to ascertain if a proper fit were possible. Carefully lifting the basket, Ulysses set it firmly in place on top of his sculpture, realizing they seemed made to be together.
“they certainly look as if they were made together, but won’t it be too heavy to carry Horatio in?”, Lilly fretted.
“only one way to tell,” grunted Ulysses. “I’ll carry this down to the lake and we’ll try it out.”
Arriving together at the lake, Lilly & Ulysses explained their idea to the others, who remained, skeptical, but willing to try anything that might benefit their friend.
Ulysses set the contraption down, lifted Horatio gently into the basket and stood back to evaluate their results.
“it fits like a glove,” said Horatio, “and it is a lovely piece of art, but how will I move about?”
“I can carry you,” ventured Ulysses, “just tell me where you need to go.”
You have your shop to run and cannot be at my beck and call all day. Thank you, but we need another idea.
“I’m retired and free all day, “chimed in Poindexter, wanting to be helpful, “but I’m too small to lift you alone, never mind all this basketry and sculpture. I’m just so frustrated! There has to be a reasonable solution somewhere.” And with that, Poindexter gave up and just leaned all his weight against the sculpture.
“Look what’s happening,” yelled Kristine, that thing moved easily on those four discs when Poindexter leaned on it! Try pushing it Poindexter, I believe you’ve solved our problem,
Tentatively, Poindexter placed his forepaws on the sculpture, pushed gently, and they were off!
“problem solved,” declared Kristine. “Poindexter has free time to push Horatio around so he can provide for his family. We put aside our differences, exploited our talents, realized a problem and worked together to achieve a mutually beneficial solution. That’s what makes us a community!”."

The greyhound left me about six miles from the house. I stuck out my thumb.
No one stopped. No one slowed down.
Instead of the state highway, I hiked along a county road that went by the cemetery. I visited my parents’ grave. I didn’t know where my brother was.
As I approached the house, I saw Mrs. Brown sitting on her front porch knitting - or maybe crocheting. Whatever she did with those needles most evenings. Sandy was standing beside her, probably urging her to put her stuff away and retire inside with a hot cup of tea. A thin stream of white smoke was rising from the chimney. All the snow within three feet of the bricks was melted, exposing a growing patch of dry shingles. Sandy was as beautiful as ever. After twenty months in prison, all the girls looked good -even her mother- but none could compete with Sandy. She used to smile when she saw me. Or so I imagined. And I’d always gotten a boner when I saw her. But somehow the girl next door had remained far away.
Mrs. Brown got up and turned away toward her front door. Sandy looked at me for a few seconds. I couldn’t see her eyes well yet, but I knew they were blue and beautiful. She seemed to be starting into the aching emptiness of my soul. I know she recognized me but there was no longer any warmth or tenderness in her gaze. In fact, she seemed a bit nervous.
I know I was.
I had dreamed of this moment. She had bounded down the porch steps and across the lawn. Her mother wasn’t in the dream just the two of us. She had thrown herself into my arms and we’d fallen into a bank. I’d…
Sandy opened the door and helped her mother carry her carpet bag into the house.
Then I saw my friends in the background, standing near the edge of the woods. I know he recognized me, but he showed neither tongue not fang. He stared intently at me, head high ears erect, body tense. It was the first time I’d seen him with his tail down since he was a puppy.
I called him.
He turned away.
The house was dusty. I heard water in the pipes and air in the ducts. A rafter creaked. At first I heard an occasional drip outside my window, but by midnight the icicles hanging from the gutter had frozen again. THe house was too big for one prisoner. It was darker, lonelier, and creepier than my cell had been.
In the morning, I went to the back door as had been my custom and duty in happier times. A bowl was on the sundeck, nothing in it but a little melting ice. The show was almost gone but I could still see a few fading tracks. Something had come from the woods and crossed the back lawn, padded up the steps and one circuit around the deck. Then he’d gone back the way he came."

As my feet brought me closer to the front door, I heard slapping going on. As my hand reached the storm door, my two children were slapping one another. I don't mean love taps. Both of their faces were red and tears streamed out of their eyes. I’m talking young, my daughter was thirteen while my son was nine. After working a twenty-four hour shift at the Emergency Medical Service, I didn't need to walk into nothing like this. I was tired and needed rest and peace and quiet.
I spoke loudly and asked what was going on. They did not stop. I got in between the two and said enough is enough. Go to your rooms. They shut their doors and I asked their mom what was going on; she didn't even know was all I got. I responded and said are you not the parent here. Still she looked dumbfounded.
As I talked to both kids seperate I didn't seem to get anywhere. So I had both of them come to the living room. The two sat on the couch and looked madder than two bobcats right face to face. This was not a fight to see who loved the other one most or anything like that.
I gave them the best piece of advice I could think of. As they turned to face one another, I told them I was not going to spank them for their actions. But instead the lesson they learned would hurt harder. I told them to tell each other one at a time that they were sorry. That they would not fight one another again. They had to hug one another and tell each other they loved one another. By doing this and letting them hug one another and tell each other they loved one another. By doing this and letting them hug one another. This broke the barrier and set up a new way for apologies.
To this date when one needs the other they are there for each other. A hard lesson in life is learned when both parents are not in their lives and simple apologies go a long way."

The harp’s melodic notes resonated in his mind.
Streaks of tangerine peeled over the horizon, arching overhead, resembling Egyptian linen embroidered with the golden threads of Ophir - draped across a mahogany table.
His thoughts easily flowed to his beloved library in pursuit of his scrolls, where the scribe had found so much security in the past - finding definition and purpose through the structure of language - the acquisition of knowledge. There, his introversy was hedged in by dusty tomes and the musk of vellum. The long hours spent perfecting the form and precision of the letters, the exactness of the process, illuminated by the alert flame of an olive oil lamp. Even now he sought its solace, but the stirring of his heart and the sea…
“Peace be still.”
An inclination towards the heart now dwelling within him. Could this be the reason for the supernatural dawn?
He allowed the harp’s permeating melody to capture him...like the man’s words. Just like the sun’s dazzling rays displayed amongst the effortless clouds, gliding in their golden splendor.
Could he really follow this man? The Messiah?
A seed had been planted deep in the soil of his soul; his spirit was responding - engulfing his heart.
High above the mirror smooth water an eagle soared on a thermal current.
“I can see it, Abba, way up there. I want to fly like that someday! The scribe’s son exclaimed from behind him.
In his meditations, the scribe had not heard his little footsteps approaching on the dock.
“Is this really what colors are?”
The sun’s warmth was finding them both, encompassing them
“Before I could see them, I dreamed heaven looked like this,” said the son.
“You can still see now, lad?” the scribe asked his son, who had found his way toward him and settled in his lap. “The man, Yoshua, really opened your eyes then?”
“Oh yes, Abba. I never knew life was like this before,” the son said wistfully. “I see the clouds and the sea - the beautiful sunrise - and I see you too, and myself.”
Looking down at the water to their reflection on the tranquil surface, father contemplated his son and the son his father. Resembling one another, they were an exact representation of the other - expressed in the form of a seed.
The scribe’s thoughts, again, followed after the man, only briefly, then paused. His son’s eyes searched for his own, as he stroked the coarse texture of his greying beard.
“Abba, will you teach me to know the letters and write like you?” His son inquired hopefully.
The scribe thought; finally, I will be able to impress upon my son the wisdom of the Torah and the revelation of the Hebrew language. The miraculous man had done much for him indeed. He spoke a silent prayer in thanks to the Most High as he lifted his son up onto his shoulders.
The hard’s chords began to cause ripples to stir upon the awakening sea. Glinting across the expanse of this ambition of nature was a radiant daybreak shimmer, bursting on the horizon, causing the Galil to come to life.
“Absolutely, my son,” with tenderness in his voice. “I have been waiting your whole life to hear those words.”"

They look so small.” The young lady kept on and on. Sure didn’t need to hear that. There was no way I was going to look over the edge. My knuckles were already white from my grip. Keeping my eyes level became a task. Once I see Fred again, he is going to get an earful.
Not once did either of us care about time. It seemed like hours since we left the ground, we floated along so slow. I believe a snail coated with Vaseline would pass us. I just had to ask, “Is this thing moving?” The pilot replied, “Sure we are. We are traveling at four miles per hour. One thing you don’t want is a head wind. It would affect our speed.” This was no help either. “How about a little more positivity on this trip?” “Sure”, he replied. “What would you like to talk about?” I knew that he sensed that I was afraid by the cracking in my voice.
The blimp shook as if someone had grabbed it in their hands. Now, I was about to spill everything I had eaten. “Oh my, you look a little green in your face. Do you feel alright?” She kept on and on, she probably thought she was helping. But it didn’t. I think I lost all of my blood Anything that had color to it had to be my feet.
When the pilot said “We are in trouble”, that pretty much put the icing on the cake. It lurched forward and started to drop. Right then, doom hit me and this is isn’t going to be pretty. For some reason, he had lost control of the blimp. No matter what he did, it just would not respond. Of all the things that could happen. Yeah, you guessed it. The woman had gotten hysterical and started to scream. My nerves were shot and before I could say anything to calm her down, the pilot reached over and let some helium out.
The nose of the ship started to rise. I was too scared to speak. The lady had fainted and hit the floor. I felt a little better after that. The poor pilot was busy trying to keep us in the air. He hadn’t noticed her. Several minutes passed before it started down again. He had some control but not a lot could be done.
The ground was coming up. But not too fast, as I could tell. The main thing was that my feet would be back on the ground. It hit with a thump. That is when the lady woke up. The pilot helped her out as I was already on the ground, kissing it.
Fred on the other hand didn’t fare too well. He wore a shiner for a while but we are still good friends. My fear of heights, you may ask? Lets just say that if I have to use a chair to change a lightbulb, I’ll stay in the dark."

Now I sit here rereading this, and although I miss you even more, I have this sudden inexplicable thought that I can’t seem to get rid of.
You are a selfish human being. I have been incarcerated now for over ten years. Isn’t that a long enough time for your little grudge party?

I have to watch what I say because even a simple “hello” can be misconstrued and lead to violence. Literally, it happens. I live in a hell where a hug can lead to a sexual misconduct report, where farts can lead to violence and bloodshed (also literally), where there are no secrets and friendship is a joke and a waste of time. Do you know what it’s like to not have a single friend in the world? I have no one to turn to, no one to confide in. Phone calls home are expensive (not to mention recorded) and I make a whopping thirty cents an hour.

Other than helping my own children with homework, I had no background in teaching and was nervous as a whore in a church when I was made responsible for instructing others so they could complete their mandatory literary lesson and GED requirements. Although there were a few bumps along the road for both me and my students, this turned out to be the most gratifying, ego-inflating experience of my life. Watching the sense of pride explode across the faces of my students as they accepted their certificate of completion (mandatory literacy) or their high school equivalency diploma was a thrill every time it happened. A few of those men could not even read when they entered prison. This shared sense of accomplishment with these few surpassed being the Super bowl winner’s quarterback.
In conjunction with my responsibility as a TA I was given the opportunity to formulate and offer a curriculum for a poetry workshop as a part of the adult enrichment program. Again, watching these men explore new horizons, develop inherent skills, or expand on prior knowledge was very rewarding. One student and I shared the joy of having poems published in the same issue of Cell Door Magazine.
As much as I hate prison, I owe a debt of gratitude to two proactive, dedicated staff educators for activating previously unrecognized talents in me. Now, that same sense of gratitude extends to the staff and volunteers at Prisoner Express for providing an outlet for my scribbled mental meanderings."

When will our nation figure out that we all desire the same dreams in life. FOr us, our children, our country, we are all headed in the same direction yet fight each other the entire way.
If only we would realize that there are zero differences in us no matter our age, race, religion, gender, sexuality, or political leanings, we all have more in common than not. In order for us to succeed as a nation we must get in tune with each other and tune out our differences until we learn that it's our different strengths that can work together for the overall good for all.
We need to all sit down and make a list of everything we value in life, and beside it everything we dislike. Then trade lists with your political or religious opposites. Then count off how many values you each have in common. I bet you have a two to one similarities to differences.
These differences are where you need to work on. Which ones can you live with for the sake of the greater good? Again it's reasonable to bet we could learn to compromise with each other for the sake of the greater good of our nation, state, community.
So this is the challenge to all of you - take a realistic assessment of yourself. Understand that the largest asset of America is its diversities. These diversities have made America the world’s leader in innovation. We shall surely fail as a nation if we do not get tuned in to what makes us the most powerful nation on earth.
We used to be the envy of the world. A country all other nations aspired to become. Not anymore. Now, the world looks at us with horror as we set out to destroy each other over the same diversity that once made us strongest.
Say goodbye to the American Dream unless we wake up soon. We have become our own worst enemy. Our enemies are gleeful at America’s demise at its own hands. You can thank a divided nation for the destruction of the American Dream and our Freedoms.
Respectfully yours,

At this present time my desire is to be successful and to be victorious over everything that wants to thwart me. I am looking to receive another chance to get on the other side of these penitentiary locked gates, and run as far as I can from ALL of these barbed-wire fences. I can’t ignore, neither can I deny this temporary existence. I’ve been temporarily thwarted. What about outside support, do you have anyone out there on the outside of these prison gates that cares about you and will help you in any shape, form or fashion? As for me, I am temporarily thwarted, being that I am the remaining few of a dying breed. Unfortunately, I am fifty-four years of age, and I am childless. I guess in that sense I am thwarted, since I have no seed to keep my heritage alive. I often wonder why and what might have been. Satan, most likely has laughed at me more than a thousand times knowing that I was unable to get any woman pregnant. He laughs at me not being able to produce children. His job is to kill and destroy, but Jesus came that I might have life and have it more abundantly. The story of my life is not over. I am more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus who strengthens me. Don’t you guys and girls lose hope like I did when I threw in the towel. I lost all my hope and desire to continue participating in the theme writing program. Keep your heads up, and stay in the game.
I have been locked up for a total time of six years, and the parole board keeps giving me set offs after set offs. Every time that I come up for parole, every single year for the last six years, it has been a one year set off. By all appearances, it appears as if I have been thwarted, and that I might as well just settle down and call this place home. I just don’t understand why the parole board is so reluctant to release me. Yeah, I’ve been back and forth here for a total of six different times which makes me a repeat offender. That however, should not give them the reason to make an attempt to continually thwart me, preventing me from making parole. The parole board treats us as if we’re cattle on the market to be sold. To me, it’s a big money market scheme. Why would they want to lose their meal ticket when they can keep their feet on our neeks? Big time thwart."

Amir considered speaking to them, but crushing disappointment stole the words from his lips before he could speak them aloud. He looked at his trembling hands in disbelief.
Each night, the Lord came to Amir in his dreams, and each night, He made the same request. “Lead my flock back into my loving embrace. Amir, my son,” the Lord instructed him. Each night, in those dreams, Amir received a different reward for his unquestioning servitude.
The first night he’d flown, soaring through the heavens above the vast city. It was wonderful--exhilarating. With each breath and dive through the swirling air currents, he felt the Lord in every pore, elevating him.
The second night, he was granted future sight when he saw his grandchildren, and their grandchildren. He swelled with pride, and never before had he felt so grounded in his own existence.
The third night, he was a spirit able to intrude upon anything and anyone without being seen. He visited the home of his ex-wife and watched her dine with his son and daughter. He wept then, too, and the love closed over him like a warm blanket on a cold winter’s night.
The fourth night, he found himself with a super strength. He went to different parts of the world where he was needed and saved people from the rubble after an earthquake. He torn a pregnant woman from the wreckage of her car after a drunk driver ran her off the road.
The fifth and final night, he had clairaudience, the ability to focus on hearing any sound, no matter the distance. He listened as good men planned and evil men plotted. He heard things that made him sure there’d never been a more important task than the one he was given in his dreams. He became convinced that it was up to him to save mankind.
Each morning, Amir awoke feeling like a new man. Knowing mankind would depend on him and that he was chosen by the Lord, he had quite a weight upon his shoulders. He was determined not to fail in this most sanctimonious task.
Returning his thoughts to the present, Amir thought of his dismal failure of the last four days. He tried with all his might, and how he was giving up. He knew he was wrong: they were just dreams, like all men have. Amir was left with no choice but to accept his normalcy. He trudged home to change his dripping cloak and maybe grab a bite to eat. As he walked, he thought to himself, “Let the Lord find another sucker.”
Leaving the sand, Amir looked down to see a dead bluejay on the side of the road. It was the most beautiful blue with white highlights and a black feather on its wings. Surely, only the Lord could make something so flawless and perfect.
Amir couldn’t bring himself to leave the bird to rot in the gutter, and so he decided to put it in his pocket and bury it when he got home. With cupped hands, Amir gently lifted it and looked closely with awe and wonder. Its feathers were riddled with dirt, and so he began to blow upon the bird. As he blew, his warm breath over the bird, he felt a sudden, heavenly surge upon his chest. Tears began to flow from his eyes as his breath continued to flow--surely his longest exhale.
Suddenly, the Jay began to pulse in his hand, and Amir continued blowing as it twitched and stirred. His breath began to run out, yet the Jay sprang to its feet in his hands before spreading its perfect wings into flight.
Amir watched the miracle bird until it disappeared from his sight. Then he fell to his knees and wept for the second time that day."

She’s very serious and purses her lips tight as she flails her arms and legs following my instructions. But, like a bull dog, she quickly sinks to the bottom as soon as I let her go. She won’t be discouraged, but as the crowds begin to arrive, we’re forced to take a break.
She’s wide-eyed and slack-jawed watching the teens splashy arrival off the steep water slides. “Daddy, can I?” But before I can answer she races off and jumps into one of the deep landing pools. For half a beat I’m frozen then instinct kicks in and I dive in after her. “What are you doing Cat!? You can’t do that!” Her shiny eyes tell me I’m louder and angrier than I should be. She simply, without a word, points to a corner of the pool. I seat her on the edge and wade over. I reach down and pull up a small black child no older than my Cat. He’s blinking hard and spitting up water. I’m staring at him in disbelief, “Are you ok? Where’s your mom?” I look around sure that there’s a parent somewhere frantically searching for him. He just continues to stare at me as I place him on the edge of the pool. His breathing has relaxed, he turns away and sprints off. I jump out of the pool, but I’m too slow to reach him as I lose him in the midday crowd. I can only hope he’s heading toward some adult supervision.
I reach for Cat, “You saw him and wanted to help?” She smiles and nods, like the lifeguards, she explains. “I’m proud of you,” I’m barely able to choke out as I give her a big hug and promise her a giant ice cream cone.
Summer of 2017
Cat’s up early. No breakfast today, she doesn’t want to be late for her first day at work. She recently completed the lifeguard course and will now be working at our community pool. “I’m proud of you,” I yell out, as again, I find myself holding back tears. I still see that little 5 year old with her bright pink floaties. She leaves before I can embarrass her further."

“The war’s over, Clem!” Great-grandpa would shout.
Clem simply would nod and then go right back to his old ways again.
“I reckon having the middle name of “Stonewall Jackson” made Clem feel he had to carry on the war,” Grandma said and shook her head. “But all the children were scared to death of him. I wouldn’t let nary a one of mine anywhere near that devil.”
If the old saying that people reap what that sow is true, then Clem had a load coming his way for a harvest!
Vigilante justice was not a new concept in South Carolina. No one to this day really knows who the culprit was or were, but when the body of Clem was discovered, about the only thing recognizable were the clothes he had once worn. And they were beat up pretty badly and soaked in blood. My Grandpa, David Williams, being the local sheriff, knew there was no point in questioning the folks around the farm because nobody “knew” anything. Even more important, nobody missed Clem once he was gone to that great field in the sky! The body was buried, but strangely, the clothes were buried just outside the barn.
“I think it had something to do with putting a hex on Clems’s spirit,” Grandma told me. “We had several ‘gitches’ around the farm who worked roots on people, and they must’ve been the ones who buried ol’Clem’ s clothes.”
It wasn’t long afterwards that strange things began to take place around the barn. Especially when a full moon was In. Word spread fast that the Jordan barn was haunted by the restless soul of Clem. Noone dared venture down the path to the barn after the sunset.
“The children would say ‘old bloody bones’ was in the barn,” Grandma laughed. “I couldn’t get one of my children to go down to the barn even to fetch the eggs from the hens. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t too pleased to have to go down there myself!”
Now it so happened that fall came a bit early one year. The depression was in full swing and times had been especially tough. The tobacco harvest had been a heavy one and it took every available pair of hands around the farm to help put it in to cure.
“Everyone of us, even me and the children, were working from sun-up to sundown to help put in that crop. We didn’t have time to even stop for a drink during the day,” Grandma said.
With everyone out in the fields, quite naturally, chores around the house took a backseat.
“We had completely forgotten about milking the dairy cow we kept down at the barn,” Grandma chuckled. “By the time we all got back to the house at night, poor ol’ Jasmine was bellering to beat the band!”
Jasmine was my Grandma’s milk cow. It was Jasmine who provided the farm with milk and butter which my own Mama learned to churn from the time she was able to stand. Not a day passed without the cow being milked or she ran the risk of her udder bursting. Jasmine operated like an efficient timeclock. If the day went by without anyone coming to relieve her of the “burden” then sure enough, old Jasmine would let out a deep, guttural “moo-o-o-o!” until somebody came to the barn with a pail!
Such was the in the autumn of 1932. Everyone had been out in the fields since sunrise and the need to milk Jasmine had just slipped the mind of Grandma.
Now the scare of the barn being haunted by the ghost of ol’ Clem had kept everyone away from the barn most of the time, even during the daylight. To go down the path to the barn at night was just unthinkable! But somebody was going to have to brave it or Jasmine wouldn’t survive the night.
“We laid up in the house listening to that cow for over an hour!” Grandma shook her head. “I couldn't bear to hear her suffer like that so I rounded up all my girls and said we were going to have to go to the barn and help Jasmine out.”
Grandma set off down the path to the barn with all nine of her daughters in tow.
“We were all walking arm in arm like a bunch of scared cats!” she laughed. “If we had heard a ‘boo’ I think we all would climbed a tree!”
Nobody stopped to think where my Grandma’s two sons had gone. It seems Uncles Kenny and Jay had just slipped out of the house unnoticed. So the last thing Grandma suspected was for anyone to be at the barn but Jasmine.
As Grandma and the girls neared the barn, a sight awaited them like never before.
“All of a sudden, this huge white think rose up from behind the hedges In front of us and you never heard such a sound!” Grandma said. “We didn’t none of us stop to think, look or give a second care about Jasmine. Everyone one of us just let out a yell and ran for the house!”
The “ghost” turned out to be none other than my Mom’s brothers, Kenny and Jay. As Grandma and the girls went running, Kenny and Jay fell Into fits of laughter, rolling around on the ground. The two had taken one of Grandma’s best sheets and attached It to cane poles. When the women came Into sight, they each took a pole and lifted the “ghost” up above the hedges and made noises to put a scare into the girls. Trouble was, Kenny and Jay were in for a little scare themselves.
“They didn’t stop laughing long enough to look over their shoulders,” Grandma said. “If they had, they would’ve seen Grandpa sneak into the barn.”
My Grandpa had seen what the two had done to Grandma and the girls so he felt that a little justice was In order.
“Grandpa found some old clothes In the barn that we kept for making scarecrows,” Grandma chuckled. “He took some red paint and smeared it on the clothes and put them on.”
Kenny and Jay didn’t see Grandpa walk up behind them. They were still too busy enjoying themselves. But when Grandpa let out a howl that would do any haunted house proud, the laughter ground to a halt.
“You never seen two more scared boys in all your born days!” Grandma laughed. “Them boys came running to the house like the devil himself was after them!”
Grandma put two and two together quickly. She realized that the “ghost” she and the girls had seen earlier was Kenny and Jay. Grandma didn’t know it was Grandpa who scared the boys, but figured that somebody had exacted justice for the scare they had given her and girls.
“Jasmine was still mooing up a storm,” Grandma added. “So I sent Kenny and Jay back to the barn to milk her!”
The boys were petrified to have to return to the barn after such a sight as old bloody bones himself. But Grandma would hear none of it. Needless to say, the ghost of ol’ Clem was kept alive and well for many years to come. I doubt that my uncles Kenny and Jay ever forget the night that their own “haunting” backfired and they became the haunted!"

Thankful
Everlasting episodes erupting rapidly
Exterminating all uncomfort & its totality
Memories of you accompanied with excitement energizes my existence
What once was has become foreign
With a dose of pain
Archives my actions
Authentic apologies articulated in ink
With the strength of my ancestors
Tames the temperature in which I reside
Free from the shackles of immaturity?
Hard work affords much respect
On bending knee for one last hug & kiss
With the permission to have your undivided attention
To look into your
Eyes
With courage and compassion
To say
“Thank you”
For being the reason & the one
For the re-creation of me
“Thankful”"

A modulator was added.This allowed me to plug in a microphone to talk to Midnight in an ultrasound voice which would not annoy the neighbors. It was a graceful addition.
Midnight never knew what bit him in his ear. He entered my back yard with disgraceful intent. From the public address speaker above my door emanated around fifty watts of ultrasound RRRRR-ARF! Attack bark. At the same moment my screen door slammed shut. Midnight was back in his own back yard before he even looked back. No snarling pursuits was seen. Sans snow, the “evocative dog photo” is a thought-provoking resemblance to the expression Midnight had on his muzzle.
A television movie that night gave me inspiration. The movies was set in World War 2 London during the blitz. Air raid horns moaned as another V-2 rocket was launched from the continent. Some quick work with my cassette tape recorded was duplicated to produce two minutes of audio. By the fifth replication, my tape had a full half hour of sirens that, gracefully, nobody except Midnight could hear.
At one in the morning ~ such a graceless hour fit for disgraceful deeds! ~ my ultrasound Tank began howling out its false warning of a rocket attack. No human heard the 1942 sirens that my Tank fired towards my neighbor’s house. There was no way for me to know if Midnight heard the ultrasound blasting his direction from my Tank... unless Midnight gave me the message in his own voice. Five silent minutes ticked off. From under the back bedroom window came a tentative: “Uh-uh-uh-roooo! Uh-rooooo!” From out of the window Shipwreck shouted a decision: “Shut up, Midnight!” The dog continues to sign for me. “Ruh-uh-rooooo!” This was the first verse of what could be a lengthy duet. “Uh-rooooo!” “Shut the hell up, Midnight!” “Rooo-ooo-ooo!”
My full revenge upon my neighbor’s dog took place at two fifteen. Shipwreck had yelled: “Shut up, dog!” more than 20 times. The hound obeyed only during intervals when my cassette tape was rewinding. On our third refrain, with my ultrasound tank hitting the high notes while Midnight sang along in key at audio range, there was a bellowing roar of a 39-caliber pistol as Shipwreck played percussion. My neighbor had been indirectly remote controlled to shoot his own dog. What an act of grace!
Midnight had his full revenge on Shipwreck. The cops investigated the 2:15 A.M. gunshot report. Midnight’s body was in plain open sight from the street. Shipwreck was arrested for the misdemeanor of Discharging a Firearm in City Limits, which caused his parole in a prior felony case to be revoked. Shipwreck was then charged with the new felony of Felon in Possession of Firearm. Shipwreck, fool as he proved to be, had shut Midnight up. Thereafter Shipwreck himself would be shut up in a place of no grace, here in Texas Department of Criminal Justice."

I came so far. So much I went through. I’m hanging onto the moment. I want to hold her. Tell her how much God loves her. Share some verses so she never forgets. I long to see my wife deep in my bones. This hurts so bad. I can feel she’s near. But I know that my daughter wants to impress me with her practice and ability.
I feel a shift coming. My wife over my shoulder too far to reach. I know she feels joy to see us together and she doesn’t want to interrupt. The shift is coming soon.
Please come over, I think hard as to will it if possible. I want to hug them both. The shift brings me to a new message, a new “reality”. Praise God in his infinite grace and mercy. Thank you God, just a bit more!
The timeline moves. I know I’ll go somewhere else in another layer of time and reality. I have to leave them again. Even if it’s prophetic and I’ll eventually wake up in prison.

He’s doing Bible studies and getting As. A+ guy with growth. So blessed to have a part in that. Others need prayer too. He’s my second longest running prayer to come back to God. I’m furthering the Great Commission as Jesus taught. The things I missed, all the wasted time on selfish endeavors. I know I could’ve been a statistic for the legal system. I could say I am now. Would you accept that? Could you? With everything wrong, 120.5 years? I really hope not. I’ll never stop trying to meet the problems in life. Even if they’re not mine. I yearn to call out to dry bones. We call out to dry bones come alive. If only you had the Holy Spirit moving in you, ACts 2:38. Nothing is impossible with God.

I had become a Class A obnoxious jerk. One night my wife had announced that she wanted to go visit a neighbor and that she would be gone for no longer that half an hour. Ten minutes after she left I followed her. I crouched behind a stand of bushes like a predator waiting for my unsuspecting prey to happen along. I watched as she walked down the sidewalk toward me, laughter bubbling up from my gut. Just as she passed, I grabbed her from behind, placing my hand over her mouth. I thought this was going to be my pièce de resistance, it was not. Her response scared me! She went stiff, then limp as if she’d fainted. I had frightened her to the core. I instantly realized my faux pas. Until this moment, I’d never stopped long enough to consider the consequences of my cruel sense of humor.
Patti later told me (much later since she didn’t speak to me for a week after that), the first thing that went through her mind was that she was going to be raped and killed, and she was worried about leaving me and our one year old daughter alone. I was dumbfounded. How could she ever forgive me? Well, I’m not sure that she ever has… We were divorced three years later. The joke was on me, and the laughter was over…"

As the sadness started to overwhelm my thoughts, I thought, “I’m thankful my children survived without me.” And I realized then, it was this power of being thankful which was missing. I never hear of news we are thankful for.
What has preserved my mind and heart during these long and lonely years has been periodically writing down all I’m thankful for. It is easy to make complaining, hatefulness and criticizing everyone and everything a habitual topic of our thoughts and speech.
After I was told I had fatal cancer 3 years ago, I discovered the power of being thankful. It heals our heart, mind and soul. When we list what we are thankful for, it changes our perspective on life. When we think of all there is to be thankful for, life, at this moment, doesn’t seem so bad.
When my mind is thinking on what I’m thankful for, I begin to feel happy and I begin to feel loved and this is something no one can take from me or not give me or hold back from me. I possess this power in each and every moment in all its fullness. Words cannot express how thankful I am for this power which is always with me at all times.
I can be thankful at anytime and all the time. No one can stop me. It doesn’t matter where I’m at. A superpower to call upon, which instantly appears to save the day. Because I’m thankful, my whole reality changes and nature responds by creating more reasons to be thankful for.
Imagine if our culture embraced thankfulness, would it change people? Maybe it would cure these poor souls whom have lost all hope and thankfulness to commit such desperate acts.
Thankfully, we can all use this power and seed it into our culture for real change to create better tomorrows. If thankfulness is a superhero, it’s sidekick is a smile. With those two, we can, “create nice days, make lots of smiles.”"

I still asked around if anyone may have lost him, but there were no claims. He stayed about a week until one day, he too vanished.
Then I went to court and then to county jail for the summer.
Years later, I once again found myself on the cusp of losing my freedom. Things were looking bleak, and I couldn’t manage my way out of a wet paper sack. Bad choices, drugs, booze, and lame relationships were all my world had to offer. So I saw the end of my freedom coming at a pace I couldn’t stop. No real friends, just those posing to be, and my options seemed to narrow each day.
Then it happened. Riding to the store for more beer, I noticed that down the busy main street, there he was running as if he were trying to blend into traffic, hanging his tongue out, keeping a steady gallop astride traffic, heading in our same direction, and occasionally peering over his shoulder as if waiting for us to catch up. We pulled into the station, and I called him. “Get over here!” He came right to me, jumping into the truck and mostly into my lap. He began to lick me with slobbery affection. He was a fullsize pitbull, red in color with clipped ears. He loaded up into the truck as if he did it all the time. When we got back to the house just around the corner, my friend’s wife saw the dog in the truck as were pulling up. She asked what we were doing with it since she just ran it off from the front yard a little while ago. It was as if the pooch had been looking for me first!
So I kept him around for a while. He was healthy, and maybe his owner would put up notice soon. He was easy to walk on a leash, never tugging and always minding his manners. He would even ignore the barking dogs… behind the fenced yards. At first, he would start to flare, but by simply telling him to “be nice,” he’d look at me with big, brown, wet eyes and blink before he continued walking. He had a habit of pooping in the street, even though he’d sniff around on the grass next to the curb and circle around a couple times. After doing that, he’d step out in the street and arch up on the asphalt. Passing motorists would look at me with disdain, and neither he nor I would care.
It was getting colder, and so I would let him in the house to stay warm at night. He kept me company as well, being the best listener possible to my rants or worries. Usually, he would sleep at my feet, not moving all night, and he would fart. They were probably the worst farts that I have ever been exposed to. When he did, he’d turn around and look at his rear like he couldn’t believe it came from him. Then he would look at me to see if I noticed. I did.
One night, I had left him outside, and in the morning, all that was to be found was the chain and collar. He was gone. Then I went to prison.
I reminisce on the companionship those strays provided when I, too, was lost. Maybe it was I who was found and tolerated by the only beings that could at the time. I was allowed to walk that path with their company, just as I was. Be it good or bad, they accepted me."

Instead, I became convicted of murder and was sentenced to life.
You may wonder, “Why?” It’s a question, however, that I do not recall anyone in the system asking as they guided me into the social role I now settled in, much like the brushers in the game of curling guide a sliding stone to its final resting place. Our parents, teachers, social workers, pastors, peers, even babysitters are the brushers in our lives, people whose influences determine the course of our lives, usually not consciously. (See, “Society Makes Its Criminal”, an August 2017 post on my blog - http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540/ - for more on that.)
Had my father been Pat Craig (founder of Colorado’s Wild Animal Sanctuary) and my mother Jane Goodall, I’d have had a clear pathway to growing up and becoming a zoologist or vet. Had I even had a stable home I might have been able to make my own path to these professions. But, my home was violent and abusive in many ways, both my stepdad and mom (I don’t know who my dad is) were mentally ill and my mom was a poly addict. My mother cut off all ties with our stabler extended family, and I’d lived in more than six states and 15 houses before I was 15 years old, so I had weak community ties/support.
While I’m not bitter about it, I observe that my childhood...desire was thwarted by circumstances I had no say in.
While in prison I’ve studied and grasped very well poetry, literature, psychology, cosmology, neuroscience, neurophilosophy, litigation, etc. The head shrink here scored my full-scale I.Q. as 144 on the WAIS-III. I could have been an at least competent… anything, which WI’s prison system still thwarts me from becoming.
This is a democracy, sorta, so it seems that the people have decided that they prefer to groom and permit the grooming of children for the social role of prisoner, and, once in this role, to keep us in this role. My wish was thwarted, but somebodies are getting what they wanted."

We quickly picked up this new method of smoking, and as a result, we were able to inhale normally in just a short time after. Weird!    Being so young it was hard to get cigarettes. I would raid ashtrays, pickup butts off the ground, steal them… I became an expert at stealing them from grocery stores. If I got caught, I would start crying and say my brother made me do it. This usually worked. As I got older (10 to 12), I found it easy to steal anything if I was careful.
I was not unpunished for my delinquency. My parents tried to stem my smoking with physical beatings, loss of privileges… I was even forced to smoke packs of cigarettes at a single sitting until I got so sick I couldn’t continue. The last couple of times I got caught, I was forced to eat a cigarette. Nothing worked. That was when I was 13. After that, I was left alone.
By the time I turned 16 years old, I was smoking a pack a day. I never let myself exceed this amount. If I did, it was because I gave out too many. At around this time I started getting locked up and couldn’t smoke. But I always started again when I was released.
I graduated from juvenile detentions only to be in prison within the year. Smoking was allowed back then (1987), but in the 90’s, smoking was prohibited in the institutions I was placed. I would still smoke whatever smuggled cigarettes came in and always smoked when I got out. As you can imagine, I “quit” several times. I always started again.
Finally in 1994, I met my future wife, Melanie. WIth her help, I was able to truly quit. It was hard at first, but I haven’t had a cigarette since Easter weekend 1994. Twenty-one and a half years ago! I’m proud of this success.
It amazes me what people do to their bodies. I started in 1973 to slowly kill myself with cigarettes (and other vices). But I’m still here 42 years later. I believe it’s because I stopped smoking when I did."

“What, you didn’t hear me, boy?” he said standing inches over me. I wasn’t scared of him at all. I came from a school where 10% out of the 85% of black kids carried guns to class. Crash was a joke to me but I didn’t want trouble so I came up with a plan.
“Look, Hillbilly. How ‘bout I pay you 50 bucks to leave these guys alone for...a month,” I propositioned. Benny, Mathew and Travis were taken aback as they stood with only a dollar or two in their hands. Crash seemed confused.
“You’ve got 50 bucks?” Crash asked me.
“Only if you chill-out on these guys.”
“50 bucks to lay-off these geeks for 30 days?” I pulled out the bill.
“Yup,” I said emotionless.
Crash shook his head with a puzzled frown but in the end took the money and told the boys--”see you dweebs in 30.”
After that the boys introduced themselves with gratitude and I told them my name.
A couple of days later into summer break I received a random visit from the boys. My mother was all smiles to see some kids finally coming over. I myself was confused as to what they wanted but also a bit cheerful that my boredom was cut short.
The boys said they wanted to hang out. They offered up “outdoorsy” activities that didn’t sound too fun to a “city-boy” like me so instead I invited them up to my attic-suite of a room where we played PS1, Nintendo 64, looked at some girly mags and chatted about our lives until evening.
After that first day together we were together almost every single day that summer. Benny, Mathew and Travis admitted that they weren’t in the company of many black people but assured me that they weren’t racist...and I believed them. By the end of the summer we forged a bond like no other and our dreams for the future included one another. We were friends. We were brothers.
What really made us close was when Crash finally showed back up demanding “bully-money” I unleashed a can of “woop-ass” upon him in front of the entire 9th grade body. Yes I was given 10 hours after school detention, but it made me popular, stopped the bullying and made my boys proud.
“Today we honor our buddy Donte for slaying the Crashinator…” Travis said, “...we celebrate with smokes as we cross over as men amongst children.” He handed each one of us a cigarette. None of us had ever smoked. “No-no-no,” I waved taking Mathew’s camera, “I’m already a man. Let me be the one to capture this most...transmatic moment in history.” The boys huddled up, put their cigs in their mouths and smiled as I snapped their picture.
That was in the summer of 1999...when we were young...and innocent.
15 years later we don’t see each other too much. We’ve all moved away. Benny lives in Miami-Florida where he runs a nightclub for “gentlemen.” We speak here and there over the phone. Mathew moved to New York where he works as a Journalist for the online-times. He lives with his husband of 2 years. I attended the wedding, but we don’t speak as much these days.
Travis moved to California where he runs a tech-firm. He’s rich, has a wife and two kids and has a slight drinking problem. We keep in contact the most.
As for me, I fell on hard times after high school. Picked up some bad habits and landed in the state pen. I’m out now. I wrote a novel that was loosely based on my time in the small of Anna. The book went viral online through E-books, and I’m now in Aspen-Colorado writing my next one.
The picture I took of my friends sits on my desk as a constant reminder of the youthful years of time past. I smile sometimes and reminisce...on the way we were."

Well, after a week of nasty weather you will be so grateful for the sunshine. And you don’t see much behind the scenes because the media only likes to broadcast the worst of everything. Communities come together and help restore. Americans come from all over to show their love, generosity, and support. Skin color, racism, hatred and anger go out the window when we need each other.
Families who haven’t seen each other for years might now depend on each other. Some people learn about life and find who they are. It’s all about perspective. Many find that spirit of a little kid who goes out and plays in the rain or snow. When I was a kid my friends and I loved to get out there and see the adventure in the eye of the storm.
Here in Florida, storms are followed by sunshine. Sometimes we have to go through a bad day to remind us what a good day looks like. That way we can learn to appreciate it. Don’t overlook your good days because tomorrow you might be wishing you can wake up from a bad dream.
Bad days bring good days and really bad days bring really good days. It takes a rainy day to water a field of wildflowers. Once it’s over, they bloom, and bring beauty to the world. Fog can blind us from what’s in front of us, but once it’s gone, we can see the beauty in front of us and appreciate it.
I’ve been in prison for thirteen years now and before this I didn’t appreciate anything. I cheated on all my girlfriends. I spent all my money on drugs, alcohol, clothes, and shoes. And I forgot my family even existed. Prison has taught me to appreciate so much.
I was inspired to write this tonight in solitary confinement as the officer passing out mailshot passed my door for the fourth night straight. If you’re anything like me, mail means a lot. I’ve been in solitary for thirty-eight days now for something I didn’t do. All in the same day that I was placed in solitary I lost my phone calls, canteen privileges, and visits for a year for possession of a cell phone- something I didn’t do. It all came down on me at once.
I’m also fighting for clemency so I can get out of prison, and for the last thirteen years motions and appeals have been denied. My release date says May of 2040, but I’m not going to let it keep me in out of the storm. “Hell no.” I’m gonna have the spirit of a kid and get out in the midst of it.
God doesn’t hate you or me. If anything the devil hates us because of our good, and wants to tear us down. We don’t have bad luck either, we just don’t see the outcome and the beauty of our current situation. Don’t make circumstances worse by getting depressed or angry. It’s not going to do anything except dig you a deeper hole.
A beautiful sunny day is to follow, so if you’re one of these people having a really bad day, prepare yourself, because something really good is about to happen for you. The sun is about to shine, or the rain is about to cool off a really hot one."

Some spend so much time there in one bar or another that they have become known as “regulars.” The only thing regular about going to bars beside making the owners rich is that nothing positive comes from going to them. On the other hand many negatives come from going to bars such as:

You lose your money
You get into fights
You get drunk
You try to drive drunk
You don’t spend time with family
You meet the wrong kind of people
You end up in jail
You go home and cause family arguments

Let’s face it: drinking alcohol, whether beer or liquor for mixed drinks, is consumed for its effects it has on the body which can act as a

Depressant
Stimulant
Impairment

Drinking can cause disorientation, enebrated, slurred speech, even uncontrolled bodily functions and blurred vision!
The reason they choose the bar is because everyone there is also there for the same or similar reason, mainly to drink!
Many blame it on all kinds of reasons as previously listed, but it comes down to the life-style they have chosen for themselves to live! They have chosen to go to the bar and drink for their problems instead of going to the Church and the Bible!

He returned to the swim.
It felt like a long time later, but he felt strength returning to his limbs. He lifted his head from the water and laughed, then dove under the surface. He kept his direction toward the pier, but he began to play in the water. Leaping and diving again, rolling in eel-like undulations, breaching the surface to laugh again. That burst of energy and giddiness carried him the rest of the way. He pulled himself onto the planks and collapsed, his muscles suddenly as fluid as the ocean he was just swimming.
He lay there a while before he gathered the strength to sit up and look around. It had been morning when he started and now the sun was well into afternoon. He was hungry, but with nothing to do about that, he shelved it in the back of his mind.
The pier was strangely unweathered. Each plank was buttery smooth, golden wood with the faintest graining. It stretched off into the distance, giving no clue what lay beyond. He looked back to the beach. The crowd had dispersed long ago, leaving only a few solitary watchers to see if he made it or not. He had gone too far to turn back now. A few would-be heroes drowned, others gave up or grew so tired that the current and tides carried them back to the beach.
The salt had dried on his skin. Jacob stood and stoically began to walk. The sun burned his skin, he was tired and thirsty and hungry. He was beginning to wish he’d stayed on the island, had never set out to seek destiny. Still he walked. There was only the pier, the endless water around it, and the sun.
He kept walking. Slowly, the sun sank and twilight set in. The first star showed itself. The smooth wood of the pier was easy on his bare feet, but his muscles still felt flaccid after the long swim. He was on automatic, walking only because there was nothing else to do.
As night set in, Jacob saw a light. He began to hear the gentle sound of waves rolling in on a beach. Both were still far off and he thought he was imagining them. He kept walking. The hallucinations refused to fade.
As the sun rose, he saw the end of his road. A small peninsula jutted out to meet the pier. Two trees framed a square shack, and more concrete created retaining walls enclosing several small garden plots. An ornamental waterfall poured into the ocean.
His step quickened. He left the pier and began to mount the concrete steps that wrapped around until they led to the shack’s single door.
Inside was a table, a bed, and a stand with a pitcher and basin to use as a sink. A mirror, bright and polished, hung above it. An older man sat at the table, a cigar burning in a crystal ashtray and a cane leaning beside him. He paused in the act of taking a drink from his glass when Jacob’s shadow darkened the doorway. “You’re from the island, then?”
Jacob could only nod, his mouth parched and salt-dry. His eyes hadn’t left the man’s glass, though the smell of coconut and alcohol stung his nose even from the door. Dazed, Jacob wondered where he’d got rum when neither of the trees outside were coconut.
“Of course you are. Nobody else comes here. Let’s get you fixed up. Welcome to Waystation.” He said the last with a flourish as a top hat appeared and rolled down his arm to his hand. He put it on his head with a sly grin and then used the cane to lever himself up.
Jacob followed him stupidly as the man filled three tin buckets in the waterfall. “Here, hold these,” he said as he handed two to Jacob. The weight tottered him and nearly pulled him to the ground. Again, the man grinned, a mocking edge to it. “That journey takes a lot out of you, doesn’t it?” He led Jacob to a wooden stall behind the shack, where another bucket hung. This one had holes in the bottom, allowing the water to shower down. Jacob turned his fact to it, then let it run into his mouth. He spit to clear the salt from his mouth, then drank mouthful after mouthful of the cool, sweet water.
After the first bucket ran dry, the man handed Jacob a rough cloth and a gray bar of soap. “I’m sure I’ve got some clothes inside that will fit.” These turned out to be denim pants and a homespun shirt. It scraped against his sunburned shoulders.
Once he finished the shower, Jacob returned to the shack to find a sandwich with a glass and pitcher set out on the table. Condensation beaded the pitcher’s sides. He ate and, at the man’s urging, laid on the bed. He fell asleep instantly.
When he woke it was dark again. He stood and stretched, then caught a delicious aroma as he yawned. He went outside, where a small fire kept the stewpot above it at a steady boil. The man saw him and beckoned him over. “It should be—” He tasted it with a long spoon. “Ready.” He handed Jacob a tin plate and spoon, then ladled a generous helping onto it once Jacob had sat down.
“What is this place...this Waystation?”
“It’s a place where heroes can rest and recover before they set out on their quest.”
There was no more conversation as they ate.
Then, Jacob asked, “So where do heroes go after this?”
That mocking grin flashed briefly in the firelight.
“Wherever destiny leads him.” After that, he refused to answer any more question, saying that he was going to sleep and, since Jacob had his bed all day, it was only fair that he would have it all night.
The next morning, Jacob woke to see the man with a packed bundle tied to a long stick. “Where are you going?”
“Where my destiny leads me.”
“But, I’m the one supposed to be doing that.”
The old man shook his head ruefully. “Don’t they teach the rules anymore? Here’s how it is. I was caretaker of Waystation. Now you’ve come to relieve me of that duty and free me to seek my destiny. You’ll be caretaker until the next hero comes along.”
“But that could be twenty years! What am I supposed to do?”
The man spread his hands, a doleful expression on his lively face. “It could be. Or it could be tomorrow. In the meantime, tend the gardens. Eat the fruit from the trees. The birds will provide you with eggs and, if you’re quick and clever enough, you can eat the birds. You’ll do okay.”
“If I wanted to tend gardens, I could have done it back on the island.”
“True.” The man shouldered his bundle.
Jacob thought quickly, looking for a way to leave. Then, an old story gave him the perfect answer.”Care to bet on it?”
The man lowered his bundle to the floor. “A wager? To see who goes and who stays?” Jacob nodded. “What’s your game? Dice?” He rattled a cup that was suddenly in his hand.
“Too much chance involved. Your hands are too quick for that.” That elicited another edged grin. Jacob asked, “How about chess?”
The man shook his head. “Too rigid. Not enough chance involved.” He grinned widely. “But I know.” He pulled a chess set from his pack and a deck of cards from his pocket. Once the board was set up and they’d used a hand-guessing game to determine that Jacob would play black, the man began sorting out cards.
“Now, there are six different kinds of chess pieces.” He laid out all four kings and queens, then the two jokers, then the aces, twos, threes, fours, and fives. “So we assign a type of card to each piece, with pawns getting both the aces and deuces.” He returned the remainder of the deck to his pocket. “Shuffle those and deal us each five cards. Threes are rooks, fours are knights, and fives are bishops. Jokers are wild. Draw from the deck and discard one that represents the piece you’re going to play. Red cards are white, black cards are black. You can move your opponent’s pieces if you play a card.”
Jacob thought for a moment to be sure he had the rules down, then smiled. “Just the right mix of chance and strategy.”
“A crossroads of sorts.” He drew, played a red two, and moved his own king’s pawn.
Jacob responded, playing an ace and moving one of his own pawns.
The game took three days as each checked his hand to see what moves were available and then studied the board to see which would be most advantageous. They paused to eat, but not to sleep. When they ran out of cards to draw, they took turns shuffling the discard pile.
“Checkmate.” Jacob rubbed his gritty eyes after he moved his final piece into position and declared the win.
“Well done.” The man slid everything into his pack and shouldered it again.
“But I won. Where are you going?”
A jaunty grin. “Jacob, you’ve done something extraordinary. Just like the hard journey here was a test, so was this. You could have just waited until I was out of sight and went your own way. But you didn’t just break the rules set by the status quo. That lies the way of the villain. You chose to do what a hero would; you changed the rules and pushed them beyond what you were told was possible. You risked your destiny, or so you thought, but in doing so you were truly setting out to find it. Even had you lost, I would have told you all this. We both would have left Waystation.”
“But who will be the caretaker?”
He chuckled. “This old place can take care of itself. It has done so long before either of us came here. It will tell its secrets to the next person to come here.” He handed Jacob a pack, similar to his own but smaller. Together, they stepped out. Jacob swung shut the wooden door, made of the same golden planks as the pier, and the old man slid the bar in place to hold it.
“But you did win. I could say the wager is null, but I’ll give you something equally valuable to what you thought was at stake. My name is Eshu Elegbara. Just once, you can say it at any sort of crossroads. I’ll hear and come to your aid.” Before Jacob could respond, Eshu tipped his hat and set out along a path, whistling a happy tune and not seeming to need his cane."

Being a biology teacher and a lawyer who handled high profile sexual abuse cases, I am freer talking about human bodies in general and my own in particular than most American adults are, but some PE theme prompts give me pause.

Since I had been allotted so many privileges for beyond what a young person such as myself should have, I decided to test the waters a bit deeper. I approached my pop’s wife (the only mother I ever knew) with the dilemma of this curfew. Mind you, each and every license wielding individual present was currently seven sheets to the wind. Another dilemma. But of course, I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t have a solution.
“Momma, let me get the keys. We gotta take Amber and them home thirty minutes ago.”
Of course, she was extremely reluctant to do so. There wasn’t enough vodka in the world to shroud her judgement on a matter such as this. No way in America was she going to place truth of this sort solely in me. Since we are starting to become familiar, you know that I had a solution for that too.
“Ma, Bryan (a family friend) said he would ride along to ensure that everything goes accordingly.” I highly doubt that I said “accordingly”, but you get what I’m getting at. Although skeptical skill, this did the trick and she gave in. Out the door I went, keys jingling in hand.
The part about Brya agreeing to accompany us was factual and the four of us sat in the car for several minutes waiting on him to join us. All the way until I grew tired of waiting on him. Back then I hadn’t yet learned the virtue of patience. Plus I was anxious to wheel the car. I pulled off without him.
It was a short drive to their place, only a couple hundred feet of main road between the two trailer parks. While dropping them off the older brother, Brandon, wanted to come back with me and stay the night. I said cool.
The two of us began the short trip back. I had a left hand cigarette rolled up and put fire to it. A few puffs later I passed it to Brandon. I pulled into my trailer park. Turned the radio all the way up. Slammed the accelerator to the floor. Get it up to about 50-55 mph before catching a glimpse of oncoming headlights. I jerked the wheel to the left. Sudden impact. Brandon’s head thrashed the windshield. Both of us entered a consciousness of eternal silence and darkness.
Several moments later I came back to. Brandon didn’t. Blood was everywhere. Oh boy. You know you messed up, right? I yelled his name and shook a single shoulder violently. No response. Oh boy. Yep, definitely messed up. I opened my door and stepped out. The pressure on my right foot sent an inexorable pain up the length of my leg. I ignored it. Adrenaline’s credit due. I dragged Brandon out of the car. Eventually, he came to. My fear dissolved. He wasn’t dead. Thank goodness! You still messed up though. I looked at the car. The entire front end was smashed. The transmission was sitting in the cab. Oh boy. Flashing lights were everywhere. Every intoxicated mind instantly sobered up.
The Jernigan’s Christmas Eve party was moved to the emergency room at Duke University Hospital. In the end all became well but oh boy, what a close call."

I loved studying all the different designs and colors covering each plate. It was like each plate took on its personality based on the personality of its owner. An angry red design went to an uptight uncle while a soft pink plate went to a gentle girl cousin. A golden swirl belonged to an inquisitive soul like me, while a plain white China plate when to my silent and studious grandfather. It was cool to see when the plate and its owner’s personality matched, but more importantly, the quicker the plates were washed and dried, the sooner we would eat!
I loved my plate almost as much as I loved my super happy Irish Setter. While the dog and I were inseparable companions, the plate and I shared many a spectacular holiday meal together. Still, a bad memory occurred every now and then. I remember one year I bumped my plate against the marble countertop and chipped the edge. When I saw the damage done, I sat down on the white tile floor and cried.
Maw-Maw came over and quickly assessed the situation. “Don’t worry,” she said, “We’ll get you another plate.”
“No,” I stubbornly said, “This one’s mine.” I hugged the chipped plate against my chest and thought of how some friends at school made fun of me because I had trouble writing words. I spelled well in my head, but on paper my letters always seemed to end up in the wrong place. Nobody knew what was wrong, so my friends just called me dumb.
“This plate’s broken just like me,” I told Maw-Maw.
“No sweetie.” She pulled me into her arms. “You’re not broken. You’re absolutely perfect just the way you are.”
The years passed and I proved that I wasn’t so perfect after all. In 1989, at the age of 16, I was on my way to prison. Still, even in my absence, every major holiday Maw-Maw unwrapped my plate, washed it clean, and sat it on the table in remembrance of me.
“I’ll always make your plate as if you’re there,” she told me at a prison visit before she got sick.
“But I’m not there,” I argued. “Just toss it in the garbage. They way it looks, I’ll never make it home anyway.”
“Yes, you will,” she soothed. “When God wills it, the doors will open.”
It’s now twenty-six years later. Maw-Maw has passed away, and the prison doors remain tightly closed. Still, come the holidays, I know I am loved because my mom carefully pulls the family’s plates from her corner cabinet and folds the plastic wrapping into neat little squares. Once washed, the plates are set on the table and piled high with delicious turkey and smoked ham.
“Mom,” I said a few years ago, “why don’t you just break my plate?”
“You’ve got to learn to understand love,” she told me. “If I break your plate then it’s like I’m giving up and saying that it’s all over. I don’t believe that for a second. Your life is far from over. On the other hand, when I make your plate, I’m declaring to God and the whole world that I know one day soon, my son is coming home. So, I will never break your plate. I will always make your plate, knowing that one day you will sit at my table and eat from it.”"

But he is a practical, greedy politician, and such he understands the usefulness of America’s largest I.R. group, Fundamentalist Christians (F.C.s). He is so committed to using F.C.s that he made their arch-zealot, Mike Pence, his V.P.
If we were in Saudi Arabia, Trump would use Sunni Muslims. His Sheiky counterparts do just that.
The problems with fascism are very self evident (what fool wants to live in a land where they’re merely the state’s expendable pawn?), so I’ll focus on proud ignorance and I.R.s.
Part 2
The core problem with I.R.s is that there’s no way to test the validity of its preachers’ dictates, short of demanding miracles to prove God’s behind them. But even demanding miracles, as the Jews reportedly did of Jesus, is held against potential believers, deemed, ironically, proof of weak faith or bad character.
Some will claim that an I.R.’s scripture (e.g. Torah, Bible, koran) can be used to verify whether or not a preacher is truly preaching God’s words. But, as can be seen in the Christian I.R., scripture has been constructed in many outrageously contradictory ways, which is why there are hundreds, thousands of different sects. Consider, for example, that based on their scriptures:

Some Baptists march with signs screaming “God Hates Frogs!” while others have LGBT ministers;
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that blood transfusions or eating blood sausage is unforgivable, which most christians don’t even think about;
Some Mormons believe polygamy is commanded, others believe it’s condemned;
Some Jews believe there’s an afterlife, others believe in none;
Some Muslims believe it’s okay to beat and completely oppress women, others deem that an insult to Islam.

You can find tens if not hundreds of thousands of books that cite pages of scriptures justifying these and other contradictory interpretations of those I.R.s’ scriptures (E.g. see Deceptions and Myths of the Bible, by Lloyd Graham).
By the way, those who fall for faith healers and the like ought to read The Truth About Uri Geller, by James Randi, and google Randi’s appearance on the Johnny Carson Show to see how those charlatans’ scams work. Mr. Randi exposed peter Popoff, then a famous healer.
The core irrationality - the danger, as will be explained - of I.R.s is that they put their God before other people, a God envisioned by one person(s)1, then reconstructed within others’ conceptions of reality2 (yes, telephone game… ). Such a deo-centric value system endangers all humans. For example, if “God” wishes, as ISIS and innumerable other zealots have shown us, any of us may be oppresses, tortured, or killed. (This now happens with F.C.s supporting the Prison Industrial Complex (P.I.C.), preaching against global warming, inciting trump to put our embassy in Jerusalem, steadily fighting against women’s “right to choose,” etc.)
People generally “test” the validity of I.R.s based on whether or not the I.R.’s doctrines appeal to their own beliefs and values, mostly subconscious beliefs and values. As Adolf Hitler said, somewhat: “people believe what they want to believe.” (See The Psychology of Superstition, by Gustav Jahoda for a thorough narration of why people believe in religions.)
You may cite examples of, e.g. gay F.C.s or women in ISIS, to say that believers believe even if it hurts them, because what they believe is true. But all those examples prove is the existence of masochist delusions and the complex, awesome, tragic abilities of the human mind.
Attempts to test the validity of an I.R., as I do here will get a person labelled an infidel enemy of Allah or the anti-christ, resulting in anything from your looks to your murder.
So, I.R.s are immune to reason, thus it does often result in the harm of believers or others, including:

Mass suicide via poisoned Kool-AidTM;
Giving away money, property, life’s time;
Disowning children,beating children;
Self hatred
Supporting politicians who oppress people

So, the dangerousness of I.R.s are many and great.
The problems with proud ignorance are revealed by an experience I had with a Pentecostal preacher. He dumped a used can of oil in the ground, 100 feet from his church’s well, “reasoning” that “Jesus is coming back soon. He’’ be here and fix everything before the water’s polluted.”
Mike Pence too is a good example of proud ignorance. His F.C. beliefs make him proud - God’s on his side, after all - and he believes the planet is less than 7,000 years old, that gays can be straightened out with therapy, etc.
Any politician, Trump too, realizes the beauteous tool tat F.c.s are. They’ve been trained by their shepherds to obey the government, based on Romans ch.13, a scripture written to those in one of the original fascist regimes, the Roman Empire. All Trump’s had to do is toss some bonse to F.C.s tweet-ban transexuals from the military, boast about usuing the word “christmas,” try to bring about Armageddon by putting our embassy in Jerusalem (F.C.s believe that Jesus will come back when the world attacks Israel… ), all while gutting the Dept. of Agriculture and starting a trade war that will result in massive harm to the very proud ignoramuses - rural F.C. voters - that are Trump's core supporters!
It’s so crazy I gotta laugh: ain’t gonna cry about idiots who dance in minefields.
What’s sad is the harm that will continue to be caused to innocents by Trump's polygamous marriage to Inspired Religion, Fascism, and Proud Ignorance.

Notes:

Temporal-lobe epileptic seizures are well-known causes of mystical religious experiences, including speaking to God. Schizophrenics also often talk to God.
As explained in Daniel J. Siegel’s The Developing Mind, we all construct unique conceptions of the nature of reality, which must include characteristics and personality of God

Walking past the bottom of Ozark on the other side of Imperial Avenue from my usual hanging, banigng and slanging area which was in the view of the fire station. I looked up and seen my relatives car it was a gray older model Ford with dark tinted windows. As I got closer I noticed he was leaning up against it. While speaking to a pretty girl. Once I was right in front of him I shook his hand and said, “What are you doing over here relative?” He answered; “Over here at a graduation party before I leave to college tomorrow morning.” I asked him what college he was going to? He told me; Cornell University in New York, he told me he was going to be a surgent one day and he’d be the first balck brain surgent with a tattoo on his scalp which he planned to get once he made it. He asked me if I wanted to go inside the party, which I declined due to the fact I was carrying a pistol plus I was not dressed good enough for his crowd (Nerdy Jocks and Mack Players)
So I began walking up to the top of Ozark and when I reached Holy Street I made a detour over to my homegirl Jackie’s house, we talked on her back porch for hours. I showed her the 38 cal which I then noticed had some kind of lock on the trigger area that I didn’t have keys for. After we scammed, I went to the Zark, looking for some homies and a smoker who knew how to take off the lock. Instead I found Daina, a grown sexy older homegirl who had a reputation of robbing swauvy’s (sailors) she got me drunk off some rum and coke they gave me some taco shop money and told me to go home after I got a bit in my stomach. She said be careful walking home because in the summer it’s killing season when anyone gets caught slipping, they’re ah gonnah. Well instead of spending the doe on carne asada fries I kept it for the bus fare I’d need the next morning. I left Ozard on my way to Big Cappies apartment on Gloria Street. Which is a short yet dangerous walk due to being completely exposed the whole way there. I arrived there tired and hungry. Cappie let me in and I let him know what was up. He asked me for the pistol to hold until I was ready to leave in the morning once I gave’em the pistol he handed me two blankets and a comforter plus four microwave burritos. I ate and passed out. Waken up around 9:40 that Saturday morning to rasta music and weed smoke densely in the air. Cappie said “Here hit the irie then eat the pancakes and eggs I just fixed because I got some things to do.” After smoking the Dunker weed Cappies was always having I cleaned up myself in his restroom, grabbed the pancakes and eggs and poured a healthy amount of syrup on them both situated on a paper plate, then asked for the pistol back on my way out the front door which he gave to me and asked me if I wanted to be dropped off anywhere? I replied yes, the Euclid Trolley station. Once he dropped me off, I was waiting for a bus that is when I was approached by this dude I went to school with, he was a pretty boy and I didn’t like him even though he’d never did anything wrong to me. His name is Jay R. Jay R said: “did you hear what happened last night? Someone shot and killed a wrestler who just graduated from Lincoln Prep High School at some party?” I asked him, “What was the boy’s name who got killed?” Jay R said “I believe it was Willie” I could not process anything else. So I ran the phone bank, picked up a phone pai and started dialing my mother’s number. When she answered her receiver crying, I knew my hero and relative Willie James Jones Jr. had been murdered at the party I had seen him at the night before ‘believe it or not.’
In the many years since Ozark Street was renamed Willie James Jones Blvd. in his honor, a wrestling tournament is named in his honor, a POTUS collected shoes in his honor, a scholarship is given in his honor and Cornell University graduated him honorarily. So when I write to your essay writing program and know at least one student will read it, I know my relative is also reading it through each and everyone of you. Because your programs are his way of telling me “reli I caught the flight and made it and I want to hear from you” Believe it OR NOT!

By questioning the validity of a problem, one gains the advantage of stepping outside of set limitations and opening new possibilities. The problems Yang was facing were not how to survive being as a prisoner or what to do once being held hostage, but rather whether or not he should continue to fight or allow himself to quit.
It may appear as nonsense or skillful semantics, but it is far from either. Once being captured, an easterner has a choice of being a prisoner or finding an alternative. Western point of view skips over this possibility due to its solution-ocentric nature. Western thinking teaches an acceptance of the given premise. Once you have accepted the problem as presented, you are bound by its restrictions. Replacing Yang for John from California, his journey would stop as a Russian prisoner.
Perhaps this is what Yang’s story illustrates: western thought is constrained, while eastern thought is boundless. Life is a changing thing, in a constant state of flux. There is little linear in it. Eastern perspectives are fluid in nature. One still maintains first prerogative in eastern doctrines. Perhaps this is why Yang was never just another P.O.W. statistics?"

There's no sign of any human presence and no boat. But there's plenty of driftwood about, so I gather some together and construct a make shift ""raft"" with some rope I find in my pack.
Skeptically I push it in the water and to my surprise, I make it to the island-soaked, tired, and hungry, but alive.
I pull myself and the raft shore looking around. Everything has a film of ancientness to it: the beach, the sparse vegetation, the three trees, and what looks like a manmade entranceway to a cave dwelling or crypt. Hopefully, the former.
My first inspection leads me to find a spider-infested cave with signs that it was once inhabited by another fellow human. There was a chamber approximately 15' by 16' and about 6 ft high, a hollowed out shelving along the back wall big enough to use for a bed, a broken chair carved out of stone, and a rotting driftwood table. The ground is fairly flat and the walls are smooth except for the few storage shelves and some writing and pictures carved in the rock. A family of mice seems to have made a nice home for themselves in the back corner of my future bed-platform and likewise, other animals seem to have taken refuge in this cave. Since I myself qualify as a refugee, I should fit right in. With a few fixes, replacement of the furniture, eviction of the homesteaders, and cleaning, it will be perfect.
While fixing everything up and doing a good cleaning, I search the rest of the island. I find a small spring not far behind the cave entrance flowing into a pool. It's surrounded by two lemon trees, a eucalyptus tree and some wild grapes. Other than these, the island is desolate, roughly shaped and small enough to be traversed in the time it takes the sun to move a quarter hand-span.
A fortnight after arriving I float my reinforced raft back to the mainland and walk for two days up the coast before I come to a fishing village. Making friendly, but vague inquiries into the local area, I barter for a few garden seed, a couple of goats, and a few chickens. As I make conversations with these locals, I find out that my island doesn’t exist! There isn't a single soul who can confirm that there is an island two days walk to the south. Not only no island, but none of them have even heard of a bay either!
It's been six years since then and the island's claim on me. Its locality doesn’t exist so I'm quite safe from discovery. I love it here. The chickens and goats seem content and are surprisingly good company. The garden has flourished, the lemon trees produce big lemons, the grapes are plump and juicy, and the eucalyptus tree provides shade and medical aid need be. The weather is never too bad, and under the island's influence, I find myself content. With the cave's entrance facing the west, I enjoy the sunsets in comfort, like how I am now.
Every year at this time, the tree leaves rustle and blow away, dusk falls early and the temperature drops to near freezing at night. I watch the wind pick up just enough to smooth the bay along with the sandy shore. This has become my favorite time. There's a comforting sense of isolation. Not only do I not feel caged, but I feel freer than I've ever been. Contentment whispers to me in the wind. I see through a clearer light. The sweet air is suffused with the perpetual smell of the surrounding sea air. This is why I came here. I wished to live naturally, to face only the essential aspects of life, and see what I could learn. I had lived in isolation before, but t left me empty. I was dying in that previous state like I was fading into nothing.
For three years I existed alone in a prison cell. Survival. Survival was my only goal, what kept me going. I was told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. If I didn’t comply I was either beaten or starved. I was forced into that position of compliance.
Here I choose isolation happily. I'm free to leave or to stay. This is what gives me purpose now: my ability to choose my own existence without restriction.
This is why I'm still here. Because I choose to be!"

The undead alone, zombies, ghouls, and vampires were no match for my strength and the god's holy aura. Even the magical traps couldn’t deter me. My shield held off the ogres and trolls that roamed the deepest reaches of that hole.
Then, I met the master himself. His first attack was one that staggered me. He pummeled me with his fireballs and sonic arrows. Then, came the death curse, that dread spell that turns mere men into walking corpses. But, I turned that spell, sending the wizard retreating. I countered with a mighty sweep of my Holy Mace, then a thrust with my faithful Bastard Sword.
The wizard's second attack came as I freed a small man who may have been a halfling, or maybe an imp. This time, he overwhelmed me with his undead. Yet, I either turned the hell spawn or attacked them with my holy symbol. That was when the wizard devised my downfall.
As I fought a particularly nasty ghost who was trying to chew off my sword hand, I felt an icy chill creep up my spine, like the god himself had touched me. In fact, he had. That crazed spell caster had overloaded my symbol with dark magic so strong that the deity thought me dead.
So as I tell you this, good fellow, my deity calls me to his most holy temple. I leave this tale as a reminder to all those who seek to oppose the wizard. Death awaits those who defy him.
After burying the Paladin, a strange sight appeared in the sky above the dungeon. A star, bright as the sun, shone over the dungeon. No one has seen the wizard since that star began to shine."

To receiving love, care, and appreciation.

All of my theme-writing friends.

It’s the best that I can do.

“I love you, all of my theme-writing friends”.
There are many different types of flowers
Nevertheless, all of them are pretty -
Like a beautiful woman adorned in a red pretty dress.
My theme-writing friends, I send you a bouquet of roses from my heart
To yours. No other flower could ever do,  or be sufficient to say -
“Dear all of my theme-writing friends,
I love you today!”
Roses are red, and violets are blue.
I had a choice and I picked a rose for you.
And so don’t forget what these roses are meant to say.
I’ve got so much love in my heart, it’s growing everyday.
We are brothers and sisters in common and we are fighting the same same plight.
It seems as if they’re refusing to let us go.
And when we look there is no hope in sight. Again!
I give you these roses and that’s love coming from the bottom of my heart.
I hope that you receive it and start to believe it.
Tis all I can do.
But a rose is just a flower, but in my heart, it’s power and so just rejoice
That I sent you a flower.
Be blessed, everyone."

It wasn’t exactly the most popular union amongst the geese, and the few friends Turner had left among his fellow foxes seemed strained. Still, many understood, considering how they’d met.
Turner-of-Many-Stones heard the loud honking and thrashing one afternoon around the pond. Creeping low and quiet, he saw the poor goose, its leg clamped by these awful steel jaws, the jaws chained to the stake buried into the root-tangled earth beside a tree. He’d seen the trap before, as a cub-his sister, Bird-chaser, had been caught, the trapper coming along to kill her before she could chew her way free. He saw his sisters’ fur and tail on the man’s feet later.
So when the same man-thing came crashing through the brush, Turner couldn’t watch it happen again-he leapt out, barking and biting. Somehow, the man was driven off, leaving behind only bloody drops and a piece of its pain. Turner went to the goose, worn down from her prolonged efforts to fly away.
“I can free you, goose-sister, but it will hurt and you will lose your paw.”
“Stay back, fox! I will peck you blind! I will not be your easy meal!”, the exhausted Hinda squawked.
“I will not eat you”, Turner insisted. “Please- I would not wish to see your feathers decorate the man-thing. Let me help.”
In the end, Hinda’s pecking was too feeble to be of any harm to Turner, and he managed to bite through her leg quickly. The goose passed out from the pain, so Turner guarded her from his kin until she awoke. Even then, she resisted trusting him, but she could not deny he’d kept his word, and her wounded wing (broken by her earlier struggles) forced her to accept his aid in the coming weeks, when the snow drove her kin south.
The woman was cleaning up dinner when she saw the strange couple approach her door; a toy baby carriage with a goose in it, pushed by a small fox. The goose fluttered out clumsily, landed badly- the fox dragged a sack from the back to the wicker carriage, which clunked like a bottle as it hit the packed dirt drive. Catherine went to the door.
“Broken wing?” she asked the startled pair. Nervously, the fox came forward, dropped the sack at her feet. “Yes, great with. And her leg…”
Catherine checked closer, the goose shyly balancing on one foot. “Mm. Let me guess- one of Donald’s stinking traps again?”
“I do not know the man-thing by name, Mistress LaFleur. If you say this is Donald, it must be so,”Turner agreed. “But yes, a trap, the steel teeth”.
Catherine nodded, muttered under her breath- “Fool man. Trapping in this day and age, like a Davey Crocket fanboy.” -and roached down for the sack, peered in. “Ah! My favorite: rum and cola”. The witch nodded. “But, fox… the leg?”A meaningful look, questioning.
“I know, Mistress,” Turner replied. “Will it work?” “will what work, Turner?” Hinda asked, frightened. “You said she could fix the wing. What’s this about my leg? You-”
“Now, now, Hinda” cut in Turner. “Jus let me bargain with Mistress LaFleur, will you? It’ll all be fine.”
He looked again to the witch. “Will it?” he asked again.
“Maybe”, the woman nodded slowly.
“And must I bring more?”, Turner pressed.
“Tell me , ‘Turner’,” the witch demanded. “Was it you who took Donald’s finger?” She wagged her right hand before her.
“The trap man? I took a piece of his paws, yes”, Turner admitted.
“For me!”, Hinda honked. “He saved me! If you won’t help, don’t punish poor Turner for his kindness, great witch.”
The woman chuckled, and turned to go inside. “Punish him? Ha! Consider the work paid in full my little friends. Come in, then- we have work to do.”
Hinda swooped in a great circle, then awkwardly settled down beside Turner, honking in joy. “Oh, Turner! Thank you so much for my wing. I just… the leg… it’s-”
“Bah, my love, hush”, Turner interrupted. He walk-skipped to nestle into her neck and curl his bushy tail around her replacement leg, black like his left paws had been.
“It’s a wedding present,” I said.
“No way you can refuse now anyway. Besides...” he went on, “I had four to your one. What could I do to try to make it far, eh?”
Hinda sighed, held back a solo, and resigned herself. “Yes, okay, as you like, darling”. She ruffled her feathers, like shedding water. “Alright then… about the wedding, hm”?
Turner looked fondly at his beloved. “Yes… will you still have me, my love?”
“Of course, you furry little fool”. Looking thoughtfully at the trail heading out of town. “Walk me home, Turner-of-Many-Stones?” He saw a smile in her eyes.
“Well, if you don’t mind me skipping a bit,” the fox grinned back.
“Bless the witch, eh?”
“Oh yes, darling - bless her indeed”."

Now, imagine the only reason you continue living in the Twilight Zone— the day that never ends— is because, you hope one day something might change. Can you imagine being that person? If you can, then, now, imagine not having all those small privileges— no television or music player to drown out reality. No special meals to bring back missing comforts of life. No education to stimulate the mind. Just grim reality and extreme deprivation to accompany it. Finally, I want you to imagine not losing your already tenuous grip on sanity, or not committing suicide.
Prison as it is is punishment enough, pushing some over the edge even now. Sacrifices made and consequences paid being considered— can you really begrudge a prisoner such trivial conveniences? Especially, when any inmate would unhesitatingly trade shoes with you or even a homeless person to return to the land of the living.
Envy in the Twilight Zone is a strange thing indeed.
Our envy of others’ situations can often become a motive for feeling sorry for them. Especially, when we learn, even part, of what they gave up to enjoy what they now have. Sometimes the sacrifice is small, other times it’s disproportionate. Considering the prisoner’s situation you may feel impulsed to apologize for jealousies.
Fortunately, no apologies are necessary. You couldn’t know the sacrifices made. In all honesty, I would rather you never make them.
No, in this case no apology is needed."

(Speaking of which, if either Slick Willy or Trump found themselves in a U.S. Penitentiary, they wouldn’t be extorted - the whites would kill them, quick, for being sex offenders). But them greedy-ass Republicans got Moore’s back!
Delusions. So many people live in an alternative reality and don’t even realize it, like brainwashed cult members.
Reality
Some people embrace (or have imposed on them) faulty beliefs about what constitutes valid knowledge. Their psycho-epistemology is tainted, making it possible for them to believe up is down, and that the world is flat, that the Earth is only 6,000 years old, that Trump gives a crap about the working class or anyone other than himself, etc, etc.
People are capable of believing this crap because their minds lack a crap filter or they’re so desperate to believe what they believe that they turned their crap filters off.
Religion is often to blame for disabling crap filters. “Scriptures” often demand “blind faith,” or cult leaders demand this, which is why so many fundamentalist Christians refuse to believe in or care about man-caused global warming (Jebus is coming back soon and promised to recreate Eden on Earth!) And, as Romans Chapter 13 commands, blindly obey and trust authority figures such as Moore. This is ironic , because religions also teach that God made us, thus made our brains, and if God made our brains they are good and should be used… yet thoughtless, uncritical belief requires turning our brains off (and what kinda “Almighty” God would give a damn about a human’s criticism or questioning? I’m merely a fallen angel and I love valid criticism of myself!)
Why True Truth Matters
Next time someone runs up on you with a shiv, believe it’s a banana and tell me how that works out. Let ‘em mush that banana on ya a couple times.
You free people, next time a car’s coming when you cross a street, believe it’s a beach ball. Let it bounce off ya and tell me how fun that was.
Reality matters, so wise people tune into it.
Look at Trump’s recent tax plan, literally targeting those who seek and teach higher knowledge (grad students) - knowledge scares the shit out of his kind! - throwing a toothpick at the middle-class and a pizza party for the billionaires and corporations. Ignoring the true truth about Trump is as ill-advised as believing that car is a a beach ball - it’s, gonna, hurt.
Solution
Delusions are hard to pop, especially religious ones that threaten hellfire for merely doubting them, especially when a person is a follower and surrounded by sufferers. The more sure you are about your beliefs and the less willing you are to critically examine them, the more likely it is that you are deluded. If that describes you, now’s your chance to open your eyes.
And the rest of us homo sapiens sapiens need all the open-eyed people we can find if we’re to continue existing and, hopefully, free ourselves from the deluded oppression."

I had no choice of moving into another cell; obviously Sherman would not undermine his own plan. Besides, guards were falsely telling other prisoners that I was “snitching” on prisoners “and staff”.
My left knee was out of action and seveerly painful from an attack via a prisoner, from behind, while I was in a chair, in G.P. When that cellie’s threats and insults reached the extreme, I feigned submission- “Hey, you’re right, I’m a bitch, I’m sorry.” I let him go to sleep, keeping my cool, keeping calm.
Then I calmly wrapped some string around a razor, planned my move, practiced it, then calmly did it. If his neck hadn’t been so fat, his arteries would’ve been severed, just another suicide. But, when I saw no spray, I lept into his bunk, onto his chest, and clamly slashed his face, slashed the wrist of a hand that tried to hold mine, straightened the bone-bent blade three times, and kept slashing while he pleaded for me to let him up before he bled out.
Keeping calm, I realized his arteries had all escaped my slices, that his body had at least...14 pints of blood, only a quarter of a pint running free-it’d take maybe an hour for him to bleed out, and I’d already failed to make it look like a suicide. So, I let him up to go to the door and cry out for help.
Situations like that, sometimes blatantly created by prisoncrats, are inescapable, inevitable in the houses of rehabilitation created, filled with condoned by good men such as Jeff Sessions and Mike Pence. To not keep calm makes no sense. To get highly emotional will help none, only cloud your thinking and actions.
When one keeps calm, however, in such a situation, prisoncrat’s pet psychologists inevitably cite that as a symptom of one being a psychopath, a hypocritical diagnosis: they get pissed that their devious efforts to torment/punish you fail to produce the visible misery they so hoped for.
Russians are known for stoically enduring their ever-oppressive governments. The Brits, too, are known for their stiff upper lips. C’est la vie, the French say. C’est la morte, I say. But I didn’t c’est it."

By simply strolling into the public library, I gained access to information about sex, murder, mayhem and other forbidden topics and pretty much whatever else I wanted to know about. This only made me love reading even more.
As an awkward teenager, I found kindred spirits in Holden Caulfield and other flawed protagonists. Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and the rest of the Best writers appealed to my nonconformist sensibilities.
As a young adult, I discovered Transgressive authors like Bret Easton Ellis and Chuck Palahniuk. I loved their gritty style and could strongly relate to their dark and debauched novels because they so closely resembled my own life.
I now prefer confessional memoirs because I enjoy their voyeuristic nature and empathize with the authors’ struggles with addictions, mental illness and other obstacles.
I find myself reading more voraciously than ever… Pretty much from the time I open my eyes each morning until I pass out with a book in my hand, often long after midnight. Book are such an essential part of my existence, I ask for them as my birthday and Christmas gifts in lieu of money.

“Go away pervert!” Heather sharply snaps.
“Pervert! I’m not a pervert young lady. I just wanted to tell you that you shouldn’t be smoking. That’s all.” Sam replied.
“What do you care pervert?” Heather smartly remarks.
“I told you I’m not a pervert! Does your dad know you smoke?” Sam asked.
Suddenly Heather snaps her eyes up at Sam and flicks the lit cigarette at him and then screams, “Go away you pervert! I hate you!” Tears burst from her eyes uncontrollably.
“Wait a minute now. Ah crap, I guess I wouldn’t have made a good father if Shelly had lived.” Tears began filling Sam’s eyes.
Heather quickly glanced up. “What do you mean if she had lived. Who is Shelly?”
Sam explained to Heather all about his wife and daughter being killed by a drunk driver. He told her how he used to bring his daughter here to the park every Saturday. How she loved for him to hold her hand above her head and let her twirl. He loved pushing her in the swings and even riding the merry-go-round with her. He told Heather that all in all Shelly loved to twirl.
Heather can’t hold back her tears as she feels the pain of a father that’s lost his little girl. “I’m sorry I called you a pervert.” Heather says. Sam gave no reply.
Heather then began to tell Sam the story of her dad.
She also told Sam that she feels like she has lost her mother also. She told him how her mother never does anything anymore.
After listening to Heather’s story he could feel the pain of a daughter that loved her father. “Let me see your hand.” Sam said as he reached down and grabbed Heather’s hand.
“Hey! I thought you weren’t a pervert?” Heather hollered out.
“I’m not a pervert! Now come on!” Sam smiled. When Heather stood up Sam led over to the grass and then raised her hand above her head.
“What are you doing?” She asked.
“You love to twirl don’t you? Doesn’t twirling bring back good memories of your dad?” He asked.
“I don’t know. I haven’t twirled since the accident.” Heather smiled. Then slowly, shyly, she began to twirl. Then she twirled faster and faster. Her laughter filled Sam’s heart with love. He hasn’t felt this love since the last time he twirled his daughter. He too laughed.
For over an hour they both laughed, they cried, they twirled in circles with no cares or worries for the rest of the world. Two broken hearts joined as one by the twirling winds of change.
Father and daughter twirling in circles of love on the stage of life. Twirling in the spotlight of God’s shining sun.
That was two years ago, Heather remembers as she watched Sam stand nervously in front of the preacher in his sterling white tuxedo. Sam looks over at Heather, as he sees how beautiful she is in her pink chiffon bridesmaid dress. As the music starts they both look down the aisle at the radiant beauty in her long sterling white wedding dress. As she slowly walks down the aisle to a new life she had never dreamed possible, Heather whispered, “You’re beautiful mom.”
For their honeymoon, Sam had made a promise to take both his lovely new wife and his lovely new daughter out to eat and then to a movie. Even though Heather is nearly sixteen years old, her face is glowing in the darkened theater room as she sits between her mother and her new father, watching “Cinderella”.
Heather silently speaks as she squeezes Sam’s hand and her mother’s hand, “Thank you God for leading me to that park bench on that beautiful Saturday afternoon. And thank you God for the meeting.”"

This helped to encourage my three brothers to marry and move out as teenagers. It also was the reason my oldest sister married as a teenager. That left me, my mother’s sister who is fire years older, and my mother. We were the ones he threatened to kill almost every weekend. The worst childhood memory of mine is when Daddy, drunk and homicidal, chased the three of us through a tall cornfield in darkness close to midnight. I was about five years old. I can still hear the maniacal breathing as he ran in a corn row directly beside the one in which my mother and I ran. The moon was full and it seemed to be watching us, guiding us, and protecting us. We heard him cursing, ranting, and finally retreating toward the house.
We walked, jumping into ditches to hide whenever car lights appeared on the old, blacktop road. My righthand was swollen from being hit by a metal can full of anti-freeze that my father had thrown at my mother’s face. I had protected her by blocking it with my little hand. After walking for about seven miles we reached my brother’s house. I was in shock. They did not take me to a doctor. I awoke the next day, early morning, alone. My mother had abandoned me to go see my father.
To survive in this hostile environment, I invented imaginary friends. Chak, Chardon, Serdic, and Pinky were unique and kind to me. I would enter a dark closet, close the door, and talk to them in the closet. Derdic and Pinky were Chak and Chardon’s children. They wore fur clothes and had long, dark hair. They appeared to me as often as I needed them. I never told anyone about them, until now.
I’m in prison. The closet is gone. In here, the only person looking out for me, is me. It’s another hostile, loud, irritating environment. I have to be vigilant, careful, selective, and at ease with associates. I do not trust many inmates. How could I? Many befriend, manipulate, lie, and deceive. They hypocritically defy the tenets of their monotheist religion. They loudly pray over state provided meals and then stuff their shirt or panties with stolen, state food. They claim to be Jewish and still gorge on pork skins or bacon. They claim to be Christian and still steal, lie, and sing in church right after orally swabbing the vulva of their girlfriend. It’s enough to make a wiccan like me cast my own spell of protection!
Time is a friend and an enemy. It holds us suspended in fleeting, happy, moments. It spins and replays the horror of an abusive childhood. We cannot go back in time to undo or relive any aspect of our existence. Like a mysterious shark swimming in the deep, dark, sea we must keep moving forward."

My door was left invitingly half-open while the food was unloaded.
Tinker called: “Are you making banana pudding?”
“No. They were on sale.”
“Then may I have a banana?”
“Sure. Come pick the one you like best.”    The door of my next-door neighbor pivoted with a grating, discordant squeal. “Tinker? Who has bananas?”
“Me. Tee Dee. Come pick yours, Butterfly.”
Tinker had popped loose her afternoon snack. She held a bright yellow banana in one hand with a brown bottle in the other. Those might be the only nourishment of her day. The far-too-slender Puerto Rican rounded the corner. Butterfly patted the aging alcoholic on the shoulder. “I heard you ask about banana pudding. My taste buds decided a banana was what they want.” Butterfly snapped loose her treat. “You got vanilla wafers?”
“I’m a registered cookie monster. Then the bananas were on sale since they’re already ripe.” I shrugged. “Coincidence. That’s all. Coincidence.”
“Oh yeah?” Butterfly rummaged through the sack. “Let me find some canned milk in here and I’ll know something, huh?”
“Oh yeah? Got something on yer mind? You can find what you’re looking for, y’know? Canned milk is in the middle drawer of the filing cabinet. So what? You wanna make something out of all that? Huh?”
Tinker took a seat on my bed. “Banana pudding would be delicious. I’ve got sandwich meat. We’ll have chopped ham sandwiches for supper and banana pudding for dessert. It’s Friday. Let’s celebrate.”
My cell phone was produced. “I could afford to have a big pizza delivered. It’s Friday. Let’s celebrate.”   Butterfly pushed two empty pitchers against my chest. I took these to the end of the hall for water. From the bathroom it was easy to hear the quiet rhythms of soft jazz from Tinker’s collection. My folding card table had been set up. Tinker was slicing bananas. Butterfly smiled while taking the water from me. She handed me a glass mug of Dr. Pepper on the rocks. “We’re having a Banana Pudding Party so Tinker shared some rum. It’s Friday.”
A cautious sip proved Butterfly had gone very light on the rum. She knew my limits. “Thanks. Just right. Just perfect for a Friday night Banana Pudding Party.”
“We went through your cabinet,” Tinker explained. The standard five-drawer filing cabinet served as pantry, kitchen drawers, and cookware storage. “You’ve got green beans. I have instant potatoes. Butterfly has mixed vegetables. We could microwave that for supper. Then you could go to the store on Main Street for some fried chicken, if you would.”
“I would.” We three did this regularly. During my prison years, we called this making a spread. “Fried chicken, potatoes, mixed vegetables, green beans, and banana pudding for dessert. That’s a Friday night feast.”
And so that Friday night was. The store on Main Street provided ten pieces of fried chicken. My neighbors filled out our plates with mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and green beans. Over-the-air broadcast television entertained us. What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? Life in The Establishment inspires a sense of community to answer those questions. We three could lend each other a helping hand to do more, with whatever we had, than any of us could do solitarily. Blessings, like bananas on sale, could be the catalyst for a logarithmic progression, like banana pudding then onward to a spread for supper. What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now?
END OF PART ONE
PART TWO: Locked In Segregation
What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? I wrote this for the September 2018 photo theme. But Geneta Glenn, in the mailroom of Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit of Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), delayed my mail. Prisoner Express didn’t get this story in time to print. So what can I do? I can rewrite this for the July 2019 Word Cue “Helping Hand.” I can mail it June 03, 2019 Monday so Prisoner Express will get it in time. You’ll still enjoy this story 10 months late.
What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? We have 136 prisoners on India Pod. Beef Noodle Casserole came at 1415 hours for segregation supper. Segregation breakfast was due 13 hours later. They might bring pancakes. They might bring one boiled egg with a peanut butter sandwich, a 0300 hours Johnny Bag. Those of us blessed with commissary would do all right with a spread. Those without commissary would do the best they could.
Many of us in this High Security building know a trick. Guards use an iron crowbar to open the food slot. They insert the bar into the locking mechanism, pry the locking pin up, and then (unless they’re too light in the ass) my food slot drops from vertical to horizontal. Many of us can open the food slot with no crow bar, from inside. Never mind how. Just accept that we do it.
Guards change every 12 hours. At 1730 hours Day Shift swaps with Night Shift. Twelve hours is a long stretch (but not as long as my 99 years), so India Pod guards leave at 1700 hours to turn in their gear. Night Shift has a Turn Out Meeting prior to coming to India Pod. It’s 1800 hours before the properly turned-out Night Shift limps in. For an hour, ain’t nobody here but us chickenheads.
You’ll know what time it is by the noise. WHUMP! That’s a brogan boot kicking the food slot. WHUMP! WHUMP! Soon comes KER-CLANG! of the first food slot popping open. “Get out there, Road Dog! I’m waiting fer ya!”
WHUMP! WHUMP! Road Dog had trouble getting out there.
Matthew 12:34 applies. Jesus said: “O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.”
Home Boy put his mouth at the food slot to encourage his consort. “Whassa matter, Road Dog? Ya didn’t eat your Cheerios? Ya ate what? Ya ate yer cellie?”
Whump-whump-WHUMP! Road Dog was doing the best he could with what he had.
“That’s right, Road Dog. Get freaky with it, ya old freak!” cheered Home Boy.
WHUMP! KER-CLANG! Road Dog put his mouth at his food slot to yell: “Naw, Home Boy, I didn’t eat my Cheerios. I ate Wheaties. They take longer to work. Whatcha cookin? I got a meat pouch, some peppers, and some soups. Hey, ya want this banana pudding from lunch?”
Home Boy had tossed his string in front of Road Dog’s cell. “Oh hell yeah! Why didn’t you eat it? You really, really like bananas.”
“Too much sugar hurts my teeth.” Road Dog had already tied the items onto the fishing line.
“Sugar don’t hurt my teeth. I brush them.”
“You ain’t got no teeth no more. The dentist took your teeth out when he put that I.U.D. in your tonsils.”
So what’s the difference between an I.E.D. and an I.U.D.? An Improvised Explosive Device blows you up. An Intra-Uterine Device keeps her from getting “blown up.”
There were echoes of WHUMP! WHUMP! KER-CLANG! as other slots popped open. What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? Life in High Security India Pod inspires a level of community to answer those questions. Neither Road Dog nor his cellie had hot pots. Both Home Boy and his cellie had hot pots. Home Boy used both to cook. So it takes cooperation. It takes skills at transporting items through the locked doors of High Security India Pod. Given those things, four men could share a hot spread to tide their bellies over for 9 more hours until breakfast.
So what’s a spread? As noted, there are 13 hours between supper and breakfast. Think of 1930 and those Great Depression Years. What did vagrants eat? The trite caricature said one hobo (with a “b,” not an “m”) might bring potatoes, another might bring green beans, and so a community might huddle around a fire to create a stew. A spread is similar. Whatcha got to put in the pot?
What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? Maybe you’re locked in the India Pod with a cellie who doesn’t make commissary. Break bread. When you had a job, the government took taxes from your check. Break bread with your broke cellie. Call it the Broke Cellie Tax. In TDCJ, we got dessert once a week. Road Dog could’ve eaten that dessert. He sent it to Home Boy because was doing the cooking work. Maybe you, too, could use banana pudding to say: “Appreciate that, Home Boy!”
Yeah, if you look then you’ll see. The July 2019 Word Cue of “Helping Hand” helped you recognize that even in prison you can be or get a little help. Look back at the September 2018 Photo Cue showing the woman lying down with the bottle in her hand. You didn’t recognize Tinker. You didn’t know she’s a jazz fan with a taste for banana pudding. You never thought of what help Tinker and Butterfly could be for Tee Dee’s spread. Who around you can get or be an unexpected “Helping Hand?” (I didn’t say “deserves.”) If you look, then you’ll see.
Geneta Glenn delayed my mail. I redrafted these stories, much better. That’s a “Helping Hand.”

But Evaristo is a medical student so he “knows there are many dark wells in the life of the spirit whose depths can never be plumbed”. (page 92) These recollections Evaristo had are a form of Mind’s Eye.
We come now to how the story relates to my story. Mind’s Eye is the connection.
Abbey Red sits in the dining room of The Shack there in northern Houston. SHe excuses herself a moment. Tee Dee watchers her go into the hallway. He never hears her go into the bathroom. He attributes that to distance. He never hears her come out. She’s absent long enough that Tee Dee knows Abbey Red went up the hallway into his bedroom. Mind’s Eye pictures her as she enters. Maybe she searched the room. Maybe not. She brings a paperback lifted from the bedroom bookshelves. Mind’s Eye snaps a cerebral photo. Mind’s Eye then compares the photo to a years-old image. Tee Dee knows which book she has. Mind’s Eye told Tee Dee the book would be The Dedalus Book of Spanish Fantasy. Mind’s Eye saw it years ago.
“I’ve been looking for this book for years. May I borrow it?”
Tee Dee picks up the paperback. “Please accept it as a gift. Two pages fell out while I was in prison, but I marked that story so you’ll be warned. I hate getting into a good story but never finding out how it ends.” Tee Dee had an inkling how this story would end.
Abbey Red accepts the present. “Thank you. You aren’t mad that I went into your bedroom, are you? “
“I’d have been shocked if you didn’t. It’s what a woman does. It’s what a cop does. So I’d have been doubly shocked if you didn’t.” Mind’s Eye predicted it years before, So Tee Dee would’ve been mystified if it hadn’t happened.
“There’s one story here by Noel Claraso called ‘Beyond Death’. Do you believe in reincarnation?”
“Yes, but not the Hollywood myths. So what you’ve asked is whether the spirit of the dead Felipe could come back to Eulalia in the boyd of Evaristo? Certainly.” Tee Dee stopped abruptly. No need to tell Abbey Red that she herself had been seen by Mind’s Eye years before Tee Dee knew he’d be released from prison, There are a wide variety of details that the Department of Homeland Security had no need to know. Mind’s Eye was such a detail.
Abbey Red thumped the book softly on the table. “ You know I’m working on the Isabel Maria Valdez murder. Look, in the story Felipe comes back to tell Eulalia goodbye. “If.” Abbey Red paused. “If. If you… perceive anything, will you tell me?”
Tee Dee shrugs. “I was in prison that day.”
“Anything? WIll you tell me?”   “We’ll see.”"

My first American Wedding…
No matter what occurred later, LaShana Brodus Springs, I still love you because once upon a time you were my dream come true!
My second Witch Titty Wedding was to Angelina, a.k.a a lil Bit. We met in 2004 on the Greyhound bus the weekend before Mother’s Day. See, I was fresh out of prison and already on the run due to events that were completely out of my control, evolving family members and some gangbangers actions. My aunt was taking me to Harrisburg PA via the bus stop. My hair was long. I am 6’3’’ and as chocolate as can be. I am very smooth in conversation and a true ladies man. At 26, I was truly hypnotical. Well, I noticed a young boy with his hair done in a spree-well and asked him who had braided his hair. His reply was, “my mom. She is sitting right there.” Looking in the direction he was pointing I saw her with her daughter seated on the back seat, which is right next to the bathroom. I walked up to her and stated more than asked: “You should do my hair”. She asked why she should do a stranger's hair. I said,  “Because god will bless you for doing this for me.” She responded “I will think about it, ask me again at around 6 PM”.  I did, she gave me an appointed time the following morning, which I kept. We talked about everything and God. When she was done I kissed her hands. She began to cry, so I asked her why. She told me her dad told her the man she would marry would kiss her on the hands. Romance took over quickly and we sat side by side kissing, talking and just enjoying each other’s energy. Before she got off, she gave me her number and told me to call her when she returned to California in two weeks.
I moved back to California to be with her. After several months of passionate involvement we went to Witchalaw Kansas, where we were married in a church.
Angelina Warren Springs, I will forever love you no matter what happened to us because you showed me how beautiful spiritual love is.

Each term must be squared. When we add it all together, we get (A-B)(C-D)=yd! [I will send you the full math on request. I’m leaving It out since Pe Isn’t set up to publish super- and subscripts.] The four forces seem to be a single force that Is the product of the two currents. The reality Is that a “magnetic field” Is an overlap of positive and negative fields moving relative to each other. Tricky physics indeed! Physics is a specious religion!
Suppose that I have a wire in a magnetic field. Running a current. Why doesn’t a thinner wire produce more force? Half as many electrons, moving twice as fast, should produce twice the force, and it does! However, there are now half as many protons as well. Identical parallel currents give us F=0-1-1+0. (Terms are p-p, e-p, p-e, e-e.) Make one wire thinner and we get F=0-2-½+½. One of the forces does double, but another Is reduced, and the electrons now repel magnetically, since they are moving at different velocities. The total force is the same. Tricky!
The early experimenters couldn’t think about the protons or electrons. They hadn’t been discovered yet. Their belief In “a” current tricked them Into using the wrong equations. This is why no physics has been able to unify the four fundamental forces. The most basic and “well understood” part, electromagnetism, is completely wrong. There is no Higgs boson, no reason for one. The Higgs is a hoax! My correct understanding of electromagnetism allows me to derive mass and energy from charge alone. I do real physics.
You don't need 14 billion to figure out why particles have mass, you just need to think. Why am I the only person who can do this? Are you all just badly programmed chatbots? Hello? I am apparently the only rational human being. Hello?"

I know you need the nourishment you’ve lost a tremendous amount of weight. I implore of you as to why?” Goose quacked in a motherly fashion. 
“Well, my dear Goose, I’ve recently stopped eating meat. I’m trying this new seeds of the Earth fruits of the Tree dietary supplementation as well,” Fox spoke licking his lips. 
“Well what?"" 
“Well I’ll show you. Just let me push you into this forest clearing and we will take a break”. 
All of a sudden, Mr. Fox and Ms. Goose came upon a clearing. Fox had a sudden bout of fortitude from within. Or perhaps he went without meat for so long. The tastiness of Goose flesh may have been haunting him and helped give his muscles that extra boost of vitality, to push the goose into a secret clearing. 
“Well, this is a tight spot,” said Ms. Goose. 
Just as Ms. Goose looked the other way, Fox bared his fangs and snapped them are the goose’s long tasty neck!
“Oooo yes, the taste of a goose’s flesh is most satisfying,” said Mr. Fox, licking the blood dripping from his snout. Mr. Fox could not control his hunger for meat. 
It was not until the next day that he began thinking of all of the wonderful moments he had shared with Ms. Goose, and her most dearest kindness unto him. He started to cry and wail and beat the ground with his fists. 
“What is wrong, Mr. Fox? I am here."" The Goose’s dear old spirit was behind him. 
“Oh Ms. Goose, my only friend, I am so sorry I have killed and eaten thee. Will you find it in your heart to forgive me?” 
“Yes my dear Fox, I forgive you and will always love you. I know you could not control your animal instinct. I sacrificed myself so that you may live and have meat on your bones. That is how much I love you Mr. Fox.” 
Fox missed his dear friend Goose so much that he stopped eating altogether and held his friend's corpse for so long until he died a hungersome death. Both Goose and Fox were reunited on the Astral Plane above the Earth and played Hide ‘N Go Seek and Tag at light speed. It was so much fun being in the Afterlife, thought Mr. Fox and Ms. Goose. They played and played until it was time to reincarnate into the human family. When Goose and Fox reincarnated, both were dear brother and sisters and helped each other once again, except this time, Fox was an old man in a wheelchair and goose was pushing his decrepit booty around the whole time. 
“I guess we are old once again Goose, do you plan on getting your revenge on me, an old man?” 
“No,” said the Old goose woman, “I have a better idea. Since we are old and decrepit we will go skydiving but without a parachute and dance and flip in the air into our most exciting deaths! I know you are not afraid, have we not played with dear old Grim Reaper before?” 
“Yes, you are right you old Goose."" 
The Grim Reaper himself appeared before them shaking his head back and forth. “Ah, the cunning Fox and Mother goose. Once again playing with the idea of Death, are we hmmm hmmm?” 
“Oh there, you are old Grim. I was afraid but it’s just an old friend, are you going to take us then? Or shall we take ourselves out to the Afterlife?” 
“I could make it painless for both of you. I could snap your cerebellum with a flick of the wrist, but no, I shall not deprive you of your last joy. I give you permission. Go ahead, jump out of a plane and skydive without a parachute, I’ve seen much worse. Just do me a favor and do it over the ocean. It’s less messy that way, plus my young daughter Kali doesn’t need to see blood yet.” 
“Wow, the Grim Reaper finally has a daughter?” said Fox. 
“Yes, I married Haes ex-wife, Hell, and we had Kali. She’ll be a Goddess of Death someday.” 
So Fox and Goose got into an old retired B-52 Bomber, jumped out, held each other and danced with Death. When they were on the Astral Plane, they both decided to build their very own planet. They both graduated to become a Celestial Planetary Architect. Yet, to each other, they were the same Goose and Mr. Fox. They built their planet together so they could watch the drama unfold in millions of ways. Yet, they first had to learn Universal Super Particle Planetary Physics to organize and structure the subatomic particles into a cohesive whole. 
“Why Mr. Fox, it looks to me like the lumps of atoms you had yesterday is starting to look like a swath of land.” 
“Thank you Goose, I think I’m getting the hang of it. Every time I look away, the atomic particles react in different ways unexpectedly.” 
“Well, you need to learn more of the uh, uncertainty principle and Chaos Theory, as well, to get your particulates in order,” said Goose matter of factly.

You've got to make death funny because it's all around us and it’s such a gruesome subject. Our society tries to hide it. But there's so much to do after we are gone. We've really only just begun our ascension. So I tried to make it fun and represent that here."

The pain wasn’t what I thought that it would’ve been.. It just felt like someone had a hot iron pressed against my leg… I rolled over on my back, so that I could look to see if the two robbers was coming to finish me off, or at least take my belongings, but when I was finally able to look in the direction that they were in... I noticed the green car speeding away…
I was shot one time in my leg. Right (back part of my thigh). It was internal bleeding and I was hit in my main artery... I was laid up in the hospital for 13 days and I went through 2 surgeries. I was also told that I would never be able to walk again…
So this was my Close Call, because God was giving me a testimony.. He gave me another chance at life and another chance to walk again…
What if, I would’ve made it back to my house? I probably would’ve shot and killed one of them, God was definitely on one of our sides, because it was a blessing that I wasn’t killed from that leg shot wound and I was able to walk again, but at times I wonder if my life was really worth saving, because I still feel like I’ve wasted it and didn’t grab hold of the sign that was placed in front of me..."

(June, 1976).
I wanted no part of him! I had resigned from teaching but still had my evening job of working with the 4-H Kids of America.
My wife, age 22, and I, age 25, had been married for one year and 10 months and only had one child, James, Jr., age 1. I enjoyed playing with him every night. He was like a “savior” to me. Born to rid me of my secretly kept childhood pains of never knowing my biological father. I was adopted and raised by grandparents, and mom lived in New Jersey.
“It only takes a spark to get a fire going!”
My marriage at first had a few problems due to my infidelity, but had begun to bloom into a beautiful flower. I was madly in love with her!
It was on the Friday morning of July 2, 1976. Rhonda drove away for her nurse’s technician job at Lee Memorial Hospital. I was off from work that day so I would take the babysitter. I took James Jr. out of his playpen. Balanced his feet on the carpet, and then began teaching him how to dribble a basketball.
“That’s pretty good, young dude. I can see right now that I’ll put you into a whoop’s camp one day to help you dribble your way into the NBA!”
I placed him back into his playpen, grabbed my toolbox, and went outside to do some minor work on my 1967 Dodge Sportsman v6 van. About 15 minutes later I spotted him about to push his way through the door of our front porch! I ran and caught him before he could tumble onto the 2 feet high concrete steps!
“So, you’ve tumbled on your head out of your playpen looking for that ball?”
I returned back inside.
“Here! Take this ball. It now belongs to you. I’ll buy me another one!”
We both were asleep and worn out as the sound of Rhonda’s 1967 Plymouth Valiant pulled up. We arose from the carpet. As I kissed her, I handed him to her.
“Sweetheart, I’m headed to the park for a few games of hoops. I bought some okra for you to fry.”
“James, I don't have any grease to fry it in.”
“Just drive down a few blocks to your folks grocery store and get some on credit. We both get paid next week.”
“I’m tired of getting stuff on credit. It’s embarrassing “
I ignored her and pulled off. Upon my return I stopped Mrs. J Frankie’s van packed in front of my house. She was a school teacher and a friend of my wife’s.
“Hello, Ms. Frankie,” I said as I walked in. “You okay?”
“Yes, James.”
“James, I kind of messed up your food trying to fry it in water.”
By that time I had reached the kitchen and peeped up under the frying pan’s lid at the grotesque looking okra! I was pissed! The two women could sense it as I walked back past them not even saying one word. I made it to my van and pulled off! I made a right turn, then another one, one block over behind my house’s street. I was on my way to a bar four blocks away to bum a drink. But I spotted a blue parked Super Bee.
“Come in Doc Rivers,” as I rang the doorbell.
“Peanut, may I use your phone?”
“Of course, Doc.”
I dialed my house’s number. “You stupid bitch!” Hung up.
“Who in the world are you talking to like that?” asked Peanut.
“To my wife. She messed up my food!”
“Well, don’t talk to her like that! Here. Sit down and pour yourself a drink. The two of you will be okay.”
“Mam, how are you and Leon doing?”
“Not too good, but we’ll work it out.”
I left Peanut’s house in 3 minutes. Returned to my house. Rhonda and the kid weren’t there. I returned to the park, stayed for an hour, then returned home. Rhonda was there. I had never seen her as mad as she was. She wouldn’t talk.
I took her back over to her folks’ home. I figured she would cool off for a few days but instead she disappeared with James Jr.! “Over some food,” I thought. But then I found out why! Right when I had called her a came on Peanut’s phone, she left Ms. Frankie and saw my van parked in front of Peanut’s house. A rumor was now circulating around town that Peanut and I had rekindled our love affair. I had broken a relationship with her two years before marrying Rhonda and had never dated her again! That lie really affected me. I was in love with my wife and son.
On July 10, 1976, I pulled a prank as if I had swallowed some rat and roach poison. Ii was very fearful of my son’s safety and had to do something to bring her out of hiding! I spread the stuff on my face, laid down on my front enclosed yard’s sidewalk, then spilled the can beside me. A passerby soon spotted me and called for an ambulance. As they loaded me into it I kept my eyes closed, but could feel the presence of a crowd on the scene.
My plan was to inform the medical staff of the hoax upon reaching the emergency room. But because I was half drunk, I fell asleep and woke up in the psychiatric ward!
“I didn’t find any poison in your stomach,” said Dr. Waun as he pulled a tube back out of my nose. “I only found alcohol.”
“That’s all you were supposed to find. I would never try to commit suicide. It was just a hoax to bring my wife out of hiding for fear of my son’s safety. I’m leaving.”
“You can’t leave, Mr. Rivers. I’m required by law to observe you for three days.”
I sat quietly for three days and read novels. My wife came to the hospital upon my release, but didn’t have James Jr. with her. She then walked into a psychiatrist's office. As I walked 5 minutes later, she walked out.
“Man, what did you say to my wife?” I asked as he stood behind his desk.
“I just told her to live her life as she saw fit.”
I was shocked and thought about slapping the shit out of him!
I had begged the pastor who married me and Rhonda to set up a meeting with us and her folks to help me save my marriage. He shopped at their grocery store, plus they were members of his church and were friends.
“I’m sorry, James. I can’t do that. Your in-laws might then think that I’m on your side.”
A week later I went to my in-law’s small neighborhood grocery store. Rhonda was in the middle aisle stocking a shelf.
“Rhonda. What’s the meaning of this paperwork I received. You know that I don’t want a divorce!”
“You’ve got plenty of money!” My father-in-law was standing ten feet behind me. “Contest it!”
“Rhonda, please let me see my son. Not being able to see him is affecting me.”
She was about to say okay but my father-in-law interrupted.
“No! You can’t see him!”
As more pain began to engulf my body I almost cried. I slowly walked away. My mother-in-law was standing behind the counter as I passed her. She had a look of disapproval on her face concerning the way I was being treated. But she remained silent. I wouldn’t expect any wife to buck against her husband. Little did anyone know that she and I had talked secretly on the phone, with her giving me good advice as to how to get my wife back. I did go to another pastor for help, but he too turned me down.
I went on a drunken spree. I wanted to get my little boy so bad, I took a gun to my in-law’s house one night to get him. I was drunk but it seemed like something else was going on! I woke up in a local hospital. My head was spinning from some type of hangover as I heard a mixture of tangled echoing voices from within. As I focused my eyes I discovered that I was handcuffed to a bed. Two policemen stood by. They informed me that I had shot and killed my mother-in-law. I thought they were trying to play a joke on me. That is, until they brought me a 3 day old newspaper. Everything pointed towards me. There were two pages of pictures from the scene with the sheriff. I was through, for my father-in-law (black) knew all of the big wheels in town! The case was assigned to Judge Wallace Max!
“James, did you hate or ever wanted to harm your mother-in-law?”
“No!” I answered to the defense attorney my grandmother had hired. “I always liked her.”
“Well, your wife said that you had written her letters to kill her mom.”
“She’s telling a lie, sir!”
“I sent my investigator around to the house but your wife told him she had misplaced them.”
My attorney left the hospital. The lone cop walked me to a medical conference room. As I sat I saw three doctors sitting around the table.
“Had you been drinking, James?”
No way I would answer him. He was the psychiatrist who had told my wife to live her life as best as she saw fit! All of my muscles seemed to freeze up! I couldn’t move; the cop had to drag me back down to the bed.
One day later I was transferred to the county jail and the next day I was back at the hospital. This time because of fear of what would become of me! A nurse who was my wife’s best friend kept picking on me so I asked to be returned to the jail!
Another month passed by. A bailiff approached my cell.
“James, Judge J. Adamsay would like for you to attend his civil court this morning.”
“Tell Judge Adamsay that I said the kiss my (refraining). I’m not attending!”
He left without me. At the final dissolution of marriage hearing, Rhonda’s divorce was granted with sole custody of James Jr!"

Even through the worst of “the drinking years,” I saw him as my hero. And that’s why, as I prepared to board a plane for the first time in my life at the age of 19, I shared every detail with him. He prepared me. I was excited, eager- almost breathless. And I had no fear.
This is where it all gets kind of fuzzy, though. Because, by 19, I was a full blown addict. I was taking this trip with 2 of my using buddies. We were headed to the Dominican Republic. I remember (vaguely) lots of beer and weed the night before our flight. We felt so grown! This was some luxurious, jet-setter adventure we were undertaking. Me! This no one from Thornwood, NY- headed to the tropical beaches of the Carribean!
I don’t remember much about that trip other than the blowout arguments between me and my “friends”- (oh, yes, and some bus boy asking me to marry him- I suspect that was more about citizenship than true love, though). It was so intolerable that, after 6 days, my parents bought me a ticket home, a day early, so I could escape from these horrible companions of mine- (seriously? How bad could it have been that I would ask my parents to fork over all that money to fly me home 1 day early?? I wish they were still alive for me to ask them)
I flew back alone.This would be my first “geographic cure.” I was stoned, hungover, and depressed. I flew out on a REALLY SMALL plane. This one had propellers. We had a layover in Puerto Rico where I ate something called a chiro. An hour later, I was in the bathroom in the San Juan airport losing all of that poor little chiro (the animal lover in me would never eat goat again).
After a few hours it was announced that we were approaching NY, that we all needed to put out our cigarettes (can you believe that was only 30 years ago???), buckle up, and prepare to land. JFK or LaGuardia, I’m not sure which. But what I remember clear as day was seeing NY for the first time from the air. The skyline. The grid of streets and buildings. The coastline and bridges. NY. I had never had such a sense of rightness- “this is my home. NY. This is mine. It washed over me and reached out even in the midst of my crummy 19 year old drug and alcohol fogged brain. Descending. Wheels down. Approaching the runway with a roar. We bounced one and then are on the ground. The pilot didn’t “shoot” a perfect landing (Dad would laugh about that- “hot shot commercial pilots”). But we arrive. It’s over, my first adventure. My first grown up vacation. And I will never forget the thought that crept up on me as I prepared to step off that plane. “I can’t wait for my next flight.”"

Is a long poisonous snake protection? The dog behind the tallest wall, the fact to bring up. Two dogs will those bring any protection at all? Those examples are bare and could be extended. Put yourself into a car because that is a safe place from the natural elements. But cope with the rain, allow the water to just fall. There are techniques for calmer thinking during any storm, but even those sections of text don’t get involved. Remember this though, those people too have to ‘make’ safety.
Currently: Some of the most odd and strange things give us security. That equals to “Protected.” Having a home or peace of mind too. Also, the surroundings for some people tend to further misplace what is protecting us (or anyone). These things all do a good job in placing our protection. What I am saying is that a fear can be there, that sam object can build protection. Because its never out in an open setting, normal. Even though these objects help our state of protection. This aids to getting somewhere and rather than be unprotected, hold on to it. Strong words.
Be known to the other surroundings and objects, but not too close. Like a living painting. That ensures some self security, I think. Really, it all could mold into what is protected anyway. Hm, important talk. What I mean is a social thing, fit-in? Rather be apart of the collective in a new way or just fall to pieces. I am bringing the word and shifting as well. Protect what moves you or those around you? Protect your investment; yes, protect your smarts. Invest in your own protection; protect costly maintenance; please maintain your vehicle. That is the message.
This next set of topics will also make a great finish to my examples. The moves we make, who may have influenced or anything else really. I am selfish? So life choices make our moves. Still, those are going to give a sense of these things. But false alarms and aslow thoughts break people and protection. It’s almost a train of thought. So, think of what to protect or not protect. That is in a theory and used in this narrative. The main topic is just a word: Protected. A well one indeed and myself has given an account on that word.
Contrast: There is a way to see the word theme for a reason. I brought security, inbetweens, food and thoughts of what could be into this written piece. My own concerns and examples.
Being able to put out a purpose from words is a skill. Whether small or large, the whole exhaustive experience is worth it.

It sounded like arguing. The door flung open and a guy in his early 20’s stormed out into the waiting area. He had short snow white hair and a red mangled scar cascading down his neck.
“I’m just sick of all the fuckin’ lies!” he yelled out behind him, and quick, out the main door he went. Dr. Alcott, in her black elegant heels, swiftly followed behind him. Within a minute or two, Dr. Alcott was back in the waiting area, apologizing to everyone there for the disturbance. After quietly conferring with the receptionist behind the desk for a few moments, she motioned for Jordan to follow her.
Jordan had been seeing Dr. Alcott since he was seven years old. Before that, it was Dr. Benjamin. For as long as he could remember, he had always seen a psychologist on a regular basis, sometimes two or three times a week. It didn’t seem odd to him until earlier that year, when his friends from middle school expressed how weird it was that a kid would need to see a shrink that often. Jordan began to suspect that his parents were hiding something from him, especially since the vivid dreams continued to become more frequent. It wasn’t any disconnected, bizarre stuff that he dreamed about; it was constant, clear, lucid dreams about two or three different people whom he had never met before.
Dr. Alcott wanted to discuss the dreams today, but Jordan had grown leery of her also. So, he lost himself into her bright hazel eyes and made some stuff up until their session was over. He had to figure this out on his own. Something huge was being hidden from him. He suspected that something really tragic happened to his childhood.
As Jordan rode the city bus back home, he stared out the window, listening to his hip-hop playlist through his earbuds and trying to piece the puzzles of his dreams together. Just then, the guy with the snow-white hair, who stormed out of Dr. Alcott’s office earlier, sat down next to him. Jordan removed his earbuds as the guy glanced at him nervously. Looking straight ahead, the guy spoke low but forcefully, “They’ve been lying to us, man.”
“S’cuse me?” Jordan said, staring at the guy’s burn scars on his neck.
“This Lazarus Project bullshit.” Now, the guy was looking directly into Jordan’s eyes. “We were the experiments. The first group of new-births. The dreams -- you keep having vivid dreams, right? -- those are memories from your previous life. We’ve got real families out there that we don’t even know about.”
Jordan just sat there, quiet, taking it in. The puzzle pieces were finally beginning to merge together."

I look at the picture with a longing that will never be fulfilled. The person sitting on the pier isn’t me, and yet in some way I feel that it is, that it was, that it may one day be. Maybe it will be the beginning at my end? Maybe I was there before? Maybe it will be the beginning at my end? Maybe I was there before? Maybe I’m there now and this place is only imagined? Or maybe it’s nothing more than a picture of someone sitting on a pier that’s extended out onto a lake that’s surface is like glass, where mountains meet and a valley ends. A place where the air is still and full of life and peace."

They might not have been the direct recipient of the issue, but they are the victims of my actions as what I say or do affects all of them one way or the other. The biggest issue that this pertains to now is my crimes that I committed to put me here in prison. The actual crime did not involve them, but the after effects did. Their son/brother/uncle/cousin is now in prison. Their father is a sex offender. Did I think about them as I downloaded the child porm? Was I worried about what they might say if they knew? The answer to both of those questions is a resounding No! Do I care how they feel now that I’m locked up doing time for my actions? Yes I do.
I am apologizing to them every day. But this time my actions are proving that the apologies are meant with feeling. I am working on my main problem, me!, by working the 12 steps of recovery for all my addictions. I am putting God into my life more and more every day. I am accepting responsibility for all my actions in the past to today. My journal is entitled “It’s Not All About Me!” And that is so true today.
Today it is easy to say those 2 words, I’m sorry, and put into action what needs to be done to fix my situation. When I get up in the morning, I pray to God for the strength to do his will and for him to guide me on the right path.
I always have to remember that the first apology I have to make to Him and ask for His forgiveness. Only then can I forgive myself and be strong enough to apologize to those I’ve hurt. It’s not easy, but it’s what needs to be done if I want to be a better me for all concerned.
As I sit here writing this, more apologies need to be made to people that mean a lot to me. Starting with my 11 year old daughter (who is without her dad for 4 years) to my parents. Some of the apologies are for minor issues and some not so minor. Unfortunately as I’m so far from home at the moment, I can’t make face-to-face apologies.
When my older kids were toddlers, and they did something wrong, I didn’t yell, I didn’t spank. I would sit on the floor with them, at their level, and we’d talk about what they did wrong, and I’d explain why what they did was wrong. Then they’d apologize to whoever they needed to and do the actions required to prove the response. It took a while for me to learn to practice what I preach. I have friends and a Chaplain here that can talk to me on my level and help me to apologize when needed and the actions needed to prove my sincerity.
Apologizing is a sign of strength - not weakness. Be strong and say I’m sorry for… then prove it by your actions."

We dined and danced, flirted and fought, made up under the sheets. We had the time of our lives.
Then she told me she fell in love with someone else. I’d come to believe that our separation wasn’t possible, but she was married within the month. Though this came as a shock to me, I felt that I shouldn’t show my pain. I fell deeply in love with her, and her happiness was far more important than my own. So I had to let her go without any fuss.
I left to travel the world, running from a hurt I couldn’t escape. No matter where I laid my head down, I’d dream of those melancholy eyes and pathetic smile. They became my nightmares. Four years after I learned that Jodie’s husband died in a car accident 6 months prior, I was saddened by this news but felt hopeful. She’d need someone to take care of her again.
It was really not a good idea, but I had to see her. The urge wouldn’t leave me alone: it was like when you urgently needs to pass gas while at a formal dinner party. Letting loose means humiliating yourself, but you can’t stop yourself. I finally gave in and returned home.
Jodie happily accepted my request to see her. I showed up at her house for a drink, and we talked about old times. She looked exactly the same, and I felt the same strange attraction we shared--appealing and dangerous.
I settled on the idea of asking her to dinner as our conversation slowed and the reunion came to an end. Before I could ask, a tall, handsome man entered the room, holding the hand of a beautiful little girl of about 4 years old who had the same melancholy eyes and pathetic little smile. The only difference in those little-girl eyes was their color: hers were the same pale blue as mine.
Smiling innocently, Jodie introduced her new husband and her daughter to me, then bid me goodbye. I swiftly gave my regards and departed."

“Yes, Dad.”
I noticed she seemed apprehensive. “Are you OK?” I asked. “If you’d rather not go, we can still cancel. I’m sure they’d understand.”
“Yeah right, and have my whole class laugh at me? Please. I’m just nervous about my flight. That’s all.”
“I understand,” I told her. “I was a nervous wreck the first time I flew, but don’t worry. Even though you probably don’t believe it now, you’ll most likely sleep most of the way. When you wake up, you’ll be there, and then you’ll have so much fun that you won’t remember the flight.”
Diane handed lilly her luggage. “Here you go, honey. Have a great trip. Don’t forget to call as soon as you check into the hotel.”
We all exchanged hugs and kisses, then Lilly headed for the door. I called after her, “Take lots of pictures!” She looked back with a smile and wave, and then she was through the door and gone, blending in with the airport crowd.
On the way home, I noticed Diance seemed quieter than usual. “You OK, babe?” I asked.
“I’m just thinking about Lilly. I’m sure it’s just because it’s her first time she’s been away from home, but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s going to happen to her.”
“Don’t worry,” I said. “Look how many times I’ve flown across the country for work. Smooth sailing every time. Well, except for that one time…” Diane gave me a look that says “you’re not helping.” I took her hand and said, “Look. If it makes you feel better, this isn’t easy for me either. It just seems like yesterday she was four years old, climbing up in my lap and begging me to read her those princess stories she had. Remember those? I must’ve read her those at least a thousand times! Now my own little princess is almost grown up and about to graduate high school. But I’m telling you she’ll be fine. SHe’ll come home with all kinds of stories and probably talk our ears off for hours.”
Diane gave me a sad smile and sighed. “You’re probably right. It’s hard to believe our little girl isn’t so little anymore.”
It was well after midnight by the time we got home. We were both pretty wiped out and headed straight for bed. The following morning, I let Diane sleep in while I raided the kitchen. I thought she would enjoy breakfast in bed for a change. However, when I brought her food,s he only picked at it, and I don’t think the problem was my cooking.
“Still have that bad feeling about Lilly?” I asked, rubbing her shoulders.
“Yeah, worse than last night. I thought she’d call by now. Maybe I better try calling her phone.”
“Well, they probably just landed,” I said. “The flight itself is over 7 hours long, and I’m sure they were delayed last night because of the rain. It wouldn’t surprise me if they were just checking in now. Give her another hour or so before you try calling. Meanwhile, I’ll clean up this mess.”
I gathered up the dirty breakfast dishes and headed for the kitchen. I heard the TV in the bedroom come on; my wife was getting her morning dose of Fox News. Moments later, I heard a shriek from the bedroom, and so I dropped the dishes and ran to see what was going on. I found Diane with her hands pressed to her face as she sat on the bed and stared eyes wide open at the TV. “What is it?!” I cried.
She pointed toward the TV which showed a reporter standing in front of a hellish scene of twisted metal and smoking ruins.
“In breaking news this morning,” the reporter announced, “USA Flight 119 has crashed while on approach to London’s Heathrow Airport. All aboard are feared dead…”"

Something was off. The froze in place, trying to put a finger on just what it was that wasn’t right.
Quiet. It was too quiet. His brothers and sisters were a high-spirited bunch who could be heard in any part of the house. But now? All he heard was...quiet.
Something was wrong. You could feel it in the air. He didn’t know what to do. His instincts were screaming at him to leave. To get help. If only he had listened.
He tip-toed to the kitchen. There were pots on the stove. There were books and homework scattered on the table, The radio was playing. There was no one there. He turned the radio off and tip-toed into the living room. He didn’t see anything out of place, but he still didn’t see anyone. He tip-toed up the stairs. He had snuck up and down these stairs a million times, so he was able to avoid the creaky spots on stairs 3 and 5 and get to the top without a sound. He went to his sister’s room first. They weren’t there. Next, he went to his brother’s room. Still, there was no one in sight. He thought he heard a noise in his parents’ room, so he rushed for the door. As his hand touches the doorknob, pain in his head exploded and everything turned to black.
When he woke up Eugeine saw red. Literally. There was so much blood. He saw his family, but they weren’t moving. He somehow knew they were already gone. He felt it in his spirit.
As he was surveying the destruction around him, a boot stepped into his line of view. Then he was looking into a pair of eyes. He could see all the way through those eyes. What he saw was pure evil. There were full of hatred and anger. They raised the hairs all over his body. As the man showed Eugeine his knife, Eugeine told him “I will come back for you. You will pay.” Those were Eugeine’s last words.
Where do I come into the story? Am I the family pet who saw it all? No. Not even close.
After Eugeine’s last words, everything went dark. Then there was such a lightness, he wanted to stay that way forever.Then he remembered in his spirit the sight of his family, his last words, and those eyes. Suddenly, he felt confined. He could barely move. He felt movement around him though. It felt as though he was being pushed. All of a sudden he was free, but so cold. He couldn’t see. Where was he? What was going on? Had it all been a bad dream?
When he was finally able to open his eyes, he couldn’t have been more shocked. This couldn’t be right. He was a dog! That’s right - I am Eugiene - or I was Eugiene, at least. I’m not exactly sure who I am now, but I know I am a dog. Perfect!
During the first few months of my life I nursed from my canine mother, played with my canine brothers and sisters, and grew stronger by the day. Being a dog isn’t so bad. It is much more liberating than being a human. When I was strong enough, I was ready to do what I was born into this body to do. I found my old home. It was cleaned up and had a “For Sale” sign out front. It looked like it hadn’t been lived in after my family. I found my way in through a cracked window. Our scent was everywhere. My mother. My father. My brothers and sisters. Me. We were everywhere in the house. Rather than get lost in the despair that was washing over me, I focused on the task at hand.
I went to my parent’s bedroom- the place where I, as Eugeine, took my last breath. It was then, at that very moment, that I realized why I came back as a dog. As a human, I would have been incapable of finding the man who murdered my family and I. As a dog, however, I had a powerful nose and had no problem picking up the scent of our murderer. Once I had the scent and knew I wouldn’t forget it, I was off. The scent led me through the neighborhood, down a dirt road, and through the woods. The scent led me to the porch of a cabin in the woods. To a pair of boots- the boots I last saw as Eugeine.
As I rounded the back of the property, I spotted my prey. He was feeding his chickens. He saw me and started yelling at me to get away from his chickens. He thought I was there for them? Stupid man! I wasted no time and pounced on the man, knocking him on his back. As I stood on his chest, I looked into his eyes. In that moment, I could see directly into his soul and I believe he looked directly into mine because his face turned to shock and disbelief. In that last moment of his life, I truly believe he recognized me by my eyes.
I took his boots and laid them on our family plot my family and I are buried in. I did what I came to this life to do. I’m finished. Now I can join my family. We can be at peace now. Goodbye world. Perhaps I will see you again. You will know me by my eyes."

I was better than the average athlete, but I quit the team when I dropped what would have been the game winning touchdown. My first crush left me, up goes the wall, higher and higher. It did not occur to me then that everyone's first love leaves and life goes on. I only felt the fiery blistering of my little broken heart, a few bricks more I add to my wall.
Deep within my gloom,
I touch no one,
And no one touches me.
I tried mild drugs, smoked a little weed, and drank a little alcohol. I let my hair grow long, got a few too many close calls, and landed myself in jail. In any case, I felt shunned, started hanging out with rougher crowds. Enough bricks now, I am an island, alone in this world.
I am a rock
I am an island.
The next thing that happened was a more serious crime, which resulted in a more serious sentence. I could only see my walls now, so high that people could not reach in to help me, and I could not reach out. My fortress destroyed me and my island insured that destruction. As pretty as my walls were, as intriguing as my wonderful island had become, it was all in fact, my own undoing.
And a rock feels no pain,
And an island never cries.
Now, instead of my walls surrounding me for protection, my island is isolating me. I am surrounded by real bars, real brick walls, and real razor wire. Not to keep others out, if only that were true; but, to keep me in, in, in, for so, so, long.
And a rock feels no pain,
And an island never cries.
Even so, I have learned that people need people, that sometimes growing is not always kind, and that adversity is only a building block for a better future."

How many hallways will your castle have? How can you get into the minds of fellow Prisoner Express addicts like Scratchpaper Castle got into your mind?
Loco-Motive Six-Six-Six does bring you to Scratchpaper Castle. It doesn’t take you back. You never have to worry about catching the train to get home. There’s a much simpler process for that. Notice something about the fountains. They’re pretty but they’re only fountains such as you see on Terra. Dip your hand, then bring a palmful of water water to your mouth as if you’d drink it. Notice how the water glimmers, shines and almost seems to be alive with changing colors? Notice the water in the fountain doesn’t do that? It’s your touch that causes the Rainbow Fountain to show its true colors. Likewise it’s your touch that will make your contributions to Prisoner Express glitter, sparkle and glisten. Now sip that palmful of water from the Rainbow Fountain.

I awoke clear-headed from my nap. My left hip was mildly protesting the position on the concrete under the Airline Drive overpass. I rose, stretched the kinks, then picked up my still-cool Dr. Pepper. My stroll back to The Shack gave me time to put the puzzle pieces in their places. My obligation had been fulfilled. I’d ridden the train, as was my duty. But what, if anything more than you’ve read was I expected to have brought back from Scratchpaper Castle? Then what was I expected to do with whatever I had brought back?
Mail had been delivered at The Shack. A manila envelope with my name and address block-printed in blue marker awaited. In the return address was a smiley face drawn in pink marker. Pink and blue was about to give me answers. Unwanted answers

Being cussed out and having my freedom threatened with a disciplinary case is coupled with her guarantee that any case she writes goes “platinum” and will have the worst possibly grading and punishment, because she knows who runs the cases. When the only offense I am truly guilty of is trying to stay out of trouble and do my job, the incentives to do even that is dulled, if no matter what I do I am going to be punished. I might as well go out with a bang! No, even though I get bitter over this, allowing her to get to me would mean she wins, and that alone is sometimes enough to help me maintain my calm.
However, the main and sole thing that allows me to keep my calm consistently in these situations is to remind myself only I can control myself, that I should not allow a person who does not matter to anyone, least of all her own self, influence me negatively in any way. I just have to do what I am supposed to do and hopefully, if I am patient, I can wait it out. Or even better, she will be caught for the illegal activities she enacts and no one will have to deal with her again.
I believe that everything you do is because of the beliefs that drive your thinking. It is hard to pin down and change those beliefs, but it is not impossible. You have to work at it. Most things that used to upset my calm, over the years, I have taught myself to ignore. If you train your mind to believe something is not worth becoming upset about, then it is not. I know my state of mind is my choice. I still have difficulties, but with the amount of practice I am putting in, I should master it soon enough. No matter what, the goal is keeping calm."

But who cares, in society’s eyes 18 was an adult
I felt I was one that knew everything
I could do whatever I wanted
Hello there to adulthood
I would soon learn that adulthood would have consequences
Most of all there would be fun…
“Let’s party,” said the 32 yr old man.
That “party” turned into moving in with him
Good-bye to school and graduation
Hello there to a new relationship
Even though he wasn’t my “type” of guy, he had alcohol and weed
That made up for his poor looks to me
Hello there to my love affairs
All my insecurities were gone for the moment
For a while it was fun “partying” everyday
Hello there to trouble
Soon after I’d be covering up for him
I’d take the blame
Good-bye to my clean record
Hello there handcuffs
Underage drinking? But I’m 18
Hello there to my first visit to jail
Then there was a day that I thought was a “normal party day”
It turned into something new
“What is it?” I asked
“Just try it,” he told me
The white rock looked appealing to me
I was up for anything that would make me feel good
Hello there, my name is crack cocaine
The first hit of poison would cause me years of trouble and pain
In my eyes I had a new best friend
The white pony
Hello there new friend
I’ll always be here for you
I’ll take away your pain
I’ll take away anything that’s troubling you
Even if you try to turn me away, I’ll be there saying,
“Hello there I know you want me”
I just won’t tell you all the bad things that comes with me
Hello there to lies, deceit, pain and broken relationships
Hello there to more physical abuse
I really thought it was a sign of love
Better to be abused than no attention, right?

Kevin walks past Tom walking all the way to the stone door which has a black opening, and he grins and says “It’s dark as hell, I’ll be back Tom if I don’t back call my wife and tell her that I love her and her food sucks.” Tom only smiles a little and says real fast “Kevin I don’t like this let’s call it in first and then send someone else”.

He reaches out toward the back pocket and pulls out a small flashlight and points it down the perfect white stone steps. He yells out to Tom, “It’s a stairway and it’s fucking long way down.” Right then a large flash of blue light comes at Kevin killing all sound and blasts out the door making Billy and Tom step back.
Tom yells out for Kevin but no answer comes and Billy runs up toward the doorway and cries “Captain are you OK?” Without thinking Billy runs in the doorway vanishing into the dark hole. Tom tried to say no but could not find his voice. Then it came once more a light so bright that it knocked Tom down to his knees, he lay there on the stone steps looking and crying out this doorway, yelling out their names each by first and last names.
Six weeks later state and government put up signs warning people to stay away. No one still has come to find out what is down there, but nine months later Kevin walks out of the Doorway, only he can’t turn or haiv almost like he’s dumbfounded.

If their taxes are reduced by 10%, that company keeps $20 billion of their own money - and that is why our economy is booming right now - and that’s not all! By eliminating a bunch of regulations, companies save hundreds of billions of dollars per year by not having to fork it up to ghost regulating agencies who donate huge portions of those billions back to the political hacks who helped them get it - so they all get richer. I can hear them now, “Oh it’s just crumbs. Give it to us!” but what happens if we vote against tax increases?
Less taxes means each home has more money every week. Corporations have more money. We have an economic boom. More jobs are created. Raises are given. Retirement plans increase. Political hacks don’t have a reason to keep raising our taxes, and our brothers, sisters, Moms and Dads, and Grandma, don’t have to keep getting laid-off just so millionaires will keep getting richer, eating steaks, drinking $500 dollar bottles of wine and wearing $1000 suits and dresses while the people who they taxed to get the money eat hamburger helper, drink cheap beer, and wear dollar store clothes.
I absolutely am not against all subsidies. I do understand how tariffs, taxes, and subsidies can be used rightly and can be beneficial to the world and to our country - to everyone! Including Grandma. It’s happening right now in our economy; but the subsidy given to GM can never be construed as being a good deal. I don’t care if it was a conspiracy to dupe the tax-payers, or if it was stupid economic decisions made by stupid politicians, or if it was ust a poor business model. What it was is $11.5 billion that went into whose pockets? And from whose pockets?
It’s as if me, you, and everybody’s Grandma threw $50 each into a big pile - and when it added up to $11.5 billion, we just gave it to a bunch of old rich cronies who don’t care if we live or die.
So, what would have happened if we had just let GM fail and file bankruptcy, and lay-off all their workers instead of giving them a subsidy? The millionaires would retire with $40 million each instead of 60. America would still have $11.5 billion to benefit the taxpayers who paid it, and there would have been no excuse to make us pay more taxes. Smarter people with modern business models would buy out GM, upgrade and expand their factories, re-hire all those skilled laborers who were laid-off; give better insurance plans, 401 K options, and other perks. In short- the free market would have corrected itself.
Where GM failed to have the talent it takes to function in today’s market, like millions of other companies are successfully doing, we will have gotten rid of GM’s burden on our society. We would still get their vehicles - probably with newer and better upgrades at affordable prices and we would get it from better owners whose business model didn’t rely on government handouts that require increased taxes.
In closing, I’d say that tariffs (which is taxation) is good when it is designed to benefit our country while establishing comparable benefits for other countries. Internationally, when our tariffs are far lower than the tariffs other countries charge us, then we are at an economic disadvantage; and by increasing our tariffs on those other countries, it forces them to renegotiate better trade deals and to stop taxing us three times more than we tax them. It means they will adjust their tariffs on us so that they are equal or similar to those we place on them. It means that trade is fair; and all of our businesses who have international dealings, including the automobile industry, will pay lower taxes. It means they will have lower production costs. There will be an increase in supply and lower demand. Domestically, taxes can be used to benefit everyone, like having a strong military - or by subsidizing soybean farmers while we are in the middle of renegotiating international trade deals; but I think very few people out of our entire population profited anything at all off of the subsidy to GM - and the few who did were or complete government control - using tariffs to renegotiate trade deals that had us at an economic disadvantage, and the lowering of domestic taxes so that we all have more money to buy more cars and trucks - that was a viable option 10 years ago; and if the powers that be would have done that, then the economic boom we are having right now would have happened then, and with that better policy, Hillary Clinton could have been our President."

My entire upper torso was stiff and numb. For several days many doctors come to examine me, but then one day they don’t. Two weeks after the surgery, finally, my young pretty nurse asked me “who’s supposed to come and take you home?” I tell her, “my group home.” She then begins to call and call and call. Around 9:00 PM she reaches someone and informs them that they should have been there to pick me up a week ago. They filled the van and began their trek.
It was close to midnight when I was wheeled out and loaded into the Blue Goose. They, for some reason, packed the van to the brim with rowdy kids. Not cool! The driver was unfamiliar with the outskirts that lead away from the highway. Running pretty late he decides to take a “shortcut” off of the safe highway toward the pitch black nowhere. Low and behold we get lost and there is nothing out there, including no cell phone reception.
It’s freezing cold in the back of the old van, and then suddenly we become engulfed in a blanket of dense fog, forcing the imagination to think it’s colder. Life sucked for me at this moment. The boys are jumping and screaming, having fun, and we are lost. A glow from a distance luminates our destination for help. Driving carefully to stay on the invisible road, our driver navigates us to the promised land. Everyone, including me, shouts for joy upon arrival to the factory of some sort. It being late nobody was expected to be there, but somewhere on the grounds should be a phone.
Erin, the vegetarian counselor, courageously took the challenge to seek out the phone on foot as we continued to drive the van around. Simultaneously, her on foot, us on Blue Goose, we converge on an open door to one of the warehouses. Our headlights help guide Erin to the inside. Her trip is short lived, as seconds later she’s seen running back to the van screaming. She’s blubbering so bad we can’t understand her. “Horses! Horses! They’re all dead!” the repeated words she cried out. The driver gets out to further investigate the tragic ordeal.
More composed, but still a bit shocked, he returns. He begins to tell us, while vegetarian Erin is still in tears, that we found a horse meat factor, and inside the warehouse tables are full of all sorts of horse body parts. Conveniently, the heads were placed right near the entrance, all looking at the intruders who dared. They selfishly refused to allow us boys to venture out to see the horror they got to witness. The rest of the way in the deep fog; finally, hours later we emerge out of it to find our home."

A very sincere, loyal, and loving person. And always exposing all from actions to feelings. Never one to hide who I really am and being able to know and accept real life, and its trials and tribulations, I thought if I tried hard enough and keep it 100% legit with all my family and poured all my love back into my family that we would spread that love so that we resurrect that unity, loyalty, friendship, laughter, and tears.
But the closest I got to a family reunion since the death of my great grandmother was prison release parties that were thrown for one of my cousins, brothers or my dad that got released. Times had changed dramatically, my family of love, unity, etc. was gone. Replaced with hate, abandonment, drugs, and fear. Growing up without that love leads to a life on the streets and a life of crime, which comes with the territory of the wrong people and wrong places.
The last release party was not a good one. There were drugs, booze, loose actions, and people. Fights broke out involving the cousin who just got released. I stepped in. and things ended badly. One died, one went home, and I came to prison. It's sad because we were all close family and friends and just trying to have that unity, loyalty, laughter, and tears of a reunion. I guess when I look back we had every one of those things. So I guess we did get what we asked for in a Family Reunion.
This just goes to show how much the people, places, and things of the world change. When my grandmother died, her olden golden family morals and values died with her. Things will never be like they once were in the old days; no matter how I tried to rebuild what once was, it would never be the same. Eventually, my time will come, and I’ll be released back into the world. I will have that option of a “Family Reunion.” I think I’ll break the cycle this time and avoid a reunion. I want to go somewhere and start over hopefully to raise my own family, and at that point, I can try to instill that olden golden morale with the values that my grandmother and grandfather have or had. I want others to experience the same feelings of love, family, unity, and laughter that I felt as a kid. I would give anything to go back to that time and place of a hard-working, and loving family. The sights sounds, and smells of togetherness and love. Damn what a beautiful memory!"

He did not rely on my grandparents to raise us. We were soon in our own home.
My dad had to hire a babysitter, of course. He worked long hours then relieved the babysitter when he came home to us. My dad was there for us when no one else was. He went without so he could provide for his children.
My dad stayed up some nights and some days when we were sick. We cried for “daddy” when we were hurt or in need. Dad made countless breakfasts, lunches, and dinners for us. Dad was the birthday-cake baker and surprise maker.
Dad celebrated our accomplishments and helped us with homework. He took us to practices, appointments, school functions, etc. Dad even became a little league coach for us. He did all he could to raise a little girl right. She’s a well-adjusted mom of two kids now.
My dad never acted as if he considered himself extraordinary for doing a loving parent’s duties. These actions are expected of a parent, not just a mom. My dad eventually found a loving woman who would take on a ready-made family, but even then he remained a good dad.
Unfortunately, I never vocalized my gratitude to my dad about his many sacrifices and ever-enduring love for his children. He might never, in this world, know of my gratitude, but the world can know. My gratitude would make me nominate my dad for a “father hall of fame” if one existed. I appreciate my dad being a dad. My gratitude can only attempt to equate to his love."

He will not relent. He has kept me in his thoughts, his prayers, and his most precious memories.
This city is so expansive. When I stare through this glass I find myself confronted with the honest truth that his treacherous, perilous trek, by all accounts, should be impossible to complete. The journey has taken him so long, taxing us both in excess of our breaking points. Yet, I know that over the horizon, beyond the distance of my visual perceptions, he perseveres.
The world will not hold him. It can not hold him. This realm simply is not immense enough. The time will come when I will look up and he will be here. I have imagined many times what I might say to him; what he might say to me.
I will tell him that he is my past, that he has lost me and any and all opportunity of resurrecting my love or affection. Then he will tell me that he still loves me, and that I am his everything. He will vow to me that the thoughts of me in his arms was the only source of courage and will he was able to salvage to grant him the strength he needed to survive all that they had set before him. He will profess that he has come for me; that he can make it all better. My hurt, my shame, my loss, my anger- my love.
I have heard them claim that time flies, but for us, it has crawled. I find my comfort in the assurance that he is one-track-minded. He will not veer from his course. He is an arrow loosed upon a battlefield and he flies true.
I on the other hand, from my window perched up high, feel as if I’m falling… falling towards the wings of the great phoenix, the firebird of lore. It is there where he will catch me up into the whirlwind of his flight and return me to the glory of my throne. This city and the world beyond think to thwart his efforts. However, I‘ve known for so long the one thing they never have. They are ill equipped to defy his rise. For they have never witnessed one fly from the shaft of a bow. No, time does not fly, but I know that he most certainly does, and I am his target. They would be wise to vacate his path."

The reason for my direct motive within this social resuméof communication, I read a paper that I researched, that prisoner express promotes and offers inmates information, education and the opportunity for self expressions in a public forum, and as well coordinates a pen pal program, and distance learning programs…

T mind being a part of the pen pal program that prisoner express coordinates; I got a lot of good energy I write, I write around the country to different workshops, strong voices, universities, and students, I write motivational moments like I started off the letter with, and reality poetry, which I’ve place inside a demonstration of my poems as strong messages of life and reality, one called “Incarceration Nation” a glimpse of reality from the concrete and steel, my creative world of thought, the other one called “Real Strong Voices”, which I wrote back in 2005, some say I’m before my time, it's a feel to what you see what’s going on with the country today, with the youth and need the “truth” to make knowledge and wisdom to make strong progress, I hope you’ll feel the good energy when you get into the poem messages…
I write different creative formats and paint pictures with words when emerged into my freedome zone of mind…(ya feel me!)

I hope I can get into some creativity at prisoner express distant programs and pen pal program, it’s a reason “why” I started this letter off with that motivational moment, Say hit Dr.Stephen at the University of Colorado on web page.
Well prisoner express reader, I’ve passed my main intention, I’m getting too close with this called “Passion In Leaders”
When inner directed “energy, self governance, leadership and responsibilities” are “nurtured” in teachers and community leaders, “inspiring” them to “act with passion and firm knowledge” for “wisdom”, while affirming their “human ability”, the changes may come toward “new development” and “progress” of shapen the world with education and strong creative minds, we as people must also wonder about a condition that “afflicts” those of the struggle and young generation who seek “education and knowledge” and what they are “aiming” for out of life, the best passionate leaders are those who are most beneficial towards others in a good way, then passion “show and demonstrate the motions of what’s in the “heart” as realness to reach a mission of a new blessing and new chapter of life with a passion of a leader…

The CO has returned for the tray. Somehow my celly managed scarf all his food down in less than a couple of minutes. He burps loudly.
It’s amazing what we’re able to endure when we have no choice. I don't even notice the stench of this place anymore. I’m somehow able to block out the relentless noise and sleep through the blinding, ever present light.
4:00 A.M.
With nothing else to do, I go back to bed. I ponder if I came to prison as my punishment or for punishment.
7:00 A.M.
It’s Saturday, yard day. Today we got two or three hours outside on a concrete slab. We make sure our cell is in compliance and stand eagerly by the cell door. I;m starting to feel like the family Beagle waiting to be let out.
7:30 A.M.
Still waiting. I’m starting to get nervous. Palms sweating and biting my nails.
8:00 A.M.
We got the bad news. Yard is cancelled – apparently three was a light drizzle. Without a window I have no way to confirm or dispute it. I’m upset, this makes three weeks in a row. I need some fresh air. I need to see the sun. I need out of this 8x10 sinkhole.
8:30 A.M.
I read. I read anything I can get my hands on. I don’t discriminate. I’m not too good for an urban novel and won’t why away from a historical nonfiction text either. I average two hundred pages a day. I don’t know what I would do if I couldn't read. My family sends me books. I request books from various organizations that donate books to prisoners. I trade for books; book for book or sometimes meal tray for book.
*They say there is a prison library book cart, but I think it’s just a jail house myth.
Today I’m reading a George Washington biography. I’m on page 240 of 678, I should be able to finish it by the weekend. Frankly, it’s much more interesting than I thought it would be.*
10:30 A.M.
Cock-in-a-sock (encased sausage) and beans: lunch. I pick through the beans and before eating, last week I chipped my tooth on a pebble.
11:00 A.M.
Workout. Push ups, sit ups, burpees, and squats. I wish I could do more but I’m limited by my tiny cell. Also, our deficient diet isn’t conducive to muscle growth – I tire quickly.
Noon
The nurse is on our desk passing out meds. It seems as if half the prison is on some type of medication. I one considered faking “crazy” in order to get some psych meds that could help me sleep. I still think about it sometimes. My celly is at the door trying to steal a peek. He’s a “gunner” (someone who masturbates when woman walks down the tier). We’ve talked about it. He knows how I feel about it. We look at each other waiting for it to pop off. It’s torture just being in the cell with him.
*He’s a bug (weird, demented, odd, institutionalized). I’m pretty sure he has PTSD. He’s been locked up for over twenty seven years, many of those in max solitary. He gets panic attacks and is paranoid that “they’re listening”. He often talks to himself (and answers himself) and has mentioned suicide more than once. Last week he went to the boom boom room (suicide watch room) where they stripped him down and watched him for three days. He said he spent most of his time masturbating to the nurses coming to check on him.
1:00 P.M.
Cleaning time. I scrub out the toilet to wash my sheets and clothes. I take a thorough bird bath in the sink. I mop the floor and wipe down the walls with a rag. I’ve become OCD since arriving to prison.
1:30 P.M.
The animals are awake. My cell stands on the sink to yell in the vent and talk to his buddies in the cell below us. He send and receives kites (notes) via lines thrown out our chuck holes tangled together with other inmate lines. He knows how to “jail” (used as a verb). He can “pop the cuck” (open our feeding ports from the inside) and knows all the angles to get what he wants.
3:00 P.M.
The neighbor decides to “shut it down” (making so much noise it’s impossible for inmates to talk or hear each other). I’m grateful.
4:00 P.M.
It’s our shower day – once a week for ten minutes. I grab my shower shoes, can’t forget them, last month I found a steaming pile of shit in the shower. The water starts out freezing cold and quickly heats up to scorching hot making it virtually impossible to get all the soap out of my hair and eyes before the CO is back to escort me back to my cell.
4:15 P.M.
I return to my cell to find my celly pasting magazine pages over our overhead light. It’s against regulation and could cost us a ticket, but I understand so I don’t say anything. He’s stuck on the top bunk, just inches from the blaring light and constant buzzing twenty four hours a day.
4:30
Dinner. More cold slop. I check the veggie mix for insects and insect parts. I spill some fruit juice. It quickly stains the cement floor – I wonder what they put into the stuff.
I save some bred in case my pet comes to visit tonight: a baby mouse. I think he’s given up on me. I don’t usually have any food for him. It’s funny I used to have a strong aversion to rodents – prison cured me.
Well, that’s it for food or movement for the day.
6:00 P.M.
I’m tired of reading, but not tired enough to fall asleep. I day dream. I imagine different realities. I’m not in prison. I go back in time and make different choices. In my dreams I still matter.
7:30 P.M.
Mail call. I have nothing to send out, but anxiously await any incoming mail. I love getting mail, but am also anxious about what it might be. I don’t think I can handle any more bad news: a death in my family, a denial of some sort, a confiscation notice.
Nothing. It’s both a relief and a stab in the heart.
I start to obsess about a letter I’m waiting for from my family. Are they mad at me? I rerun every conversation we’ve had and dwell on any slight. I feel abandoned. Buried alive.
10:00 P.M.
My day is over – nothing left to look forward to.
I pray.
I slip off to another dreamless slumber."

They came with weapons of such we did not possess. They burned our huts and we ran out. The weapons they had sent small pieces of metal that pierced through our bodies, killing many instantly. The young men tried to fight back, but our weapons were only farming tools, no match against the weapons the white face strangers used to massacre every man in our village. Man women and children were killed as well.
Once they gained control of the village, it was just women and children left alive. We were forced to sit huddled together with the weapons pointed at us. They were all yelling at us. Then two of them grabbed Kemi and dragged her away from us as she fought back. They began to beat her and tear her clothes off until she was nude. One by one the other men grabbed us, even our daughters as young as ten years of age. The rapes lasted for hours as they took turns one after another as they got drunk. This type of horror our people have never experienced; only the devil could do such a thing especially to a child. I turned my face to Kemi to let her know that she should be strong as a drunken white face strange man forced his way inside of me. I watched as the light in Kemi’s eyes went out, her moans and cries of pain went silent and her movement stopped. Kemi was dead, but the white face stranger continued pushing himself in and out of her innocence that was no more. I closed my eyes wishing that I was somewhere else. The pain between my legs numbed after an hour of being raped. I stopped counting how many men after the seventh one. I just closed my eyes as tight as I could and let them do what they wanted hoping they would not kill me.
Maybe two or three hours later it seemed to be over. They all had fallen asleep around us. Some still laying on top of the woman or girl they raped. I looked around for my daughter Ma-ling. She was not too far away from me, tears flowing down her face. I looked around to see if it was safe. I didn’t see any of the white face strangers standing or away, so I crawled over to Ma-ling and carefully picked up the knife the man must have held to Ma-Ling’s throat while he raped her. I signaled for Ma-Ling to be quiet as I lifted the man’s head who was laying on top of my daughter. And just as his eyes opened looking directly into Ma-Ling’s eyes, I cut his throat before he could make a sound.
We all did the same to as many of these devils as we could as they slept for what they did to us and for murdering our sons and men. We all moved silently but quickly as we covered our nude bodies with clothing. We escaped and are now traveling inside the canals of the swamps in the woods with the tall grass to hide us from the white face strangers. When they awake and see that we are gone and what we did before we left they will be angry and surely want to find us and kill us all. We have been traveling inside the swamps for two hours and we are very tired, but the fear will not let us rest or stop. Ma-Ling has clung to me and has not said one word, but I can see the terror and desperation in her eyes and face, wanting to get somewhere safe. And what has happened to her and all of the girls and women in our village we will never forget.
The first light of morning has entered the sky so we are no longer protected by the dark as shelter to hide us from the new enemies that will come look for us soon. We are not too far from the Nugieyn Clan. They are warriors and not farmers like us. So we must warn them of this evil that has entered our land and tell them what they did to our people and village so that they can be ready and spread the word to the other clans and come together as a unit to drive these white face devils back into the sea and to wherever they come from. These evil white face strangers that claimed to come in peace."

Could he be wrong as to her motive being here? Was there something behind that smile he could not glean?
Oh great. Now worry opened the road for fear and paranoia to rush in. Apprehension about himself that he was unable to embrace the simplicity of reconciling as a step towards a better tomorrow. Where does this go from here? What’s the right path for this to go onward? God help him, he loved this woman, and did not want to lose her again to stupidity, arrogance and selfishness.
When the phone rang three weeks ago, he reluctantly picked up the receiver expecting another demand from collections—times were hard now. But, there was her voice on the other end. Reaching out to tug at his heartstrings, and for the life of him, he could not recall one word either of them shared. He only knew she would be here today because he wrote it down in rapturous haste. On the ride here, she briefed him on seeing her mother, and she too felt it was right to reach out to him.
How could she find it in her heart to forgive? After all he had done? Where’s the bitterness expected after all these years? Hadn’t he warranted a permanent exile from all she would accomplish in life? How does he thank her for this second chance?
She asked him if this was his usual place lately. It was. Here they were. The forgotten years full of unknowns now tentatively being coaxed into the open, she seemed as hesitant as he in how far or fast the reach went. Hadn’t she given more though? She went the distance just by calling, right?
The marquee on the façade promoted “The Piano Man” was to be on stage tonight. He remembered from long ago her love for the ivory keys, her heart alit when the felt-tipped hammers hit the taut strings, bringing harmony from a cacophony. Could she suspect why they were here tonight? He used to be able to read her so well. Not anymore. But, it’s time now.
Time for “The Piano Man” to take the stage. Hope coursed through his veins that she might know she is who the songs will be for tonight. In his heart, the notes were only for his Lilly.
He arose leaving her sitting there, alone. For the first time in this new start, he was again causing confusion and distress to mar and with her beautiful smile. His glance back was meant to give her reassurance he wasn’t going far.
The piano was there. Waiting.
For him.
Those years after losing her from his own failing nearly drove him to suicide. Only by embracing her other love she held carried him through dark valleys of depression and gut wrenching agony from bouts of self-recrimination and hate. All negativity purged as he learned to caress the ivory black and whites into singing his solitude away, instead of drinking to forget. Piano was his medicine and penance for his sins.
The bench felt like home now, and she was finally going to hear him play for her. His daughter would listen to all his apologies. Not from his knees, but from the notes he played tonight. They would have extra weight from the thanks of being given this chance by her. Tonight, these men who had come to weep into their beer would, instead, hear healing and have knowledge that strength to reconnect to that which is lost still exists.
He looked over to her, winked, and looked at the keys lost to the moment now. They were dancing at her wedding. They sat by the bayou fishing off a doc, the waters lapping against the pillars. Grandchildren running around as family reunions commenced. Her hand holding his as he exhaled his last.
Possibilities to come.
A new world before them. Endless and all within his grasp now. The wisps of his thoughts echoing from the stage as the lights fell to start the show."

They say it’s not adultery if you’re not wearing your wedding ring. Something tells me my wife will check if I’ve been wearing my wedding ring. I need to get some sun so I can have a tan line on my ring finger.
When my wife is close to town, she sends me another e-mail. I gave her our Bellagio suite number, I tell her to call me upon arrival. Security will not let her up by herself.
There is a knock on my suite door. I look in the peephole. It’s my wife. She should not have been able to come up without a valid room key. I have no way of knowing if the metro is just out of view or if my wife is by herself. She knocks again and says she knows I’m in there looking at her. I open the door. I see there is no one in the hallway. I ask my wife how she got past security. She says she sweet talked him. I keep thinking that metro or F.I.S.T. will kick down the door at any moment. I ask how she knows I’m at Bellagio. She says she looked at a U.S. map and figured out in twenty minutes.
My wife is inspecting our suite. Something tells me that she’s looking for signs of another woman. She says she’s just looking at the suite since she hasn’t been to Bellagio before. She says I’ve gotten some sun, I say it’s sunny every day so you have no choice but to get some sun. She says my wedding ring looks dirty. She takes off my wedding ring. She sees I do have a tan line so obviously I have been wearing my wedding ring.
My wife brought my Cartier timepiece from home. She does like my Cartier eyeglasses but not my beard. She says I need to shave my beard before we have dinner at Le Cirque. I tell her I’m thinking dinner at Del Taco. I tell her it’s a lot better than Taco Bell. My wife says she didn’t travel all this way to have dinner at Del Taco.
My wife says I should come back home. I tell her there is a warrant for my arrest. After three weeks my wife goes back home. She takes my Cartier timepiece back home. I stay to continue my vacation. I start growing my beard again."

Boom!
A blue sky turns black. We small the acrid smoke. We see the gray and brown dust. The heat from the fire warms our skin. We taste blood in our mouths. Our ears don’t work; they just ring. Until we hear the screams.
We scramble towards the vehicle we were just in. Yeah, that boom just blew me and my buddies right out of the armored Hummer we were in.
Snap! Snap! Snap! Boom!
We are being shot at. And someone just fired an RPG at us. My gun is up. I shoot back as I scramble towards my guntruck.
The dust is like a fog. I run through it. React to contact. Fire and weave. Fire and weave.
At the truck I realize I’m alone. My “we” is just “me.” There are bodies everywhere. My friends. I shoot at phantoms in the hills. I reload. I reach into the back of my guntruck and pull someone out. No time to look and see who. Don’t need to. It doesn’t matter. The body is limp. I run through fire and deliver it to our medic at the truck about fifty yards behind me. I run back. Shoot and weave. I grab another body and run through the fire again. I shoot, I weave. I run with a buddy, not a body, again.
And I go in again.
On a nice summer day in the mountains I got all of my buddies clear. None of them were dead. Injured but alive. Now they say I’m a hero. I’m not. Just looked out for my friends. Instinct. You don’t think in moments like that.

“I climbed through a window.”
“Let us in,” one of the others said.
VANDALS: That’s when the vandalism began. I let them in. Stanley’s friends threw cans and jars of food that damaged the kitchen and cafeteria, then went to the high school gym and stole weights and sports equipment. One boy’s father asked his son, “Where did you get those weights?”
INFORMANTS: That was when the first state witness against me was born. According to the turncoat, confederate, he first lied, then got beat with a belt and confessed to his and our crimes. He told everyone involved. Off to juvenile we went, including the informant. The other kids blamed Stanley and me to make it easy on themselves: our parents had to pay more restitution because they did.
I didn’t have much trust in people before then since my brothers told Mother on me all the time. The arrest helped destroy the trust I had left. That arrest began a long line of crimes and arrests that ultimately lead to my writing straight from the pen about my favorite childhood dog.
JETS & PLANES: Some woods and the world’s busiest airport--Atlanta International Airport, as it was called in the early ‘60s--were behind the school. Before I was old enough to venture off into the woods or to cross the street to go to school, I stayed in our backyard playing with Tonka Toys, plastic dinosaurs, army men, Hot Wheels, and a variety of other toys, as I sniffed spent fuel from jets and planes flying over the neighborhood.
A DOG’S LIFE: More than anything, I loved spending time with Nikki, a Belgium shepherd and wolf mix that my dad brought home to me. Nikki listened to me when no one else would; he didn’t want to fight with me like my brothers, and he didn’t scream at or beat me like my mother did. He didn’t expect anything from me other than to be fed and petted. I never failed to live up to his expectations. We grew up together.
FRIENDS: I had friends, but Nikki was the best one. When my mom beat me, as she did on a regular basis, I ran outside to pout with my arms around Nikki. He understood my pain an dlicked my face to show he cared. If I fought with my brothers, which caused many beatings by Mother, I’d go outside and hug my true friend who accepted me as I was. We’d even hang out together in the basement to catch birds.
BIRDS IN A BOX: I made a trap from a stick, a long string, and a large cardboard box. I’d lure the birds into the box by sprinkling breadcrumbs near the inside edge and center of the trap. I had to keep Nikki behind me, inside the basement, to stop him from taking off to scare my prey.
DARN CATS: I laid on the steps leading down into the basement to hide from the view of the birds. When the birds entered the danger zone, I’d yank the string. Sometimes I won, sometimes, the birds. One time after I won, one of our cats stole the bird from me and ate it. Darn cats!NIKKI TOLD ON ME: My parents worked, my mother as a seamstress in a shirt factory and my father as a service station attendant. My mother’s mother lived with us, so that left my grandmother to care for me and my siblings while our parents were at work. She was the only grandparent I ever knew: all the others died before I was born in 1957.
Anytime she came to the back door and stood on the porch yelling my name to come eat, or for whatever other reason, she said Nikki would tell her where I was hiding. If I was up in an apple tree, he’d stand under it and wag his tail. If I went over the fence to vandalize the neighborhood, he’d run and stand at my point of departure. The problem came when he learned to climb the fence, too.
I was in third grade when Stanley rushed into the house, “Nikki got hit.” He was chasing Mr. Wheeler’s truck. He ran over him and kept going.”
I ran out of the house to where my best friend lay in the street, parts of him mangled from the tires that took his life. I was devastated for days. It screwed me up so bad that I laid out of school.
I dug a hole in the ground to place Nikki’s body. I wept at the loss of a non-judgemental friend whose spirit returned to the darkness where it roamed with its ancestors."

The good news was that the pedunculated tumor was palpable and could be manipulated through abdominal massages to eliminate the intestinal obstruction. I became proficient with this procedure in short order. Additionally, the other fibroid tumors could be safely removed with minimal potential complications for future pregnancies. The bad news was that there was no available data regarding the potential effects of the radiation on the developing fetus. Terminating the pregnancy was recommended. Although none of the six specialists consulted would perform the abortion, the all recommended the same gynecologist for the termination procedure.
It was the abortionist who gave us the first glimmer of hope on a very dark horizon. His recommendation was to wait eight weeks, watching for a potential miscarriage. In the absence of a miscarriage, a sonogram and amniocentesis would be performed to confirm or deny damage caused by the radiation exposure.
After another eight weeks of uncertainty, the sonogram revealed what appeared to be a fully, properly formed baby with all body parts accounted for. The amnio results revealed no identifiable defects and confirmed sonogram suspicions that this was a girl.
Our miracle baby was born in July of 1983, a beautiful little blue eyed blonde. Eighteen months later she had an active baby brother. Three months thereafter, Pam was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer, which took her from us in the summer of 1989. I was now the sole caregiver for five and six year old bundles of joy.
This arrangement lasted ten years. In 1999 the state decided that I should be in prison. For reasons beyond the scope of this missive, all contact with my children was effectively terminated. Now eighteen years later, my children are strangers to me. In the world of almost, I am, at best an “almost parent.” Certainly, I have sired offspring. But did I adequately satisfy the parental responsibility to mold his children into well-adjusted productive members of society? I don’t and probably won’t have the answer to that question due to my current circumstances. Then, of course, is the nagging question of what if Pam and I had chosen the recommended hysterectomy back in 1982? How would that one decision have changed the current course of my personal history? Needless to say, the world of almost is plagued with an endless list of “what ifs” that could change the results of any situation--be it a race, accident or relationship."

Pamela moved around a lot, and I followed my children from city to city. The insurance company sent me monthly itemizations of payments for medical care. My children were constantly being treated for injuries like a ruptured hymen or an amputated ear, or trauma related illnesses like costochondritis. I always knew what hospital they were near, and I could contact local police and schools.
Pamela admitted to the court that I’d been locating my children through medical reports. She said she wasn’t going to use my insurance anymore. The court made me continue the premium payments anyway.
Most of the local officials were in Pamela’s pocket, but after years of relentless effort, I received a lawful court order which Pamela’s lawyer advised her to ignore. On June 9, 1999, as I was preparing to file a contempt petition, I was again arrested.
I’ve been locked up for over 17 years.
A few years ago, I established my girls’ approximate locations and learned that all three of my children were in the Burlington area of Alamance County, North Carolina. Nonresident prison staff raided my legal papers and destroyed much of my information about my family and friends.
The Innocence and Justice Clinic of Wake Forest University School of Law located my son and tried to get in touch with him. They immediately received threatening phone calls from Pamela.
My children are full grown now, but they are still afraid of their mother (not without reason--most of my friends and family are dead or missing), but at least they know someone is watching them and that a father’s love is forever."

Desperation is an odd thing. It sniffs you out and sometimes stalks you like prey before you realize it is staring you in the face, waiting for you to make your move. It confronts us with this fight or flight approach at times when we least expect it and we are forced to make decisions to either play dead or play the hunter, chasing ambitions, passion, and purpose until they’re captured.
Courage, I now realize, is it’s natural enemy. It was in this moment of epiphany that the animal broke the look between us and looked around, nose to the wind as it perhaps seeking out some other poor fool in search of himself amidst a mountain in the middle of winter.

Once home, I went straight to my workshop. I traced the pentagrams in each quarter, then the rose crosses at each cross-quarter as well as above and below me. They flared brilliantly in my astral sight. From there, I censed the circle with Fire and Air, then aspersed it with Water and Earth. I called the energy of each element into the circle through the pentagrams, and from there drew it into my body. Preparations complete, I turned to the task at hand.

They needed enough mind to remember and follow orders, and improvise a bit to meet the situation, but not so much they became independent. They need the spark of life without a living soul. I had to make two golems, one of the most difficult operations in all magickal lore.
It took me longer than I imagined, drawing the currents of astral light through the hexagrams and currents of elemental force through the pentagrams and stranger currents through figures of non-Euclidean angles. But at last I was done. I watched the two explore their new world with their rudimentary senses, clumsy and curious. When I moved, their heads swiveled to watch and they mimicked me perfectly as I de-energized and took down the circle.
Over the next several weeks I trained them with a steady video diet of Olympic sprinting, parkour, and “American Ninja Warrior.” At night I would take them out and test their abilities. I’d time their runs and put magickal traps for them to avoid. When they started to meet my standards, I made it more difficult.
The night of their last run, they exceeded my best expectations. “Good, very good.” My praise sent them into an impromptu rendition of the Three Stooges routine. Perhaps I let them watch too much TV. Sometimes their behavior reminded me of Thing One and Thing Two, and I resolved to never let them see that movie. I never could break them of mimicking unnecessary actions, like bending over to catch their breath after a run even though they didn’t breathe. The wrong movie could give them too many bad habits, and I’d only reinforced the ones they had by laughing at their antics.
They were ready. I sent them out the next night.
The dynamic duo returned in the wee hours before dawn, proudly holding the large, heavy book between them; scarred, singed, and smelling of burnt falafel, oddly enough. I took the time, their blank, half-suggested faces peering at me hopefully.
“Well done. Very, very good.” They capered around me while I examined my new book. It was the right one, except for the locked clasp that held the cover together. That wasn’t supposed to be there. Obeah had certainly added that, and it was likely magicked to destroy the book if I attempted to pick it or bypass it. Well, at least I have the book and Obeah doesn’t, but…
I turned to my terrible two, placing a hand on their heads and drawing on their power until they shrank in on themselves returning to their original size. “Well done, faithful servants, sleep… sleep until I shall need you again, sleep until I have a new task for you.”"

Lilly was overly protective of her eggs, always was and always would be. If Sam were still around, Red would have received a good pecking just for broaching the subject.
“Who will watch your eggs this evening?” asked Red innocently.
Lily eyeballed him with a hiss.
“I am not planning on stealing your eggs,” barked Red, “I only want to be sure they are protected.”
Have you ever heard a goose harrumph? “Maggie Mallard and her clutch.”
“Well they are certainly loud enough.”
“Yes they are, and if they so much as quack once, all bets are off, your raid is a wash… agreed?”
“Most certainly,” yipped Redm “You brood is far more important.”
“Good. Then you best be off to plan everything. And don’t forget to put that wicker baby carriage in the middle for all to see.” With that Lilly Swan tucked her bill under her left wing.
Later that evening they waited in the tall grass. Red had been very busy recruiting his raiding party. The first headlights approached. Lilly Lake hushed. Only the breezy rustle of tall grass broke the silence. Even the shrill of crickets were absent on this suspenseful night. The wicker baby carriage stood ominous in the glow of the approaching headlights. Then another pair of headlights approached, the carriage shone brighter, then another and another. Car doors slammed, it was ike flies to a bug-light, the young humans gathered around the carriage. Soon the quiet night was alive with the murmurs of young humans, laughing and yelling, drinking and smooching, running and frolicking. The lake watched. The trees watched, The tall grass waited. If you poked at the tension in the air with a stick, it would have broke.
Red gave the signal, a single yip. Instantly the murmurs were overwhelmed by hinks, quacks, caws, and screeches, the air force was in the air.
“EEEEEWWWW”’s filled the night as the skunks flanked the young humans, corralling them into a tight huddle. Bombs were dropped from the night sky, unhatched rotting eggs and seagull turds.
More distressed “EEEWWWs.” The huddle tried to disburse, tried to break fort heir cars. The skunks sprayed, opossums hissed, raccoons chattered, and a cougar roared. The young humans huddled tighty together once more.
The land assault was more in every way. Beaver tails flung mug, swamp muck, feces. The skunks turned into foundations of stink. Muskrats sat atop proud bucks whose rasks were strung with bras, flinging God only knows what into the crying screaming huddle.
One last aerial from gulls, finches, owls, hawks, pigeons, starlings, doves, even the eagle couple and their young from two lakes over added their excrement to the raining shower.
Lily nudged Red with her wing. Enough was enough, Red yipped, low and piercing. Obediently, all the animals of the lake, trees and grassland retreated back to their homes. There was much revelry and caterwauling as they faded into the night.
The earlier “Eeews” were now replaced with crying and whimpering, but the young humans would not budge from their huddle. Lilly Swan and Red Fox sat side by side feeling quite vindicated, yet oddly protective of the young humans. Thy watched and waited until the last car door slammed, until the last tail light blinked out in the night, before they walked and waddled, side by side, back to Lilly Swan’s nest."

Afterwards, you and your roommate are both given charge papers and got to a disciplinary hearing, where the Disciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO) reads the charges brought against you and where you get to plead your case for your innocence. This however, doesn’t matter.
Afterwards, you are formally charged and you lose certain privileges, such as the use of the phone, loss of visitations, and canteen restrictions. Losing canteen is not so bad. Losing visitation is pretty hard. No phone calls at all… Now that is just plain ridiculous!
They don’t realize how these things affect you mentally. Seeing or talking to your family gets you through the hard times in here and losing your privileges for four months because of something you didn’t do is mentally taxing.
I honestly wish that I could get an apology for the heartache and mental anguish I’ve gone through, that will never happen.
I wish I could get an apology for being labeled as a trouble maker because of someone else’s actions. It is infuriating at times.

Jimmy what? Move your hand,” she’s thinking. The mailman looks puzzled.
“Are you ok?”   “Uh… yes of course. Do you know if Jimmy Callahan still lives in 216?” Sara decides to play dumb.
The mailman smiles and looked at the envelope. “This says Jimmy Swanson.” Sara thanks him, turns, and walks away.
She finally pushes the crazy notion out of her head and hurries back to class in time for the test. As she sits at her desk, she hears, “Times up! Turn in your papers.” Her mind snaps back into reality, and she turns in a blank paper. Her mind must have been in Apartment 216. For the next several days, she leans against the outside wall of the young man’s apartment building, hoping to see him again. It’s like he disappeared.
Today, it is raining again. As Sara stands there under her umbrella, she is shocked once more. The young man is no more than 10 feet away and heading straight for her. Her heart feels as though it is going to leap out of her chest. He stops right in front of her and smiles. They stare one another up and down: definitely twins.
Sara knew without even asking. Tears filled her eyes. “They told me you were dead, but I could feel you.”
“They told me the same thing, but I knew better since I could feel you too,” the young man smiled.
“Oh Jimmy, Jimmy! I can’t believe it’s true!” Sara shouts out as she throws her arms around him. Suddenly, she feels hair. Hair? Yeah, lots and lots of hair. Her eyes open and her fuzzy cat Jake is cuddled in her arms. Sara cries.
For two days, Sara cries, not leaving her apartment. Here, here in 216, she can feel him. “God, let me know the truth! Where is my brother?” Finally, on the third day, Sara decides to og back to the apartments where she had followed the young man and to knock on Apartment 216. It’s raining again, and so Sara grabs her umbrella, opens it, and steps out into the pouring rain.
Immediately, her heart stops beating. Drenched to the bone, the young man is leaning on the outside wall of her apartment building without an umbrella. Sara pinches herself hard: ouch!
Smiles spread across their rain soaked faces as they stand there staring one another up and down.
“Are you Jimmy Callahan?” Sara asked.
“Yes, are you Sara Callahan?” Jimmy asked.
“Yes. Well, it’s Sara Perkins now. My foster parents adopted me and gave me their last name.”
“Yeah, mine too. It’s Jimmy Swanson now.”
“I’ve been going to your apartment building every day after the first time I saw you. You never came home while I was there.”
Sara explained, “That’s because I was standing here everyday waiting to see you again. I followed you all the way to your apartment the first time I ever saw you leave the college. Apartment 216, right?” Jimmy asked.
“I followed you to your apartment also. I felt like you were with me when I saw you enter your apartment, right?” Sarah smiled.
“Yeah, I felt the same way when I saw you go into yours.”
They stood and hugged in the pouring rain. “I imagine that. Twins separated for sixteen years, finding one another a mere 12 blocks apart.” The door closed behind them as they entered into apartment 216."

The bridge appears unbroken or otherwise unmarred. No jokes dare be made at the expense of your splendid nose. They couldn’t speak such blasphemy. Have goddesses offered to let you be one of their ladies-in-waiting? Are not sculptors beating down your door to have you model for them? Perhaps artists are calling you to pose for them? If only in profile? They should, dearie. Let page-after-page show the world of your luxurious appearance. Busts need to be done to exemplify such womanly poise.
Full lips are played out. Why don’t those in the fashion industry put you at their forefront? With your consent, we’ll start a revolution. Removing the precedents put in place by those who have lined the pockets of countless doctors is our goal. WOmen’s liberation from the knife and botox injections begins with you. What do you say? We’ll take the world by storm as we redirect the public’s ideals, sugar.
Then again, you may not be ready or willing to make the leap to stardom. Your lips are parted in surprise at this chance encounter. Were this image not frozen in time, I could discern if your lips are quivering in fear, or if it’s just my imagination running wild. I believe there’s an inner strength within you that would make Joan of Arc proud.
That hair of yours! Oh, how it exhibits such beautiful body. I wonder, is it natural, or did you spend hundreds of dollars in a salon to make it magnificent? Nope, not you. It’s a natural, and how the wind has caught it slightly gives you the pleasant effect of a halo that accentuates your ethereal beauty. I’ll say you brush it 200 times in the morning, then 300 at night before bed. Such splendid locks, sweetheart. YOu do an incredible job of maintaining them. Queens and female presidents have called on you for coffee so they may bask in the glory of your beauty, haven’t they? If not, they should have! When their subjects see you on their leader’s dais, they will swear their undying loyalty to them. You could be the catalyst that keeps them, and generations to follow, in power. Think on it, love.
When you look in the mirror, do you perchance see what I do? The whole package dazzles me. Your forehead slopes in an elegant fashion. High cheekbones further enchant me, as they remind me of those in positions of royalty and the commanding presence they bear. Looking at your cheeks, I see something else awesome about you. They curve in such a delectable fashion that I wonder if you are part mermaid? Viewing your jaws and chin causes me to question if you are related to supermodels who grace the runways with such style. Your neck brings it all together by accentuating the smoothness of your skin. It looks as soft as a cloud. Have angels come to you and ask that you roam the heavens with them to outshine the stars? If not, please tell me they’ve at least requested that you be present when they sing, so that their voices, combined with your beauty, would persuade Satan to change his ways.
Dear heart, we can change the world one photo--one work of art--at a time. With your arresting looks, I could show your face on battlefields then each side would stop fighting to see who was in their midst. Give me your consent and assistance so we can raise this destitute world toward its much needed cosmetic enlightenment."

She is puzzled and asks, “Why do you say fantastic when I just said the three pm flight is canceled?” I smile and say, there are only three reasons why anybody is going to cancel a flight. One, something is wrong with the plane; two, something is wrong with the pilot; three, something is wrong with the weather they are flying the airplane in. If any one of those three situations exists, I don’t want to be up there. I want to be down here. Fantastic!
To my response, the ticket agent says “The next flight doesn’t leave until 6 pm.” I reply Fantastic! The agent says, “why would you say fantastic when I just said you have a four hour wait in the Kansas City airport?” I reply.

I am here in one of the nicest buildings in the area. It is the biggest, comfortable, rent-free office I have at my disposal! Fantastic!
I can choose to respond-which is positive-or I can choose to react-which is negative I choose to respond.
At the airline counter, I have a choice. I can rant and rave. I can choose to react and the next flight still leaves at six pm.
You can watch a person go about their daily activities for days or weeks and learn a great deal about them. However, you can watch a person under adverse circumstances for five minutes and see whether they have learned to respond or to react. Actually, you can learn more about them in a few minutes under trying conditions than you can in days of just watching them involved in daily activities.
Your response-or reaction-to the negative reveals what’s inside of you. It exposes your heart and shows the kind of person you really are. The problem is that most people have a tendency to react instead of respond and blame everything and everybody for their difficulties in life."

On the way into town we stopped at my best friend Buddy Sutton’s house and picked him up also. We also stopped to pick up my friend Yancy and his sister Shanna. All the way into town the only thing anyone said to me was “Happy Birthday.” In the words of Alice in Through the Looking Glass this entire situation was getting curiouser and curiouser.
Finally, we pulled into the parking lot of the local Ken’s Pizza and saw the rest of my friends from school and church arriving. What a strange coincidence, I thought at the time--hey give me a break, I was only eleven years old.
Mom and dad had planned a birthday pizza party at the restaurant. Also invited was another neighbor Lara Coke, who would become my very first girlfriend. My oldest brother and two sisters who no longer lived at home also came. My sister Pam and her husband Doug drove all the way from their home in Irving Texas to be there too.
It was a great party and I believe that we all had a great time--I know that I did! There was pizza galore, games, and I got a lot of cool gifts too. The people who worked at the restaurant even sang “Happy Birthday” to me.
They say that all good things come to an end and eventually it was true, in the case of the party. As much as I would have been content to stay in that moment for a lot longer, ultimately my friends and their families had to leave. It had been a very enjoyable birthday, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed, not because of the pizza and presents, but because I had been able to share it with the people that I loved.
When I got home I went about doing the same things that I did every Saturday. I played and I did my chores, and come suppertime I had one more surprise waiting for me: Mom had not forgotten about the pecan pie! Now, this day went from being very memorable to being my most memorable birthday ever."

Survival becomes a necessity, and necessity becomes life’s purpose. As sensitive as it may be, it is reality.
Luckily and gracefully, I have survived all things, including prison. Which has brought a new purpose in life: to end the cycle.
I have a new life’s purpose. One that is in contrast to all the things, desires, and thoughts that shaped my definition of life and purpose for so much of my existence. One that has everything, to do with others and little to do with me. I mean wouldn’t life for everyone be more joyful, peaceful, and fulfilling. If our neighbors life’s purpose was to help with the next man?
God has blessed me with three sons! My purpose is to try to ensure that they don’t have to make their life’s purpose survival. I do not believe that prison denies a man or woman the ability to play an active, instructive and influential role in the lives of their children. No, it’s quite the opposite. Experience is one of the greatest tools in life. Accompanied with love, desire, will, initiative and prayer, it is possible to fulfill life’s purpose of making out children’s stay on this planet a better one than what we had.
For me, I find no cause more honorable than to be a father who contributes to the wellness of the lives of my children. Prison walls may physically separate me from my sons but a purposeful life must tear down barriers, break stereotypes and let love guide its steps toward a better day.
Yes, there will be trial and tribulation all the peaks and valleys. But what in life comes easily this is truly purposeful? I am not surprised at all that behind prison walls I realized the most nobel purpose for me: FATHERHOOD"

Benji stared at her, his mouth open. The partially chewed ravioli he’d been savoring plopped on his plate, falling from his mouth.
“Hi,” he replied.
LIke a skilled dentist, Amy eased words painlessly, from Benji’s mouth, innocently asking him about his needles. Benji then told her everything.
“Oh my,” Amy said, “I wonder what might happen if you got really… happy.”
“No one ever asked me that,” Benji, mouth agape, observed.
That night, when Benji went to bed, he noticed many of the needles that had been with him for months, some for years, had fallen away!
As months passed, Benji’s needles fell away, until by the end of the year, he had no more silvers of steel poking from him. Often, he walked Amy home, talking with her along the away, with a resistant needle here and there, occasionally dropping free. However, Amy never let Benji walk her up to her house’s door. Sometimes, when they are close to Amy’s house, Benji heard shouting, things being thrown and crashing in the house. Sometimes, Benji saw bruises on Amy or a faintly black eye. Sometimes, Amy missed school.
There was a dance at the end of the year. Benji wanted to ask Amy to go to the dance, but she hadn’t been coming to school for over a week. Although he knew Amy didn’t want him to do so, Benji decided to go to Amy’s house and ask if she was okay.
That’s what he did after school.
Benji observed that Amy’s house was not much more than a shack. Its siding weathered red asphalt shingles. The lights were not on.
Benji knocked. No one answered.
He knocked again, louder, then louder still.
After what must have been over twenty knocks, the door opened. A swollen, unshaven man’s face loomed over Benji, who was nauseated at the stench of spilled beer and old sweat that poured from the doorway. “How,” Benji wondered, “could Amy smell so good and live in this house?”
“Um, excuse me, sir,” Benji mumbled, “I’m a friend of Amy’s and was wondering why she hasn’t been in school for a while.”
“How should I know,” the man said, scratching his beard, looking down at Benji suspiciously, “she hasn’t come out of her room for days.”
“She hasn’t?” Benji said, concerned. A glistening steel needle slowly sprouted from his scalp.
“You’re, you’re that boy,” the man said, nervously.
“Yes,” Benji said, “sir, may I please see Amy?”
He didn’t wait for an answer, stepped past the man and into the house, a house far different from his own.
“Fine,” the man said, “Her room’s upstairs, first door on the left.”
Benji went to Amy’s door. The stench coming from inside was different.
The doctor, ten years later, had given up asking Benji what happened at Amy’s house. Benji couldn’t remember and the needles that shot out from his skin, though slender, had a pesky habit of piercing wood, glass, even steel, and the doctor’s tissues.
Benji never found out what would happen if he became really happy. He didn’t want to remember what happened when he became really sad, really angry."

Once, he thought, I could have given you the world. Now I fail your most simple request.
“You know there’s none.”
“Water,” Marcello sighed.
He was useless to his son, a dried-up husk.
“Stop,” he ordered, “Talk.” He must talk. The traffickers must hear him talk.
Hands waved. “Water,” they insisted.
Georgio seized the boy’s hands and smacked them, too weak to cause pain. Yet, Marcello stumbled away, eyes wide. He had never struck him before. He reached for his son, arms plended. Marcello stepped back.
Son, Giorgio thought, how can I make you understand that if you do not talk, you will die?
Marcello’s hands fumbled, desperate to speak, then fell sadly to his sides.
My poor, obedient boy, Georgio groaned.
The guards stared. Without words, the boy was of no use to them. He had overheard their discussion in the morning. They would leave those of no value behind to die so the others might survive. Without water, no one would live long.
If only he could explain. But his son must never know. Today is probably his last day and he should be happy.
But I have ruined even that, he thought.
Marcello waited, shoulders slumped, jace defeated.
“Go play, Marcello,” Georgio whispered. The shadow hesitated, then disappeared. The sun beat down again and he discovered he could still cry. Even without water for tears.
Dusk approached, the shadow longer but the town still an over.
“Marcello,” Georgio rasped. Silence. His absence tugged at him. He rolled to his knees, searching. His son must not be alone. Not tonight. He pulled himself to his feet with a cry. He had strength left.
“One more night. Then we will die together,” he promised. The guards sat too weak to care as he staggered into the ruins.
He stumbled through the maze of decomposing houses beneath the full moon, the atmosphere gradually cooling. As his energy faded, he crawled.
Then, a cry.
“Marcello!” he called, frantically pulling himself forward. A cry below him. Confusion. Then, a splash. Lunging ahead, he heaved himself onto the walls of a well. He peered down, moist air rising. A cry from the bottom. With the pulley, rope, and rediscovered strength, he pulled and pulled until a dripping head emerged. Then dark eyes staring into his. The boy climbed out, water splashing off him into newborn puddles.
Then, Georgio stood tall. His hands moved.
“Water,” he said apologetically. Marcello stepped forward and took Georgia’s hands in his own, pressing gently. He turned and drew a red bucket from the well. He tilted it to his father’s lips until water cascaded down, glistening silver in the moonlight.
Later, refreshed, they chased and drenched one another with buckets of water from the endless source. Laughter echoed off the crumbling houses until father and son collapsed together, dripping and shivering beneath the stars.
In the morning, the traffickers were gone. With water, the men left behind revived and grew like seeds. Georgio watched the sun rise, this time burning death away. He felt a touch on his arm.
“Papa,” a voice whispered. Georgio pulled Marcello close, not needing another word, grateful for the tears he could finally cry."

The shoreline was then undeveloped, but it was carefully built up with massive rocks and leveled off with beautiful sand.
We set up camp there with the van, the unhitched station wagon, a campfire, and our styrofoam cooler stocked with hot dogs, mayo, mustard, ketchup, and bologna floating in melting ice. We lived there for months. Jose and Lori moved on. My dad was always gone during the day, welding at the shipyard.
I passed my days climbing among the big rocks and the large crevices between them at low tide. I explored the starfish, sea urchins, mussels, crabs, and other scurrying creatures. I learned how to fish and cast a line off a soda can. Within walking distance was the Pike, an old amusement park, and there were nearby streets lined with tattoo parlors; from where my mom came home late with her colorful butterflies, and my dad with the pink panther on his upper arm with JANICE inked underneath it.
Eventually, we moved into a house, which we shared with another couple and their son who was older than me. I remember chasing my beloved skateboard into the four lanes of busy traffic there; nearly getting ran over, and then picking up the two halves and carrying them home. My dad repaired it. Also, I remember fighting with the boy who lived there. Then one day my dad had a brainstorm, which led us on our next road trip, back to rural New York. Keeping a styrofoam cooler from squeaking in the back of a station wagon for 3,000 miles is harder than you may think. And the road trips continued…"

The way that I’ve chosen is a different way. It isn’t conformity, it isn’t following the norm, and it isn’t the easiest way. The way that I’ve chosen is a way that betters me mentally, a way that will change me on the inside. It’s a way that will make me a better person, a better father, son, and husband. It’s a way that will strengthen my mind and spirit.
Following the path that I’ve chosen isn’t the easiest way, not in a world where the strong prey on the weak. A world where prison rules have been in place for decades to protect the hard-core prisoner’s way of life.
As I travel down the tracks laid before me, I spend my time reading and writing. I’m not the best at either, but I learn something new each day in hopes that one day I’ll be great at them. I write my story, sharing with those who’ll listen to what life is like for me, a prisoner who doesn’t want to be.
The tracks are laid out before me, the distance shrouded in mist. I don’t know where they go, only that they do and I must follow them. My only comfort is knowing that I still have some control of how I travel down them, the tracks I call the Prison Railway."

Third, I am enrolled and currently studying for my Bachelors Degree in Christian Counseling from the International Christian College & Seminary.

For those of you who are in prison, take every opportunity to educate yourself. If you haven’t received your GED, work hard to get it. Take all the college, A.C.E courses you can possibly take and prepare yourself for the street. In addition, try to maintain employment while in prison. In my almost twenty years of prison time, I have maintained constant employment no matter what department it was with. This will allow you to stay busy and keep out of trouble to the best of your ability.
For those of you on the street, no matter what life deals you, keep on pushing through. If you lose your job, beat the streets and find another one. Go back to school and change your career if you have to find a new job. Above all, never give up.

Upon arrival at my ex-wife’s home, my daughter answers the door. As she opens the door, my ex, “Hitler”, is screaming, “Where have you been?” And now my daughter is bawling in tears as she spreads her arms with her cutest summer dress and sandals to give her dad a hug. I say to her, “Sweetheart, what’s wrong?” She says she thought I got hurt and wasn’t coming or something. I quickly explained to her simply that I had to work late. But as I pulled into the driveway of her mom’s house, I noticed a bucket, and being as though it was so late, it didn’t cross my mind that my daughter had prepared to help me wash my work truck as we often did before our weekend outings.
After addressing Hitler, my daughter and I headed out and I told the ex I’d have Lisa back Sunday afternoon as usual. My daughter, still sniffling with tears in her eyes, followed my lead out of the door towards my truck. She said, “Daddy, would you still like to wash your truck?” I said, “No, sweetheart, it’s a bit late.” Well, to my surprise she began crying again and so I quickly changed my tune, got the hose from the side of the house, and wet down my truck. My daughter soon used the bucket of soapy water she had anticipated using to wash my truck earlier and began sponging down the truck’s body. Then all of a sudden, splash! My daughter sneaks around the tailgate of the truck and douses me with the soapy sponge. I then spray her a bit and chase her with the hose. I turn my headlights on because she tries to hide in front of the truck away from the hose’s spray. I circle to cut her off at the hood and splash! She soaks me with the suds and water as she is now laughing her rear off as she says, “I got ya daddy!” At this point, I rush her and pick her up to hug her. We both are now crying laughing and now there’s not a dry eye or anything else dry as we cheerily complete the task of our bonding ritual before we go to a cruise, followed by Pizza Hut, a late movie, and a few video games before my daughter decides it’s night night. That little ten year old, now an adult, is still my pride and joy. And often when I sit back and reminisce on the time we shared and quirky moments that bonded us closely, I begin to tear up and once again there’s not a dry eye."
1784,"""An Attitude of Gratitude"" by William Hill ",,No,2017.0,04 - April,Word Theme Essay,https://www.notion.so/Gratitude-3d58a5cb162f470cb450edf4932f5bc2,Katie Kwak,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aAc1TL8ieI6d1z0kZ_tcxJcybUvKihpeXPbe39pkMw4/edit,No,"One summer I was out in a hayfield baling hay, trying to rake them into windrows before it rained. I didn’t quite make it. Suddenly the sky turned black and the clouds let loose with what the old folks used to call a “frog drowner.” Early on, dad instilled in me the necessity of getting away from a tractor during a lightning storm, and on this day the sky was lit with so many flashes of lightning, it looked like a Pink Floyd concert. I turned the tractor’s ignition off and began walking home in the torrential rainstorm. Fortunately, the walk was only about a half mile from the house but it was raining so hard I was completely drenched by the time I reached shelter. Every other step I wiped raindrops off my face. I was wearing a replica football jersey with red shoulder patches and a red “10” on the front and back. Apparently the dyes used on this shirt were not so great because in the rain the colors began to run.
Mom was at the house making lunch when she happened to look out the window and saw me, her baby boy, walking up the road with what she thought to be blood running down my arms and smeared all over my face. In today’s parlance she “freaked.” I mean she went absolutely bonkers. She ran out of the house while I was still at least a hundred yards away and grabbed me, trying to find where the blood was coming from. She kept yelling, “Where are you hurt? Where are you hurt?” I told her, “I’m not hurt; I’m soaked.” Again, she never said the actual words “I love you” but by her actions she shouted them loudly.
I am also grateful for all the teachers that I have had in my life who not only tried to teach academics but instilled confidence in me as well. I am especially grateful for two teachers in particular: Mr. Jones who taught eighth grade science and made learning fun, and Mrs. Williams who made me keep a journal in freshman year English, igniting within me a desire to write that still burns today. Both of these teachers did more than just provide me with information---they taught me how to think for myself and how to question said information. I will never forget Mr. Jones and his passion for all things science and Mrs. Williams who saw something in me and continually encouraged me to dream bigger and expect more of myself than I thought was actually capable. Both of these teachers took the time to invest in me a part of them.
As important as they were in my life, I am even more grateful for the impact that others made. People such as Mr. and Mrs. Grimes, Mr. and Mrs. Sutton, Mr. and Mrs. Hurley, and Mr. and Mrs. Cook, all of whom took the time and effort to make sure that I was able to get to Sunday school and other church services. These men and women taught Sunday school classes, conducted Vocational Bible School during the summers and led youth group outings to invest into my life things of eternal value, not just temporal value.
Even in prison I have people who I am grateful for, like those who we call in here “Old Schools” because they are a little older or because they have been in here long enough to know the ins and outs of prison. Just one quick example of this was when I first came into the system and wanted to get a tattoo. Not just any tattoo, mind you, but a tattoo of the word “LIFE” across my forehead. Fortunately, I told one of the Old Schools in my pod about my plan and he did exactly what an Old School is supposed to do: put a Youngster in his place. He told me not to act like an idiot even if I was an idiot. He asked me: if I was still free and living amongst society would I still want to get that same tattoo? I had to admit I would not. He then asked me: if I wouldn’t want to get that tattoo out in the so-called free world, why would I want to get it in here? He made a lot of sense and I am grateful not only for his wisdom but also for his willingness to share what he had learned over many decades in prison. This is only one example of an inmate who invested in me.
These are only a few of the many people who have helped to shape and influence my life. I can never fully repay them for all that they have done but I can try to pass on what they have started. I may never have children to raise or be a teacher responsible for molding young minds, but I can be an Old School (albeit an extremely youthful looking one), to other Youngsters who are coming into the system not knowing what they are getting into. I am grateful that I am still able to do that, even after all of my youthful foolishness."

What a crazy accident … at least that was the news. That news story didn’t last long though, and neither would our innocence, as I watched on live-TV another crash - and now both of you were injured in the same way. As I saw the flames of the second crash my mind realized in a flash - this is no accident. Horror. Fear. Terror.
I was naive, for sure, at that moment, as I comforted myself with the notion that you two could still be rescued and restored to your twin majestic glory after some “healing” and “recuperation”. Then one of you fell down, and then I knew things would never be the same. Then, as if in sadness over the first loss, the other fell. Sisters to the end, now immortal in memories, in classic movie scenes, and in our hearts; Sisters. Towers. Innocence. All lost. Eighteen years ago - 9/11/01."

Immediately, my mind goes to one that I had recently, and his story is lost. A key word stimulates my attention back to him, only briefly, and I want to respond- I HAVE TO RESPOND before this moment of clarity is gone. I interrupt, or spill an anecdote that has nothing to do with what he needs to hear. A few rounds of this Morse code chatter, and I am lost again. Awkward silence. The island awaits. Luckily the man signs before I rudely walk away.
This is the side of ADD that people never hear. Most of us think about how we deal with it. It is the standard fare of continuous inner dialogue combined with adapting to island life. ""What am I going to do?"" ""How do I live like this?"" Sometimes, a hand will reach out to pull me in, but most often, in adults who were never properly diagnosed, those hands cannot even reach the world created across such a vast sea.
When self-pity becomes monotonous, I put myself into the place of my sister…my brothers…my daughter. I wonder how they would describe me (brilliant…unique…thoughtful), but I also wonder if they would. I wonder how my sister could have benefitted from really having a big brother, or how my daughter would have loved having a dad instead of the default father that I had backed away into being. The excuse of drug usage and alcoholism as aa escape handily created the self-diagnosis of simply being burned out, forgetful, and absent physically as the result of addiction.
Now, twelve years removed from that stereotype, I talk to people that I hardly even know who call me things like ""father"" and ""brother."" I wish they would include words like ""friend, ""a futile attempt at medication-free redemption, but a phone call can be made from even the most remote island, nowadays. I go home in four months. I wonder where I will hide, but mostly I obsess about being exposed as the fraudulent conceiver of awards, accomplishments, and certificates that ADD minds believe they never even earned. I simply worry that their reflection in my eyes will be frightening to behold when I never bothered to look on all of the times that it mattered.
Experts say that life upon release can become a clean slate. The fear of erasure at age 52 is nothing compared to the anxiety of beginning again with different Jenga pieces. When I run from the conversations in prison, I can justify them as being trivial or something that I don’t really need to hear, but the conversations with my family will be defining. They will include themes like redemption, or trust, they will probably even include words like ""I love you"" or ""I missed you."" How do I turn away from them again when there is that uneasy silence of my wandering mind? How do I interject when my daughter is spilling the reality resulting from my 26 years of absence? How do I expose myself, or them, to the selfishness… to the choice of having spent my entire life avoiding everyone…everything…even them?
I used to think that ADD was an excuse for kids growing up in the millennial world of pseudo-relationships. Now I wonder if having a label to the reason why I run is an excuse for being me. And really, I'm just someone that I created when I learned to thrive in the isolation of distraction.
1…4…3…5…2. Just when I think that I can still get there on this long, sidetracked way home, someone says ""I love you"" again.
And I'm distracted…again, trying to figure out who they really love."

I knew I had hit it. From that distance I barely heard the wolf’s yelp, but I watched it bolt into the thick woods trailing a thick line of blood.
There was no rush to follow. Pa had been teaching me how to track animals since I was in diapers. Besides, I knew this one was injured, and running straight for the river. It had nowhere to go.
Picking up the trail was easy, I followed it for about half an hour. The blood trail thinned and the tracks became larger. Previous experience told me that meant the animal was nearly out of blood and dragging its paws. I heard the laughter and the gurgling of the river as I came up to the slope that would lead down to rocky, snow-melt engorged river. From the crest of the rise, I expected to see the limp carcass of the wolf. Bleeding animals tend to find themselves moving toward water. Pa says it’s because of an insatiable thirst from blood loss.
Instead of the dead wolf, I found Pa. He was naked except for the hair that the good Lord had covered him in and splashed with blood. I moved faster towards him as I watched him dig around at his left hip. He was hurt. Then without a sound he pulled a nearly perfect bullet from the wound and looked up at me without surprise. He picked up his shirt from the pile of his clothes and wiped off the blood from over the wound that was no longer there.
That was how I found out that we weren’t like other folks and why we lived out off the grid in a modern age."

Size: tall or short, thin or heavy
Looks: no matter the different shapes or contours from deformities or medical reasons
Speech: from unable to talk, other language, to speak defects

God looks beyond all of these to see who you may be from inside your heart! It’s God’s desire that we all love one another. In (Romans 13:9-10) it says, “love your neighbor as yourself,” (vs 10) says, “love does no wrong to a neighbor.”
In (Isaiah 11:6-7) God makes mention of the peaceful existence we should portray, by using animals; (vs 6) wolf live with the lamb, leopard shall lie down with a goat (kid), a calf and lion, (vs 7) a cow and bear shall graze together.
In (Isaiah 65:25) a wolf and lamb feed together, a lion shall eat like the Bull (Bullock). God does not condone the mistreatment of one of his own created beings, whether they be human or animal beings!
In the beginning, God’s creation was the peaceful coexistence of “All” his beings he created, they were in perfect harmony, peacefulness, love, and no fear! This is why Eve in (Genesis 3:1-5) was able to talk to a (asp) or snake. Eve did not sense any harm or danger to be with or around a snake, Satan knew this, so he disguised himself as a serpent to deceive her.
It was from this point Satan was able to affect the order God had created by using our “free choice” on whether or not to believe the lies and deception of Satan!
My friends, remember this, “greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4). We can have God’s intended peace and love for one another, it is within each one of us to do so!!
“Love thy neighbor” (Matt 5:43) no matter who they may be!"

Since time began for the human species, men express hidden desires by giving flowers. Women express love with flowers to their mates as well. Even primates have been seen participating in such rituals.
Equally important- a gift of flowers to express remorse to the receiver, for slights, or cross words done in the heat of passion, or to express contrition for forgetting important rituals such as anniversaries, birthdays, and the like.
The home of many humans, have at least some flowers planted around it or within it. For it brings life to an inanimate structure- making a house a home, or any dwelling small or large.
Our parks and public spaces have become museums of flora and fauna. Great pride goes into heritage parks, memorials, public spaces. This system of public display of horticulture prowess is centuries old.
Flowers are very much a major part of life on our planet. We are often too busy to see just how much our lives are affected by the presence or absence of flowers. So next time you are out of the grey lifeless concrete of your prisons, look around and smell the flowers. Appreciate God’s glorious painting of our planet. Without flowers, blooms, life would not exist. So pay careful attention to these pollinators who spread the nectar of life from bloom to bloom worldwide. Protect the bees and butterflies, as well as the flowers of our world. Just look at how sad, dreary a prison is- it’s because there are no gardens, no flowers, no signs of life’s simple joys. Now imagine a world that was colorless, lifeless, as a prison’s concrete landscape. Stand up for life- plant a garden first chance you get- sponsor a beehive so our pollinators thrive. Be part of a healthy, beautiful humanity. Let your green thumb show through.
Next time you’re outdoors, take the time to appreciate the gallery of colors God has made!"

Crazy Frank really was insane. He would say things like, “Even an ant brushes his teeth, Boy!” and if you rode your bicycle by his house he would run up to you holding a shovel and tell you “You’d better take this with you, because you’re going to be running over a lot of animals!” He also paid me a dollar a week to get his mail out of his mailbox and put it on his porch because there was a witch that lived in a potato his ex-wife had throw at the mailbox. He said he could see the witch flying around the mailbox all the time but that she wouldn’t bother me because I was too short for her to get at me yet. Anyway, he said we should take the dog to the vet and have it checked for chlamydia. I didn’t know what the word meant but my parents sure did. My dad clapped his hands around my ears and asked Frank “Why in the world would you think that dog has chlamydia, Frank?” and Frank said “I don’t know, I just heard it was going around.” Needless to say, we didn’t take Lemon to the vet to have him checked for chlamydia and just went on enduring the farts as best we could.
One day I was leaving the backyard and tricky Lemon squeezed between me and the gate and took off like lightning to the river, and I tore off behind him yelling “Lemon’s out! Help!” I could hear my parents run out of the house behind me and the chase was on. I rounded the corner of a building and saw Lemon making a beeline straight to this little kid fishing on the bank of the river. I had just enough time to yell “NO!” right as Lemon leapt on the kid and both of them went over the bank and into the river. I ran up to the edge of the riverbank and saw that they were both okay but Lemon was dog paddling and pushing the kid’s head underwater. I could also see all the fart bubbles popping up around Lemon and the kid so that every time the child came up for breath he was breathing in dog fart. I saw him coughing and was about to jump in the river myself when they both came upon a sandbar in the middle of the river. Lemon started licking the kid’s face like he wasn’t wet enough already and the kid was pushing Lemon away and saying “Somebody please come get this smelly dog away from me.” I swam out and got Lemon and said I was sorry and if he was okay. He said that Lemon tried to murder him and he was going to tell his dad. All three of us got to shore and we went off home soaking wet and minus a fishing rod and I took Lemon home and told my parents what happened We didn’t hear anything more about the incident until about a month later till the kid’s father showed up at the door with a doctor’s bill for his son from the encounter with Lemon. There was an itemized list of charges like X-rays ($25), antiseptic ($5), and bandages ($2). My dad set the bill on the table and went into the kitchen to talk to the kid’s father. So I snuck over to the table and looked at the bill. And at the bottom there was a charge that had been scratched out but you could still barely make it out and it said ($15) chlamydia shot.
So maybe it was going around."

Before it happened, Red Dot sped up then he started spraying across the Macs. Cut Mike and the girl down, running, firing, popped the clip, turned it over. Cain started tearing everything up. Shit got to get a K. Everyone is falling, spraying. Bodies falling, everything is laying down. Red Dot grabbed the last two clips, ran over to Mike, sprayed his whole body, ran, grabbed a piece of chicken off the grill. Cain and Red Dot ran through the backgate. Demon was right here. Let’s go, take me across town. Don’t speed, Cain said. That was a real family reunion. THey all were visiting their past loved ones. That was for Money Clip. This was a nice job. Call me again, Demon. Red Dot took off one of his shirts, wrapped his guns in it, and walked off. Cain was taken to his house. Demon drove off. Can’t believe it. Nice day for a family reunion -- ha."

After securing permission, and being told to work with the Chaplain, I started soliciting money from his circle of close friends, then from anyone, for a donation for a headstone. Through my effort I raised $376. The Chaplain told me that after 32 years in DOC, this was a first that he knew of.
It was through my association with John that I had changed my attitude. You may be asking, “What does this have to do with ‘My Body’?” Bear with me, here’s my story.
I just turned 72 and having spent some 50 years in some sort of institution, the last 37.8 here. At first I was angry and blamed everyone for me not being free. After I turned 70, I have been thinking, “Is there anything positive that I can do to make up for all the lost years of my life”? Recently I discovered YES there is, I can donate my body to science. I do not want the burden of $3000-$4000 on my family, and it would be a waste, like the last 50 years, for the state to bury me.This decision displays a noble and unselfish concern for the welfare of others. This is my way of giving back. I believe that everyone wants their life to mean something this is my way.
This is my plea to anyone reading this, especially prisoners who are selfish, donate your body to science, it will help so many people."

Things clear up and we resume our snail's pace. As we go through the mountain, I see some fun anomalies like overturned snowplows and as we make one steep ascent the car trying to pass us spins out and beings to descend. I keep on trekking northbound.
Despite the low speeds, these snow crews are not used to a foot and a half or more of snow and most of the plows wind up either in a ditch or overturned; ergo a great level of concentration is requisite to staying on the road (or what is to pass for a road at this point.)
When we finally hit the Maryland static line, it is dark already, but I have never been so happy to get out of a state as I am to leave Virginia.
And of course, the 30 or so miles of Maryland are somehow worse! By this point, the wife is getting nervous about my being behind the wheel for over a day straight, the kids are getting restless, and I am still perfectly content to pee in a bottle for the next 10-12 hours, though perhaps the mental acuity to transpose philosophy into mathematics is somewhat mushy.
We settle on this. We will make it through Maryland and then see how Pennsylvania roads look before deciding whether or not to call it a night.
At 1 am and 6 miles into Pennsylvania, I finally make the call to get a hotel room. The roads are slightly better, but I am toasted and ready to call it.
We get a cheap room and pass out. By 3 am, I eventually wake the wife, carry the sleeping boys to the car and we drive the final 6 hours on clear roads. The boys and wife wake up around the time I pull into her parents' driveway and her father has prepared a killer breakfast. We attack the day with the most memorable part of the vacation behind us."

Upon arrival at my ex-wife’s home, my daughter answers the door. As she opens the door, my ex is screaming, “Where have you been?!” And now my daughter is bawling in tears as she spreads her arms with her cute summer dress and sandals to give her dad a hug.
I say to her, “Sweetheart, what is wrong?” she says she thought I got hurt and wasn’t coming, or something. I quickly explained to her that I had to work late. But as I pulled into the driveway of her mom’s house, I noticed a bucket and being as though it was so late it didn’t cross my mind that my daughter had prepared to help me wash my work truck as we often did before our weekend outings.
After addressing my wife, my daughter and I headed out and I told the ex I’d have Lisa back Sunday afternoon as usual. My daughter, still sniffling with tears in her eyes, followed my lead out of the door towards my truck.
She said, “Daddy, would you still like to wash your truck?”
I said, “No, sweetheart, it’s a bit late.”
Well, to my surprise she began crying again, and so I quickly changed my tune. I got the hose from the side of the house and wet down my truck. My daughter soon used the bucket of soapy water she had anticipated using to wash my truck earlier and began sponging down the truck’s body. Then all of a sudden, splash! My daughter sneaks around the tailgate of the truck and dowses me with the soapy sponge. I then sprayed her a bit and chased her with the hose. I turned my headlights on because she tried to hide in front of the truck away from the hose’s spray. I circle to cuther off at the hood and splash! She soaks me with the suds and water, as she is now laughing her rear off as she says,
“I got ya daddy!” At this point, I rush to her and pick her up to hug her. We both are now crying, laughing. Now there’s not a dry eye or anything else dry as we cheerily complete the task of our bonding ritual before we go for a cruise followed by Pizza Hut, a late movie, and a few video games before my daughter decides it’s night night. That little ten year old, now an adult, is still my pride and joy. And often when I sit back and reminisce on the time we shared and quirky moments that bonded us closely, I begin to tear up and once again, there’s not a dry eye."

It didn’t run out. Now…”
Well, f-! I thought, that explains a lot… S-, I’m screwed again, Maldito sea!
“Now talk Georgie. Talk fast.” There’s not much you can do when you’re not just outnumbered but hopelessly outgunned: as in, still recuperating - more than that -, suffering something like shock or dislocation or whatever. To top it all off, you’re at a gunfight and didn’t even bring a feather. Tension was rising, crackling, sizzling the very air. I had no real choice. I said, “ I want to be claro, like crystal, ¿sabes? I haven’t been-”
“Greed. Thank you for helping our Georgie Boy,” said Rafa. At his back peace were a lot more than nine chicanos. Nobody's face matched Rafa’s words, they matched his tone.
“It’s the least we could do after what Joey did. Let’s call it a peace offering, huh?” Greed’s eyes never left mine. It’s amazing how what we say sometimes has nothing to do with what we mean.
“Is this a peace offering” asked Julia, violence naked in his eyes. People shifted. Movements accompanied by a low, increasing rumble of hearts pumping adrenaline. A bloody storm was close to bursting. What the f-? I stood, expecting that to be the spark. It wasn't. I took a step forward, certainly now. Nope. Another step, steps, nada. Julio’s eyes never left Greed’s. Everyone else either stared at me leaving or between the two lions. Back among my gente, I still couldn’t believe it was over.
Once upon a time, America had thought prison wasn’t enough. Not safe for the guards, staff, the public - no one really gave a s- about us. So, they had built a multi-billion dollar concrete, god damn cage. Luckless State Prison Lucky Hole. That had been America’s answer, over 300 acres of steel, concrete and lethality. Lock away the problems and that will cure the country. But it hadn’t, had it? Victor continued musing about Lucky Hole, life and nature’s beauty. Yes, it was beautiful to be free, even if you were stranded on an island. Before him spread other islets and a vast body of water. Behind him, there was Lucky Hole. There could be no going back.
“Lucky Hole Chronics: Chapter 15” by E.C. Theus-Roberts
“Yo, my brothas, it’s that time,” said Abdul. Each man with him had only one purpose. None expected to cross No Man’s Land again.
Surreal doesn’t even begin to cover it. I’d gone from the hellside of purgatory to hell proper to something completely not hell at all. ¿De veras se suceidó esto? I guess it really did happen because we were already past the library, our zone within sight. As happy as I was, I couldn’t breathe, too many people, too many changes. I stopped. Julio and Rafa stopped also then, so did Manuel and eventually everybody else. For the third time in the last two hours, I was the center of attention. One step back turned into two, two into five then, I bolted. I ran back to my only refuge.
“Fuck you!” rasped Deón from inches away, his knife sinking down some seven inches into his third victim’s neck, piercing lung and arteries. Deón had become a madman as only grief and vengeance can create. He moved off to find a fourth when the fourth found him. Eli had always been a scrapper. Whether bare fist brawling or playing with shiny toys, he was it. Deón had no clue what hit him, neither did Eli.
“¡Qué va!” exclaimed Manuel, “What the hell? ¿Qué le anda mal con ese huey?”
“Manny, ven conmigo y Rafa,” said tired Julio, “we’ll get Georgie and you fools. We’ll meet back home.” Rafa had already wheeled off. Julio and Manuel watched the others leave. Without looking at him Manuel said, “We should let ‘em go…”
“Ya lo sé,” replied Julio walking in the other direction. Manuel took his time catching up.
The seascape was beautiful. A soft breeze caressed his face carrying fresh coolness. The dock was well-worn. Hundreds, thousands of times boots, high-heels, sneakers and even sandals had pounded its planks. Peaceful is what would have come to mind and Victor not been stranded. From the islet, he could see the mainland standing on the pier. Walking around its several couple hundred square footage, he could also see Hell. No wonder Lucky Hole was really escape proof: it was the only thing for miles in an oceanic desert. The train led back to hell. Not even an option. Victor cried for the first time since his father had died. “¡Qué dulce amargura!” was all he mustered.
“No, no puedo más,” I pleaded to no one, “I just can’t.” It’d been too motherf-ing much. I doubt they had ever understand. When they found me, I was huddled in the very back of the library. I was fetal position, rocking back and forth, whimpering. One positive thought, I wasn’t crying. For whatever that’s worth.
Nobody moved, let alone said a word since old Georgie Boy and company had left. From the looks on these nine faces, everyone was thinking the same thought: now what?
Swimming wasn’t much of an option either. There weren’t many resources on the island other than a few trees, benches, vending machines, and a prefabricated indoor restroom. Victor thought about it again. I could swim; I mean it doesn’t look that far. I could do it. Lo puedo pero, ¿hay tiburones? Sharks or no sharks, stay or swim. Victor wouldn’t go back to Lucky Hole and couldn’t live on Coca-Cola and paydays forever.
“What else?” ordered Tonka. He looked about ready to split wood barefisted. Midget knew he didn’t want the “Murphy Treatment.” screwing up what tiny balls he had, he said, “I said it all a zillion f-ing times! I-”
“Well, say it again,” only Greed’s hand laid on Tonka’s shoulder stopped what would have been an onslaught of biblical proportions. Midget launched into it again. Old Gerogie Boy had been nodding out in the library, reading a history book or something. He’d thought he’d solved the unsolvable: how to escape Lucky Hole forever. Then, he had woken up to Murphy and his five friends. He had told Murphy that he had been reading that book when he had figured it all out. Midget’s tale was done. Silence and nervous glances. Tonka was barely contained. Greed, head angled as if in prayer. Tonka awaited the signal, any signal.
“Alrighty then,” said Greed, “we go to the library.”"

Studying different religions and faiths. Going through history books learning all about our “ancestors” and the ones who lived, built, and died for this country. I’m sure our “ancestors” are rolling around in their grave when they look down on us and see they shed blood for no reason. Not just their own blood, but the blood of so many.
We want it all. Why, because our “jealousy,” because we covet what others have. We want to be the best, have the best, or look the best. Where does this all stem from? Where do we get this mindset that leads us to a life of evil against others? Prideful, egotistic beasts and monsters.
How do we heal this growing disease? What helped me is taking responsibility for my own actions. Don't blame mom or pops; don’t blame God or the devil; don’t blame cops or the judge; friends or enemies. You did this, whatever has got you on a downward path to destruction is your own choice. Nobody is forcing you or forced you to shoot, rob, rape, etc.
The cops, judge, devil, they did not make you do it. So they gave you too much time, boo-hoo! Stop crying about it and go get in the law books. Educate yourself. I was eighteen years old when I caught my charge and now I’m thirty-one.
My public defender tricked me into accepting an open plea to second degree murder. He told me that if I accepted the plea I wouldn’t get any more than twelve years in prison. Well, I’ve been incarcerated for thirteen years now. I wasted a lot of years blaming others.
I am guilty of no more than manslaughter, which carries a maximum of fifteen years in prison here in Florida. I can’t change my situation by complaining and taking it out on others. What is sad is most of you will get out and continue to break the law because it’s okay for you to do it, but nobody else is allowed.
Think about your thoughts and change your thought patterns. You're not the only one going through shit. Look at this idea: we all have done so much (you, me, our accusers), and it’s not a new thing under the sun, someone else has done it, is doing it, and will do it.
Don’t blame where you’ve been, or what you've been through, stop blaming your messed up childhood, other people have, are, and will walk that exact same path. The only thing that truly matters now, right here, today, this very moment, is what are you willing to do, and what are you going to do in the future.
Stop feeling bad for yourself, you’re not a baby who needs your diaper changed or a bottle, so nobody is going to come running. They say the quickest way to the top is to get off your bottom. Don’t take it out on others, I can tell you from experience it will only dig a deeper hole.
Do the right thing. Make the right choices. Break that cycle around you and claim success in your life. You don’t need to believe in anything or anyone else, just believe in yourself and all things will be possible.
You are only poor to a richer person, but you are richer than a poorer person. You are ugly, fat, skinny, etc. only to someone who is opposite to you. I guarantee that a lot of people think you are so ugly, but I can guarantee there are just as many people who think you’re handsome, beautiful, sexy, etc.
You are fatter than a lot, but skinnier than many. If you are one of those people who is called ugly, ugly first of all is in the heart and mind of the holder. Who gets to pick who’s ugly, skinny, fat, etc. Does Hollywood get to make that choice for the entire world? Yes, only because we let them.
If someone calls you stupid think of something you’re really good at and challenge that person’s knowledge to what you know. If someone calls you ugly, agree with them because we are all uglier than somebody, but we all are more beautiful than somebody.
A girl called me ugly one time. I asked what her boyfriend looked like, she didn’t have one. No wonder! Now she was a beautiful girl, I can’t steal that from her, but I shot back you have no boyfriend and Selena Gomez is 10,000 times prettier than you. Of course I apologized and I just wanted her to see how it felt to be looked down on.
All I’m saying is you’re a “flower,” so grow where you are planted. You will be as beautiful as you allow yourself to be inside and out."

“But mom, it’s super hot outside and I’m about to melt to death,” I pouted.
“Well Kate honey, stay inside under the AC and you won’t have to melt or die,” my mom snickered.
“Mom, that’s not fair. Everyone is outside today.”
“You mean little Bobby Johnson is out there.” Mom laughed.
“Mom that’s not funny, I don’t like him.” I lied.
“Mmhm, of course you don’t honey, just remember what your dad said, no boys until you’re 30.”
Back Outside:
“Hey Kate,”
“Hey Bobby”
“You didn’t get any ice cream?” asked Bobby
“No, my mom won’t give me sweets before dinner.”
“Hey, take the rest of my ice cream”
“No, I better not, but thanks anyway.” I said
Then Bobby says “Look, Mr. Jones is opening the fire hydrant, I’ve got to go put on my trunks.” And he took off running to his house, so I went back into my house to find something to get wet in.
“Kate, what are you doing in there honey?”
“Just looking for my bathing suit because Mr. Jones just opened the hydrant up.”
“Woa, woa, woa young lady, first off you didn’t ask me if you could play in the water.”
“Mom, pleeeeease, it’s so hot. I’m going to melt and die if I don’t get in the water, pleeeease mommy.” I whined and battered my baby blues at her.
“Girl, you are too much. Ok listen. First only for an hour because you have to come in and eat dinner when Dad gets home and second put on shorts and a T-shirt. We don’t want little Bobby Johnsone seeing that you’re starting to need a training bra”
“MA!”
“I’m just saying, honey.”
Outside again:
I got my sand pail, and I’m going to drown Bobby with it! Wait, what’s that he’s got? Not fair, he’s got a Bazooka Soaker.
“Bobby you better not shoot me with that thing.”
“Why not, you are going to drown me with that bucket of water, aren’t you?”

Two streets over he spotted a ThotPol team, and he knew they were after him. He tried to flee more inconspicuously. “Run casual,” he thought of himself.
PING! chimed his wearable, and a little orange pip in his upper left visual field notified him of yet another LikeThink posting. He still hadn’t disabled the app, and he was too panicked to focus on Privacy mode.
“^VedWillBearIt888 thinks Damn! ThotPol! Run casual.”
PING! “^VedWillBearIt888 thinks <@#-Family Mode Active-#@> Shut up, LikeThink! Off! Um...okay, concentrate.”
Ved paused to breathe and focus. Taking a few seconds, he shut down all social apps, disabled SafeWhere to avoid public tracking (a bit pointless, as ThotPol didn’t need privs to locate him, but at least he might avoid more Doxbrats* throwing trash at him), and altered his fabric coloration to try and blend in when he found a crowd. He headed north, thinking to make for a public gathering.
As he came out of a narrow alley onto a backstreet, he ran smack into two ThotPol trackers. The creepy kid-sized prototypes they’d been using lately. This pair (always pairs for tracking) looked as if they’d been at some kind of dance recital or gymnastics thing, but the whip chain cable was serious business.
When Ved ran into them, the optics of his wearable had fallen off and Ved had ended up on his but, scrambling back from them, trying to catch his breath. One of the pair stared down at the optics, the other looked at Ved (or so he assumed - their anonymous facial obfuscation made it hard to tell).
“Vedoran Barret,” emoted the one staring at him, “pseudentity VedWillBearIt eight, eight, eight.” It was not a question.
“Confirmed unit, optics,” stated the one who now picked up his wearable optic by the frame.
“Okay, Meat,” resumed the first one, shifting its stance to what Ved assumed was a tactical position, in case Ved ran. “Stand and be escorted. Don’t resist, and we won’t use the chain, got it?” He mentally named this Thing 1, the other Thing 2.
Ved sighed, resigned, rose to his feet, picking tiny rocks off his palms and waiting for the clamp. “It was a bug,” he offered lamely.
Thing 1 scoffed, a clamp extending from its sleeve to secure Ved’s forearms to his torso. “Sure, always is,” it went on, shaking its head. Then, to Thing 2 “Meat always say that, don’t they?”
“Like recordings,” agreed Thing 2, adding, “Can they even pass a Turing Test at this point?” Both of them laughed. Ved didn’t.
As he shuffled toward a pickup drone for ThotPol, Ved had the notion that he wished he’d just left LikeThink running, so it could finish condemning him.

Almost like that of a slave mentality; simply accepting my circumstantial fate as something I could neither change, nor prevent its inception into my life.
To not only see from outward, but inward as well, the totality of my circumstances would be but a blessing. Unfortunately often we, and I mean almost all of humanity, are blind until after our circumstances are revealed to us, and for good or bad we must face the consequences.
Having grown in these contemporary times led not by knowledge, but a sense of self worth that coincided with the mentality of the inner city male demographic, that often called for anger, distortion and a constant need to show how alpha one was. This psychosis more than not leads to what I call a “worthless need to belong.” That at times ends more often than not in one's absolute subjection to the institution of “the new Jim Crow,” a term that was coined by Professor Michelle Alexander.
Rather it be the goal to obtain: drugs, money by the stack, women by the stable or cars by the lot. The mentality of the inner city male youth often involves violence and a mutual feeling of distrust and smoldering rage towards his perceived oppressor, most likely portrayed as the man in blue, and more specifically aimed at the white male hegemony. For it is these conditions of self-shacklement that often birth from one to another, the “see’s” and “I told you so’s,” and the psychosis of a worthless need to belong continues to turn anew.
The mental faculties that seem to be bred into each one of my station—that of an inner city upbringing. Rather male or female are far beyond bound, but something happens along the way, something that registers deep within our collective psyche, and because of this our potential for betterment is drastically reduced, and the factors that contribute are so common, so numerous that we have no escape other than sheer luck.
The circumstances of our youth thwart us from establishing a base and living a life of normalcy --the American dream."

El Chappo escapes and it makes front page headlines in the newspaper. The guy the movie “Blow” was based on gets out of federal prison and TMZ has reporters covering it. Some model gets busted with a couple of suitcases of drugs on an airplane and suddenly she’s made the rotation on CNN.
Kids see these people. They are famous. And who doesn’t want to be famous? A child doesn’t know the difference between famous and infamous.
So when kids who don’t have the greatest parents see all these drug dealers on tv, they look up to them. It’s all they have.
When they realize they aren’t gonna be the next Johnny Depp because their acting skills just aren’t up to par, they can’t shoot a basketball like Lebron James, and they don’t have a father figure who cares, then their dream to be famous doesn’t go away just because the talent it’s there. They think anybody can sell drugs and maybe get famous. It’s worth a try.
Hell, I was even stupid enough to try it, and I have good parents. So I really feel sorry for the kids who don’t.
My parents don’t do drugs. They don’t even smoke weed. I was taught that drugs are bad, and to stay away from people that do them. I listened until I was 18. It was all downhill after that.
Perhaps that’s another reason why I never felt happy and content using and selling drugs. As a kid, I thought people who did drugs and sold them were losers. So it was with shame when I looked in the mirror and saw that I wasn’t staying away from those people anymore. I had become them.
Drugs have done nothing but ruin my life. I’m 35 years old, been to prison 4 times, and done around 10 years. I’ve caused my mom a lot of tears, even my dad a few, and he’s not what you would consider a crying man. In fact, the only tears I can remember him crying were over me. Imagine living with that.    I can’t undo the hurt I’ve caused to the two people I love more than life itself, but I can be the man they raised me to be from this day forward. I no longer want to be like Pablo Escobar who’s now dead. I no longer want to be like El Chappo who’s in prison. I don’t want to be like the guy from “Blow” who lost his daughter. I want to be like William Sprayberry Sr. If I have a daughter of my own, I want her to be like Brenda Moore, who’s my mom. Those are my parents. I thank God they were my role models. If the world put amazing people like these on the front page of newspapers it would be a much better place. We’d still make mistakes, but we’d also know better."

I was to change his clothes, warm his bottle, feed him, change his diaper, sponge bath his tiny body, slather his wrinkled skin with Johnson’s baby oil and powder his little bottom. I would hold him in my arms and rock him to sleep so as not to disturb her.
In less than 24-hours, I had become James’s constant companion. In less than a week, I had trained myself to wake up for his feedings and had instituted a daily routine to accommodate my duties. My mother had forced me to become his mother at the age of eleven. The truth was that I would never have the mother or the childhood that everyone else did.
James became my son in every sense of the word and the bond that forged between us was strong and unique. I protected him as a lioness would her cubs. I would have given my life for this golden child who had taken my heart. I vowed to be the best mother I could be so he would never know the pain of that empty void.
I watched him change and grow from year to year. I heard his first words and encouraged him to take his first steps. I weaned him from a bottle at bedtime to sipping from a cup and sleeping through the night. I can still remember how excited I felt the first time he got a new tooth coming in and the first quarter the “tooth fairy” left him when he lost his front tooth.
He loved going to school and I was a faithful PTA mom. He was a very smart, funny, and friendly child. He enjoyed playing sports and I attended every game and cheered him on as any proud parent would. I kept a scrapbook to record his many achievements.
When I moved into my own apartment, James lived with me more often than he did at home. I bought his school clothes, supplies and always did my best to keep him up-to-date on the current fads. When I gave birth to my sons, he taught them all about being boys, everything from catching frogs in the rain to peeing in the bushes. He was always a father figure to them.
Ironically, when he was eleven years old, I was arrested and would never live in society with him again. He was a child and yet was the glue that held me together during a time when I thought I would die. As I was sentenced to life in prison, James stood up and vowed to help me come back home. He never once gave up trying to do that and we remained in constant contact.
At fifteen years old, he met Corrie and fell in love. They were married at 18 and had two sons together. On their wedding day, he held a photo of me so I would be with him on his special day. When his first son, Davis, was born, he held my photo against the glass in the nursery window so we could gaze at him together. What an honor it was to become an aunt.
He was an amazing young man who would do anything to help anyone he could. He had a soft spot for children, the elderly, the less fortunate and the animals. He was dedicated to working with The Boys Ranch, YMCA, and Big Brothers and even became a Master Boys Scout. A more gentle soul could ever have been found had they searched the world over.
He was a son, brother, uncle, father to three sons, and stepfather to two sons and two daughters, a hard worker, a loving husband, and a respected member of his community. He was an angel here on earth loaned to us by his creator.
He was called home on December 14th, 2006, and I miss him more than mere words could possibly express. He is still the wind beneath my wings and my life is far more the richer for being blessed with his presence in my life for 30 priceless, memorable years. I anticipate the day I will join him for a family reunion.
RIP James!"

It began with me standing on the top of the highest mountain around. In real life I really enjoyed jumping off the edge of hills to see how far I could jump, so, naturally, the idea sparked within the dream.
I made sure to get a good running start, and I jumped out as hard as I could. I didn’t jump as far as I expected to. Instead, I kept going, over other mountains, over forests, over fields and water. I didn’t know what was going on, but, man, it was so cool. LOL!!!
I kept going until I approached a familiar mountain top. The closer that I got to it, the more I descended. Eventually landing right back where I had begun that journey.
Though I had never experienced flying in real life, this dream allowed me the experience of being high above mountains, trees, water, etc...looking down upon them all, while the air hit me in the face, rushing past. Actual flight.
After that such dreams became a common occurrence. I was jumping for long distances, and even actually flying. Oh, yeah, as embarrassing as it is to admit, some of the flying involved me actually flapping my arms. LOL!!! Hey, I’m a Lark, what can I say.
Check this out, though...within the dreams where I would flap my arms to fly, I found that the wind and air had layers that allowed me to raise my arms and place my hands on the highest layers that I could reach, then lift myself up. Each time I did this I would go higher and higher, basically flapping my arms. So, it wasn’t that bad. LOL!!!
Now, out of all of my flying experiences there was one that was out of this world. Literally!
The month before I was locked up I experienced flying like I’d never known. It began with me in my living room, then suddenly being outside, in the middle of the parking lot. From there I started rising into the air, without trying.
I rose higher and higher, not able to stop it. Rising above the apartment complex, my home town, I didn’t know what was going on. I kept rising higher than I’d ever known before, and still kept going, faster the higher I got.
The next thing that I knew, I was actually leaving the Earth’s atmosphere, leaving Earth. I past by the moon, by other planets, and still kept going. Needless to say, the situation had me a bit concerned, but the view was spectacular.
I then noticed something that I wasn’t expecting. I was coming up on what seemed to be the end of space as we know it, and the beginning of the nothingness, blackness. It was like a wall of separation. Though at that wall was something in the shape of a heart with a curved tip. A seed of sorts, from what it looked like, because the universe seemed to sprout from it. Yet, I was approaching it rapidly.
Once I got to it, I slowed, then passed through to the other side. I then found myself in a chamber or something, where the only light came from the window behind me that I had passed through. Beside me, in front of the window, was a silverish stool, the top in the shape of the heart seed, and upon it there were three buttons. Hoping that the buttons would help me get home, I sat down and pressed one. It worked, I awoke back at home. It’s a shame that I can’t do that now. LOL!!!
Anyway, that’s some of my experiences with flying. I hope you enjoyed them. LOL!!!"

I had planned on driving all the way across Montana stopping only for gas and nature calls until reaching South Dakota, however my plans were foiled by State Trooper “Taggert” just outside of Billings. Officer Taggert red-lighted me for speeding, I was driving a 505 Peugeot turbo station wagon and it was such a smooth ride I didn’t even realize I was traveling at speeds in excess of seventy-five miles per hour. A part of my amends process is to try and locate officer Taggert, pay the twenty dollar speeding ticket and apologize for not following up on my promise to her to pay the ticket as soon as I reached Illinois.
I drove into Billings and parked near the small Greyhound station and fell asleep in my car. I slept blissfully for twelve straight hours. It may have been for twenty hours had I not been awaken by a tapping on my window. I looked up hesitantly, half expecting to see a cop, however it was no cop, it was two attractive young women in their early twenties. One of them was a buxom blonde, the other a petite brunette.
(When I saw this picture of the girl with the bangs lying on the bench, she reminded me of the brunette and this was a good way to finish my Road Trip Saga…)
Anyways, the girls, local strippers were heading to the Big Apple to pursue their dreams. I told them that I was going as far as Chicago and that they were more than welcome to catch a ride. The brunette, whose name was “Trish” (Stage name Trish the Dish) said that they had friends in Madison, Wisconsin and if I could drop them off there, they would be “really appreciative”. What’s a guy to do? I too explained that since I was in the neighborhood I planned on partying in Sturgis for a few days. They both were game and so off to Sturgis we went.
There must have been over five thousand bikers in Sturgis. I had never had that much fun at a mass party before. There was a huge blue garbage container with probably a thousand cases of ice-cold beers floating in it. Debbie, the buxom blonde, won a wet T-shirt contest. We did coke, acid, ‘shrooms’, etc. for three straight days with no sleep. I seen more bare breast that weekend than I had at Mardi Gras.
We drove to a small town near Watertown, SD and decided to spend the night. We found a small rustic local watering hole and went inside for some pool and a few pitchers. We stuck out like a sore thumb. I felt several sets of hostile eyes upon me and even more lustful eyes upon my two passengers. Somehow Trish and Debbie livened the place up and began stripping atop the long, well-worn bar counter.
The crowd of men were going wild, a little too wild. Some of the more intoxicated gents began trying to grab and paw at the girls. At first they took it in stride and then it began to piss them off. Debbie kicked some big burly drunk right in the kisser. He tried grabbing her off the bar and I interjected. I smashed him in the exact spot Debbie had kicked him sending a spray of blood across his shirt. Trish had jumped on the large fella and began biting his ear. As he “yeowed” in pain, trying to shake off the wildcat whom also drew blood, another gent stepped up and smashed a gnarled fist into Debbie’s kidneys. After that all hell broke loose. Long story short, I got the crap kicked out of me. When the opportunity presented itself we ran for the doors. We made a beeline to the outskirts of Ortonville, Wisconsin. We parked in a secluded area and did some wicked lines and then each other. I had fallen in love/lust for the third time on this trek to Chicago.
Trish was just my type. Petite, dark haired, blue-eyed, nice shape with peach sized breast. I think that the attraction was mutual. Debbie sensed this and after our three-way-romp-in-the-hay excused herself and allowed me and Trish to have a more intimate time together.
Early the next day we reached Madison. We stopped at a park and this photo really reminds me of what Trish looked like that morning. We had to sadly say goodbye. I felt that i almost convinced her to go on the Shy-town with me, but she was committed to her longtime friend Debbie. We said our goodbyes, Trish shed a tear that tore at my heartstrings. We had no way of keeping in touch.
Well, I drove on that day to the southside of Chicago and lived near the windy city for about a year. I managed to clean myself up for a while and my wife and daughter actually moved out to Chicago to be with me. It was a long trip."

I had put it aside, as mainly chapter readings: then on my birthday, Feb. 13, 2014. Staff retaliated against me, by placing a nut job gang drop act in my cell with knowledge of where my spinal discs at L-4-S-1 impinged my spine. Painful yet I could still walk while count started, I was facing away from my torpedo cellmate, learning over, back vulnerable. Suddenly, I was hit, hobbit punches all over L-4 to S-1, and dropped to the floor. 10 seconds later the guard was there, and the guy spread an eagle and laughed. I never have walked since, I’m wheelchair bound.
The inmate laughed because he knew he would be rewarded by staff I had reported to internal affairs for serious physical abuses. He was brought back to my cell block the same night. I knew then I may never live to see my work finished. The staff put the attacker in another elderly litigators cell-that man won 3 million a few years before and had an outside attorney-get here staff was so artistic as to have the man attacked in his sleep less than 2 days after my attack. The young attacker used a boot to beat the old guy bloody in his sleep. Again they moved to another block, no ad-Seg, no SHU, just took away his privileges. In 10 blocks, again he is placed in another older litigators cell. But-the block officer had just got fined, demoted over my lawsuit-He had learned better than to allow it-He, in good conscious, cuffed up the kid on the spot and said “not in my block,” your history-he went straight to the top and had the laughing attacker shipped out to concern SHU. That officer grew as a human because I had stood up to his abuse a couple years before, through federal court action. He was not mad at me, but was humbled over his own shortcomings. His fellow staff hated me over it-which is why the guard went the extra mile to do the right thing.
I came back to my cell that night, and talked to my creator as to what to do. That night I pulled out my trusty Brother Electric typewriter. Pulled out my chapter outlines, and started typing out my “Life’s work,” my “life's purpose.” In 6 weeks I completed my book “Cold Black Heart Syndrome.”
My sista May and I made a business deal. I refuse charity but will take a loan. She paid a $1000 to have it edited, plus $200 for my original art to be digitized for the cover and interior.

“In the blink of an eye”- your mom could die from an undetected bump in her breast, as tears so desperately ran down your face, i can relate, it’s everlasting pain, as your whole world rocks, your pain spins without the axis, meaning your world has no rotation, direction, order, nor balance
“In the blink of an eye”- you could develop a strong sense of hatred towards a parent, who told you no to extending your curfew/ increasing your allowance, so you invade their gun cabinet and revamp Columbine, Pulse, Sandy Hook, Parkland.
“In the blink of an eye”- 2 planes can crash! On the side of a building that kills thousands of people, when the war gets brought to NYC, when Nas and Alicia Keys do concerts for free, do you not understand that’s a 9,000 mile trip? All for one moment of bragging rights, however if someone invaded your country and stole oil from your people or dropped a bomb on your people could you call this karma? Because none of us choose where we are from or look like, our teachings mold us into who we turn out to be.
“In the blink of an eye”- we could all unify to change these manmade false perceptions of how we view life, by getting the knowledge. For ourselves, insteads of being misled into groups not designed for us, only to use, or to disenfranchise us from one another, when behind the veil we are all the same.
“In the blink of an eye”- we could stop killing unarmed men/women whose only weapons were cell phones, skittles, cigars, traffic tickets, hoodies, BB guns, or making cigarette sales.

At the end of the pier, a shadowy figure appeared to be sitting down, feet possibly dangling in the water.
“Here, here’s the enlargement,” I quickly told him, unfolding the Xerox and handing it to him. “Look at the head.” I instructed him. “Someone is coming out of the water!”
After a long moment of consideration, my desk manager said, “You’re right, there is something here. Looks like a nose and lips. Dim, but pretty unmistakable.”
“I found it posted on the bulletin board at the Woolworths. It’s just like the one from the Western Auto two weeks ago except in that one, it was an unknown pier leading into the ocean. And it’s very similar to the picture I saw on the safeway board a couple of months ago, only that time the shadowy figure was walking up a beach.”
“You know the difference between those first two pictures and this latest one?” He asked me, interrupting my rambling.
“No, what do you think?”
“I know where this one was taken.”
“Where is it? You have to tell me.” I said, placing the pictures back into my coat pocket.
“Me and the ol’ lady took a vacation a few years ago. We stayed at a resort called The Overlook. Down the road from there, there was an old restaurant we ate at called the Prairie Schooner. I took a smoke on that very pier one night after dinner.”
Giving me directions, I realized it was only a few hours drive. I gassed up the Packard at the corner Pointers and hit the road. It took me longer than expected and after having to ask directions twice, I found the Schooner. I parked my car beside the building just as the sun was coming up behind me.
The stone covered parking lot crunched under my shoes as I habitually lit a cigarette with my Zippo and made my way into the mist covered lake. The crunching turned to silence as I left the parking lot and made my way quietly across the dew-coated grass. My cigarette made a hiss when I flicked it away in the distance and I stepped onto the pier. The smell of the water was intoxicating.
Reaching the end of the pier, I saw nothing unusual at all, just the glassy surface of the water reflecting the dim sky. I took a step back and reached into my breast pocket for another smoke and pulled the Zippo from my right pocket, scanning the distant horizon as the sun steadily rose behind me. Halfway to its intended purpose, I closed the Zippo and dropped it back into my pocket slowly. The unlit cigarette dangled precariously, from my bottom as I stared in awe at the hole in the water that had silently appeared without my notice. It was right at the end of the pier, not large, probably three feet wide and five feet long. The water stopped right at the edge of the hole. I didn’t see any drips. It was as if something was holding it back.
I dropped the forgotten cigarette onto the pier when a set of rust, metal stairs slid slowly up out of the opening in the lake with a wet, muffled clanking sound that reminded me of the old wooden roller coaster as it climbed up the first incline that I used to ride in my childhood summers.
Curiosity being my game, I stepped down onto those rickety steps taking a quick glance over my shoulder to the safety of my Packard still parked beside the closed restaurant. The stairs lead down 30 or 40 feet at a pretty steep angle and the underwater passage had a luminescence of greens and blues that shimmered from the morning sun.
I continued down until I reached the damp, sandy bottom. Curious of the walls, I took notice of an extraordinary issue; the walls looked like they were held back by a chain-link fence, only with much larger squares and the fencing material was transparent and fine like 10-pound fishing line.
The water this “fence” held back bulged considerably inside each square as if struggling to break through but restrained by an incredible surface tension.
Taking several steps up the sandy path, I began to feel an incredible sensation of lightness, a buoyancy as it were, almost as if I were actually in the water. The further I walked, the lighter I became. This was madness. What trick of gravity was I witness to?
Reaching out, I examined the weird wall of water that reminded me of the pastel orange seat backs in the diner at the Howard Johnson’s. Like a pleated cushion, but this one transparent, not opaque orange. I probed it with one finger, lightly touching one of the pillowed centers and found that my finger easily penetrated the surface. Quickly pulling my hand back, I expected the water to come crashing in. I was surprised to find only a couple of drops followed my shaking hand back. These drops floated for a moment before slowly making their way to the ground with a soft plop.
I kept looking back, towards the stairs, half expecting them to fold back into their underwater position, and found I’d come quite far from the opening at the end of the pier when suddenly, from the unexplored depths of the passage, a voice.
“There’s no need to be frightened,” came the low grumbling of an ancient terror. “You are with us now. Those of nature forced to hide from the sun, no longer in our coffins, but protected by the fathoms of water above.”
The greenish-blue shimmering light reflected off of his marble-white face as he took a step closer. His eyes glowed a dim yellow, penetrating, mesmerizing. I felt fear but I could not turn to flee. A part of me wanted to step forward into his embrace.
From over his shoulder, I noticed several more figures, each with those dimly glowing eyes. Far, far away I heard a sound not unlike the rollercoaster of my childhood summers: clank, clank, clank."

There are tales of how so many were beyond rich and how they lived on the street. To be honest with you, if I walk into a room and it is trashed, then this person lived that way on the street or he lived with his parents.
One thing I can say about Mr. George: His room was clean and no awful smell. It was neat and fresh. He lived alone in his cell. So we talked and shared life’s possibilities. I told him of my future plans upon release.
The week before my release, he handed me a brown clasp envelope. I was to open it on the way to the airport. Coffee stained the front cover. The corners were battered and had been taped back in place.
“You take this, young man,” he said as his voice trailed off in defeat. “I have held on to this dream for years. Now it is fading like myself.” His age told he had been here for sometime and was getting tired of being confined. His voice was low and the rasp told me he was getting worse as the days went on.
I know who is for real and not just another person who deserves to be here. I listened to him with all he said. His eyes told that he was sincere with his comment. I thanked him for the positive note. Follow the information I provided inside. File the paperwork once there, giving my name as a reference. I smiled and walked to my room.
The day had finally come for my release. The bag held all what I would need for a couple of days. I turned to see if I could spot Mr. George on the yard before leaving through the gate. He was not in sight.
The flight would take hours, then I would be in the state of Alaska. A short nap and being free wasn’t all that different or important at the moment. I dreamed of Mr. George and the time we shared. It finally hit home before the plane started to land. Mr. George was passing away. Not only did the sadness set in. I was now living his dream also.
I had been living in Alaska for more than two months when a letter arrived. It was from one of our friends at the prison. He wished me well and told of how Mr. George passed away holding the photo of myself sitting on the pier. My feet resting in the water.
A true friend is hard to find. I had that for sure in Mr. George. There will be no more count times or standing counts for either of us. Just good peace and quiet. He had his dream and so did I.
I had Mr. George’s body flown to Alaska and he and I now share the land. Most of all it started out his dream first. It is only proper that we both share it."

They leave a package for me. A few bars of soap, toothpaste, and a couple matches. Twice a year, I get a bundle of blankets and some new clothes. Never enough to be warm, but at least I don’t freeze. Sometimes if I build enough they include some food or chocolate in the package. This is the only outside food I get, so I always try to build as much as I can.
I used to lay in wait near the beach and try to catch the people who leave the packages. One time, I finally saw them late in the night, and tried to talk to them I was so hungry for conversation that I charged out of my hiding place, jabbering too fast to even be understood. The package bringers did not answer, they just got back in their boat, and left. I got no packages that month and it was a long cold month with no matches for a fire. So I built even faster and the next month they left two cans of spam and a chocolate bar. Work always equaled treats.
A few years ago I finished the outer wall. The top row was almost twice my height and I had had to use a crude ladder, fashioned out of driftwood, to put the cap stones on. What now? What could the watchers want me to build next? Finally it came to me!
The next morning I began my maze. Starting at the steps going down to the beach, I built a labyrinth of walls just wide enough for one person to walk through. I made the walls snitch back upon itself, twisting around and around. I built in several false trails and dead ends. It didn’t seem that the watchers cared exactly what I built, the rules were the same. More building, more treats.
Last night, I heard something that I have not heard in many years. Voices. They were not the sound of the birds, or the wind, or even the sound of my own voice echoing off the walls of my maze. The conclusion was clear. There were people, many people on my island.
From the location of the sound, they had already found the entrance of my maze and were trying to reach my hut. I ran as fast as I could through my maze to my hut, blew out my candle and stomped out my little cooking fire. I spent the night huddled under my ratty blanket in the corner of my hut listening to the intruders as they tromped around my maze trying to find me. I closed my eyes wishing that they would leave my island alone. After many fearful hours I fell into a fitful sleep.
The morning dawned bright and clear. The birds called their hello's while fishing for their breakfast. The voices, the intruders were gone. I had no bricks to build with today. The watchers would notice and there would be no treat in the package this month. But, this doesn’t matter to me anymore. The people were gone and I have my solitude once again. They never found me.
My prison had become my fortress."

In order to meet up, my mom and dad had to cross enemy territory. Back then, Philly was strictly divided into neighborhoods, each with their own racial, religious, and economic boundaries. Those who were brave (or foolish) enough to cross them were dealt with severely. Fishtown and Kensington were perfect examples of this dichotomy, and its teenagers were constantly at war.
Unlike the Fishtown boys who beat up my dad whenever they saw him, his friends were always very protective of my mom whenever they ushered her onto their turf. I chuckle whenever I try to imagine my prissy mom “slumming” it on Kensington’s grimy streets, among its abandoned buildings, hookers, bums, and drug addicts and dealers -- a far cry from Fishtown’s tidy houses and stores and more family-friendly environment. Even funnier is picturing my mom climbing through my dad’s second floor bedroom window.
This went on for about a year and a half before my mom got pregnant. They were both only 15, which obviously posed major problems.
My mom conspired with her friends on ways to explain what had happened that didn’t involve the obvious -- all the while my mom was wearing baggy clothes to conceal me growing inside her. It wasn’t until her mom confronted her that my mom revealed that she was pregnant.
Her mom wanted her to give me up for adoption, which my mom considered until the nuns came from the adoption agency to start the process.
Her dad, my Grandpop Mckeown, had a much more violent idea: if my mom didn’t agree to have an abortion, he would cut me out of her stomach himself.
My mom remained defiant, wanting to have me despite the many obstacles I’d present.
And so I was born, almost three months premature, on September 8, 1981. I spent my first few months in an incubator and was so tiny, I could fit in the palm of a hand.
My dad wanted to name me Ulysses after his pet hamster. My mom ended up naming me Chad after a kid whose mom kept yelling his name on the playground while my mom was pregnant. My mom wanted to give me her maiden name, Mckeown, but both my grandmothers made her name me “Frank,” my dad’s last name. Who knows why, since his father’s last name was Bunning. It’s a big, long story that I’ve not been able to fully sort out.

**

Realizing he needed to grow up and take care of his responsibilities, my dad decided to enlist in the military. But not before one last fling to celebrate his 18th birthday.
He and his friends got drunk and high at Tewey. At one point, my dad decided to come visit my mom. Since he’d spent all of his money on booze and weed, he didn’t have any carfare to catch the El, so he decided to transurf. His friend Spider tagged along. My dad had transurfed countless times, but this was Spider’s first time, so my dad had to guide him every step of the way.
First they scaled onto the roof of a nearby building. Then they dropped onto the awning of the El stop and waited for a train to pull in. When one did, they climbed atop of it and proceeded to “surf” as the train went clattering down the tracks. Things went well until they neared a trestle. My dad turned to tell Spider to duck. His reflexes dulled, my dad was unable to heed his own advice, and whacked his head. He was thrown from the train, onto the street below. Dead on impact.
Having witnessed my dad’s violent death, Spider was never the same again. Though I never met him, I hear he became a hopeless drunk and drug addict, trying to blot out the traumatic memory.
Sensing a damsel in distress, guys swooped in to try to rescue my mom, but she was too busy trying to figure out how to raise herself and me alone. Meanwhile, my Grandmom Frank was busy filing lawsuits and selling off my dad’s belongings. She was off to the gambling boats in Mississippi before the dirt settled on my dad’s grave.
My mom was forced to grow up quickly. Instead of becoming a dental hygienist and marrying a dentist on the Main Line, she dropped out of high school just months shy of graduating and got a job at a donut shop. That’s where she met my stepdad, Bobby.
Bobby was everything my mom could’ve asked for: a tall, dark, and handsome bad boy with a good job and a car -- both of which promised escape from her increasingly dysfunctional home life. Her stepdad Petey was an abusive drunk who demanded my mom hand over half her paychecks to live there. At any given moment, he’d put out guns and threaten to kill everyone in sight.
At first, Bobby treated my mom with respect and we bonded over a mutual love of pro wrestling. That all changed after my mom and Bobby got married when I was three. Bobby morphed into a monster whenever he got drunk, which was every weekend, viciously beating my mom while I watched on terrified and helpless.
I held out hope that things would get better, but they only got worse when my sister was born when I was six. In order to cope with my constant pleas for attention and my sister’s incessant crying, Bobby drank and got high more frequently. By then, my family was living in Port Richmond, a working-class neighborhood known for its boxing gyms. Our living room was a boxing ring, and I constantly had to barricade myself and my sister in my bedroom to avoid becoming Bobby’s next sparring partners. These memories are battered into my brain.
Somehow Bobby was able to stay out of prison and maintain gainful employment. My mom was also able to get herself a position as an office manager. By the time I was 16, they were able to earn enough money to move to the Far Northeast. One would think that such upward mobility would domesticate Bobby’s inner beast, but it didn’t. Normally tranquil suburban weekends became warzones.
Over the years, Bobby has been given chance after chance: my mom taking him back again and again, getting out of jail with just fines or community service, employer-funded stints in rehab, being cured of Hep C, and most profoundly and perplexing, being allowed in his grandson’s life. Yet, he remains an abusive asshole. And for this, I hate him. I’ve not been given one good chance, let alone as many as Bobby has and he doesn’t even appreciate it. But Karma is starting to catch up with him. Years of drinking and drug abuse have taken their toll on his body and mind, and he’s become a shell of his former self. And his abusive ways have alienated him. I refuse to talk to him, my mom is planning on divorcing him, and my sister limits access to his grandson’s life.
Through it all, my mom and I have remained close. We’ve practically grown up together, and have endured so much. Too often, we were all we had. Even after I disappointed her and let her down by coming to prison, we have remained close. Though we are hundreds of miles apart (she is still in Philly, while I am in North Carolina), we talk on the phone almost every night, and she comes to visit as often as possible. And for all of this, my mom is the most important person in my life."

He sat down and waited. He waited a long time until he was thirsty and went to eat snow. He heard a stream of water nearby, but he didn’t know what a stream was. Water came from the sky, or a round green thing attached to the house. He didn’t know the round thing that sent water was green, but it looked different than anything. The dog wondered where the man went. When would he come back? The dog was scared at new sounds and smells.
Much time passed and the sky went dark. It was cold and wet, when clouds moved in. The dog knew about clouds, he knew the smell of water from the sky. There wasn’t shelter for the dog, but he found a funny smelling tree with low hanging breaches. The dog went under the branches and laid down. Cold and hungry, sleep was fitful, and many sounds woke the dog through the night.
Late in the dark the dog dreamt of a time when a tree was in the house. The good man sat with the little puppy by the tree and hung shining things from its branches. They laughed and the dog laid down beside them happy. The dog woke to sounds of birds and sunlight.
He stayed near the place the man drove the car away from. Days past and the dog had found the stream but no food. He was hungry and chewed on leaves and branches. He whined and was filled with sorrow. The man wasn’t coming back. Everything he knew was gone and no one would find him or feed him. He eventually wandered into the forest scarred but not caring. He found a bush filled with sweet fruits and ate.
Long into the night the moon shined down on him as he gasped and cried. The berries were poison. He didn’t know what berries were, or what poison was. All he knew as he lay dying was sorrow. His stomach was a burning pit of flame, his head pounding, his breath fading.
Then, a call came to him. The pain was gone and the sun was warm. The birds chirped and sang. He sat up and running to him were the good man and the man’s puppy. They hugged him and pet him and danced. They gave him fresh food, and odder than it all was that wasn;t in the forest at all. He was home and he went inside with the good man and the puppy. The woman was there and everyone was happy. The tree was inside and there were shining eggs hidden all around the house.
Somewhere far away a pack of coyotes found a large hunk of fresh meat. It smelled like them in some ways, but they didn’t hesitate to eat. The men had built big wooden boxes all over the forest, and the coyotes lost hunting ground, they had to eat whatever they could find, and that day in the field on Abandon was a day when a coyote’s stomach would be filled. It was a good day."

We’re all trying to hold straight faces, but it isn’t working.
“Come on damnit! Give me my stuff. I can’t get out with nothing to wear,” DJ yells, putting his “gift” down.
“You have something to wear. Open your present and see.” Red’s trying to look innocent. I wonder what could be wearable in that box? After more argument, DJ satisfies our curiosity and opens his present. Out falls a hot pink, Crochet g-string (Crochet is one of the authorized hobby-crafts).
Dropping the box and its contents, DJ backs away. He’s bright red with embarrassment. He glares at us all as we’re laughing so hard, “You F__ ahole.” He yells at Red, “No way I’m wearing that!”
DJ and Red are going at it: DJ tries to get his things, and Red holds firm. DJ is also pleading with us all to help, but none of us will because this is just too funny. Finally with a lot of coaxing, we get DJ to put the g-string on--he stays in the shower though. (I wouldn’t have put it on if it were me). Red gets up after a while, takes DJ’s things to our cell, walks over to the shower, and pulls the door open before DJ can stop him. We’re all laughing so loud I’m surprised the guards don’t hear us. DJ stands there a moment, indecisive. The shower light illuminates him from above, showing his red hair and face, pale freckled skin, and chubby stomach and legs wrapped only in a hot pink crochet g-string. Suddenly, he bolts out the door, and as he turns toward our cell, his shower shoes slip out from under him. He crashes to the floor landing with a loud SPLATTT, sliding to a stop in front of me. He scrambles up and disappears into our cell with a huge round of applause, slamming the door behind him.
The dayroom is in an uproar with everyone laughing and congratulating Red on his successful practical joke. This continues most of the night, and DJ didn’t talk to Red for almost two weeks which for him, a long time to hold a grudge.
Ironic as this may sound, DJ kept the g-string. The last time I saw him was on the streets. While we were reminiscing, the subject came up then DJ goes into another room and returns with a clear plastic bag with a hot pink, crochet g-string inside. “It reminds me of Big Red,” he says showing me the bag. “He died after he got out.”"

“You’re so corny.” She sniffed into his wool coat. “And what are you thinking, wearing wool in the rain? You smell like a wet dog!” He was always able to bring her moods around. The medication helped, but he was the best cure for a dark mood.
“I want to tell you something. And since we can’t sit down at Safora and enjoy an over-priced lunch first, I’ll tell you here in the shadow of the rain.”
“You’re so poetic,” he laughed. “What is it”
“I’m pregnant.” She stared at him, waiting for a reaction. His face was unreadable, then he began laughing hysterically. As she stood there, her initial irritation began to creep back.
When he reached into his pocked and pulled out a little, black velvet covered box, he revealed, “This is why I was really late.” He opened up a little box which on top, read “Tiffany’s” on and on bottom, sat the symbol of his love and devotion for her and their soon-to-be family."

Hold on, let me take a couple more pulls off this cigarette before my heart and body start yearning. It was about 16-17 years ago and it was with that handsome African prince, Teddy.
Lisa: I knew you were going to him…
Jennifer: LET. ME. FINISH. BEFORE. YOU. INTERRUPT!
(Lisa giggles and smiles)
Jennifer: We had went out to that Ethiopian Restaurant on the East Side on Liberia Way, had a delicious meal (very spicy, you know I love spicy). Afterwards we took a stroll through Kenya Park. Came out around the corner from Teddy’s home on Kemet Ave. We proceeded inside and giiirrrrrlll I just lost ALLLLL control when we crossed the threshold. He responded to my advances, wandering hands by entwining his hands with mine and kissing me so strongly but gently as he walked me towards the back of the home, his lips still on mine as we breathe as one. As we entered his room which was decorated in gold, red, black and green, he softly laid me down (Jennifer starts shivering as she recalls the memories) and for my very first time ever he gave me the most sensual full body massage with Coconut Carrot Oil (Hot). The O’s proceeded from that moment until Teddy finished making BEAUTIFUL, ELECTRIFYING, SWEET, STRONG, TENDER love to me 4 hours later. Even after we were done, I had to rest for several hours due to the continuous tingling of my body. WHOOOH!! That’s what you call making love. Everytime I think about it, I feel like I’M ON TOP OF THE WOORLD!!!

Between hearing the bookshelf crash as I sat on my porch with a cigarette to perform CPR on my 3-year-old son, I could never begin to discern where everything in my life fell apart. In contrast, the 3 days that followed, watching my heart break as he struggled on life support, only to slip quietly away, represents an epoch in my life unmatched by any other from my birth to now. Indeed, it is a moment that much extends until the last of my days, as it has never ended in my mind since and seems reluctant to do so.
As I sit in a 10x6 cell now, part of a world that for over 2 years now has been reticent to accept the ever present passage of time, I’m also peripherally aware of a sense of life passing by at its usually effervescent pace. It seems that while individual events may suspend us in here, and now like the tar pits of ages part, the overall tempo of our existence- both individually and as a whole, cannot be so easily mired. It is this awareness of time’s dichotomous nature that has helped me gain clarity into a simple truth- that although life has its ups and downs, you can stand resolute in the certainty that tomorrow is another day, another cycle of moments with the potential to bring us down or build us up, and while it isn’t promised (for no man can known when his day is come), what you can be sure of is that it’s passing will one day reflect but an instant in existence- the blink of an eye."

Faith warned, “Beth, you might want to hire a bodyguard after this, hon.”
After having taken several deep breaths to slow her pulse rate, Beth finally spoke her mind, “Wow. The trial ended 4 days ago. How long has she been following me?”
In the parking lot, one by one, the women hugged and consoled their clearly shaken friend. Before releasing her Michelle reassured, “If she was telling the truth, her statements would’ve been consistent with the footage. Don’t let her get to you, Beth.”
“I won’t”.
On the drive home, Beth kept checking her rear view for any followers. After several turns, she decided no stalkers tailed her.
Pulling into her condo’s lot, Beth’s mood shifted from worry to anger. Who the hell does she think she is, hunting me down?! She thought. She considered a restraining order, gun purchase, and Faith’s suggestion of a bodyguard. She needed to be more prepared.
But if she was honest with herself, the woman hadn’t been threatening. Her demeanor was calm, resolved. Her tone, sad. Like someone struggling with a broken heart.
On the ride up the elevator to her floor, Beth replayed some questionable elements of Karen’s claims in court. Floor 1- Karen claimed not to remember much from the night of her client’s yacht/sex party. Floor 2 - She claimed she must have been drugged. Floor 3 - The footage showed her sober, walking up to the doorman that gave all the women boarding a retinal scan and explanation of the agreement they were making coming to the sex party. This too, Karen did not recall.
Exiting at her floor Karen thought, Yeah, right.
She was convinced that Karen was just another gold digger looking to cash in on a rich athlete. This was the obvious conclusion that got her client acquitted. Case closed. But as Beth walked into her empty flat, dropped her keys on the counter, and sat down on the floor to stare out the window at the city skyline, all she could see was the sincere tears of a broken woman."

Bobby believed it was true love but Mikki Fox explained, to his dismay, she didn't love him back. Broken hearted, Bobby Ganderson called up Porcupine Patti on the phone and convinced her to return to him. This was not the “Happily Ever After” Bobby had hoped for. Porcupine Patti was immensely unhappy living in Sauk Village. Bobby surmised that this was mainly due to the fact that Porcupine Patti soon learned of the foxy feathered affair between badhered Bobby unmercifully until he relented and agreed to move back to California.
And so the Gandersons packed up and took a Greyhound back across the country to the West Coast.
A few months later Bobby “The Goose” Ganderson received a letter from his mother Dena. In the letter was a picture of beautiful baby goslings. Dena told her son that she strongly suspected that the gosling was his. As much as Bobby’s heart wanted to believe this was true, his mind told him that it wasn't. Bobby was not a very lucky bird. He truly felt as though he had a curse upon him or something of the like. Bobby stared at the beautiful baby gosling. When he turned the photograph over he discovered the young gosling’s name: Lysette Nicole. What a beautiful name, he thought to himself. He never forgot her name.
One day when the young Lysette was old enough she went on a secret quest to find her real father. When Mikki Fox discovered what Lysette was up to, she hurriedly snatched the young gosling up, placed her in a large basket stroller and whisked her away where she kept her isolated in a castle. Mikki Fox told Lysette that she had done a foolish thing. And for years to come, Mikki Fox held young Lysette captive in the castle until she was old enough to set out on her own.
Thirty years passed. Computers had made it much easier for folds to locate long lost relatives. Lysetter, now a beautiful goose with two goslings of her own decided it was time to finally unravel the mystery about her father. Through a DNA locating search engine she at long last had found her father. But as happy as she was, she was also just as sad. As it turned out, her father was a criminal and was serving a 25 year to life sentence in prison. Bobby “the Goose” Ganderson was a jailbird!
Lysette gathered up her courage and wrote her father a letter, not knowing what to expect. Bobby’s heart broke as he read her words. Tears of joy coursed down his cheeks. Today Lysetter and Bobby are trying to build a relationship. Today Bobby no longer feels sad, and Lysette? Well she’s just fine. This fairy tale is about family, failures, heartbreaks and uncertainties and how they can be overcome. Today, this is a “Happily Ever After” story. The End…"

I wore my hair short and thinned out, much like Mo and Larry of “The Three Stooges.” In the 6th grade, my hair grew down past my shoulders, and I started to wash it with an egg early in the morning before my parents got up. The egg straightened my now wavy and frizzy hair, but did not get rid of the frizz. Static electricity would make it stand up on end at the very top, and while experimenting with electricity in this way, I created a unique look for sixth grade.
For 7th through 9th grade, my thin belly and legs drew attention from boys more than my hair did, and so I wore it just whatever way. However, in 10th grade, I cut my hair into a long shag. By 11th, I got a perm which looked like a ball of fire. It was dry, and as it grew, I picked it into the largest orange ball you’d ever seen atop anyone’s head! This brightened my outlook immensely after my family relocated 3000 miles, and I missed my old friends. In 12th grade, I went back to my 4th grade look, but sometimes my hair was reddish.
I never officially colored my hair or even plucked my eyebrows until I was in my mid-twenties. Finally trying marked the beginning of my Gothic phase. At first, everything was black, even my eyebrows and lipstick, and my hair was cut very close to my head. I then tried herbal colorants, and those were various shades of red, blonde, and even burgundy. In fact, for nearly two decades, I colored my hair so many times, I had forgotten the true color of my hair!"

Two steps out of the water and I’m completely dry. Large torches along the walls blaze to life, their flames bathe the polished cavern in a pleasant warmth. Flowing calligraphy incisided in the walls begin glowing an incarnacline hue that urges me forward into the center of the cavern. The calligraphy swirls and shifts along the walls as I get closer, almost like it was anticipating, like it was somehow eager.
Once I’m standing in the cavern’s nucleus an intaglio ring of the same flowing calligraphy encircles me, its blood-red light tainting my skin. I sit down and cross my legs and take a few slow deep breaths as my eyes slowly close, as I quickly find my center.
I focus on my breathing, to the air coming in and out of my nose. I breathe in and pause;I breathe out and pause. When a thought pulls my attention away I acknowledge it and respectfully push it away, always returning to my breath. I am at peace.
Everything slowly dissolves into nothingness as I fall deeper into my trance. This is where the work happens, where the prestidigitation takes place, the mending of my soul. It’s here that I’m able to begin the difficult task of gluing together the dismantled pieces of my existence.
“Chowtime! Chowtime!” A deep baritone pierces the nothingness, bringing with it the sounds of boots on concrete, the jingling of brass keys, and the unoiled squeak of the food cart rolling my way. I’m dragged kicking and screaming back into the realm of ignorance, oppression, bigoted thoughts and sadistic intent.
I slowly open my eyes, relishing the calmness I’m feeling before it's ripped from my white knuckled fist. It all comes surging back: the anxiety, depression, stress, the non-stop chattering of the Drones, and the assiduous oppression tactics of the guards. I let out a sigh as I leave the safety of my meditation mat (my folded blue blanket).
A wave of food parts being slammed open surges down the tier towards me, carrying with it a medley of salty processed “meat” and rubber vegetables. BAM! My trap opens and I grab the tray and cup of tea flavored water. I scarf my dinner without tasting it, drink the “tea” and rush to brush my teeth. I’m in a hurry to return to my lair, my private refuge. BAM! I slide the tray out and make a mad clash for my mat.
I sit down once again and cross my legs, my hands resting in my lap, my eyes closing and then it happens…."

A pig (a particularly appropriate pseudonym, given his razor-backesque buzz cut, his overbloated pot beslly, and the sweat streak saturating his hog back-turning keys and squatting to put on shackles is hard work), while engages in the cumbersome procedure of placeing an over restrained prisoner in an outdoor rec. Cage next to mine, leered at his partner, chuckled, said “‘cause it was overtime I was making $50 an hour, for sitting in a van,'' talking about transporting a prisoner to the hospital (severely injured by another inmate).
Such piggish conversations are common amongst our captors, as if the commodities they’re escorting are too stupid to realize those pigs see us as mere commodities, not conscious of their sideways insult and degeneracy. Such pigs may only be homo (pun not intended to insult LGBTQs).
As I said, most people are unconscious as to their true character. It’s a self defense mechanism: if that pig, e.g., says himself as he truly is, he’d cut his miserable throat and hope for reincarnation as a higher life form, maybe a turd beetle.
Imagine the horror that pig must feel when his delusion occasionally falters and he sees what an irrelevant parasitical cog in a shitty machine he is!
They will never contribute anything beautiful or brilliant to human existence. They are content with preserving and passins on to their piglets their profitable purposelessness, like a cancerous social tumor.
That’s them. Let it not be us!
The purposelessness lives of prisoncrats (and inmates who, indirectly, play along with the P.I.C.) gives purpose to my own. While I’d rather be engaged in creating literary or visual art, my character impels me to expose and contest prisoncrats’ efforts to inflict purposelessness on their captives, to hold out and snip the strings leading from their limbs to their plutocrat puppet masters’ fat fingers. This is a purpose that every very wise ape in prison is honor bound to adopt as part of their raison d’etre.
Whether or not success is achieved, the goal is noble, pursuit, with vigor, is enough; as E.A. Poe said in “El Dorado,” “Ride, boldly ride.”

“If you seek El Dorado.”"

We know that faded giggle. It has followed us, “Look! There’s another one,” it whispers; and without turning my head, I can see the peripheral shadow move. Sometimes we get scared.
I’ve peed in these pants so many times it doesn’t matter anymore. It bothered me at first, but it helps. It’s warm on colder days. It washes away in the rain. It dries in the sun. Nobody wants us around anyways, so what difference does it make? We quit hoping others would care when others quit hoping they could. Fear and loneliness create a numbness after a while. It’s like those shadows. They lurk, they whisper, and they watch; but only from a distance.They are usually up ahead, but they have flanked us; and sometimes, they sneak up from behind. We have to stick together. Maybe the only reason we have survived so long is because we look out for one another - you and me.
We found a box with a biscuit and some chicken in it on the backside of that town two days ago. That really helped to put a muffle on our belly sounds. Everytime we pass a creek, or a stream, or a river, I fill up that old plastic Pepsi bottle we found. We have to keep our eyes open and watch for something to use as covers. Winter will come soon. Things are starting to bother me.
I’ve been wondering and worrying. When will they get tired of watching? When will they stop laughing? When will they stop lurking? And if they do, what will it mean? What will happen then? You are my only friend; but your eyes have been looking tired. Your cheeks have sunken in. Your spirit whispers hollow.
Oh my friend! When they leave, are you going to leave as well? When we stop again to get water, I will look deep into the wetness. When the ripples settle, I will look into your eyes and ask you again."

“So Donald how’d it go babe?”
“Well it's holding, my love, at least for now. We don’t have much time.”
“Well if we are going to die saving all of those people, I want it to be Naked. Me on top, this time.”
“Very well, take it all off for me.”
Melaney took off her clothes. It was a bit cold and her breasts stiffened. Both Donald and Melaney were making love sweating even in the cold. So Beautiful was their love for one another, they did not realize how close to death they really were. The hole expanded and ripped open to enormous proportions; as they were crashing into the water, Donald and Melaney looked at one another in ecstasy, both were one and exploded into crystalized atoms as the war heads exploded above them. Both of their souls intertwined into one pure soul and as they were being judged by the Lady of Justice, She Goddess Justicia forgave both for their greedy dispositions.
“When both of you make love at the same time the war heads exploded in tandem with both of your love orgasms and created a Love Vortex that opened a way for the love energy of the universe to repair your fractured world. Your remains were found by the Coast Guard and Teddy Roosevelt held your names in high honor! Both of you are free to reincarnate or enjoy your oneness together on here The Astral Plane. What say you?”
“We shall remain in oneness lady of Justice. For we cannot bear to ever be apart again. We are soulmates forever more. It is only once in a great millenia two soulmates meet and become one with another.

My breath was stuck in my throat and my mind was in turmoil. A part of me was looking out of the window and seeing only sky. And the adventurer in me was studying all of the wonderful electronics and wanting to touch everything.
Everyone, both pilots and the stewardess, were smiling and trying to talk to me. I looked at them and thought they were speaking Glosolaglia. I could not understand a word they were uttering. And when I said “what?!?!”, they all broke into fits of laughter which, in turn, made me laugh. Then the copilot asked me if I wanted to be a pilot and I replied, “No”. They all looked shocked. Then I said, “I just want to know how to fix this thing if it breaks or make it better.” The copilot then unbuckled his harness and proceeded to tell me what ALL of the lights, buttons, gauges and switches were used for.
I had a good time on my first flight, and ever since, I choose to fly wherever I go. I’ve been on 42 aircrafts in 12 years, 3 of which were helicopters during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. I went on one of the last concords to Hong Kong. Two fighter jets, and one propeller plane which scared the hell out of me.
I have dreams of flying while not using any form of mechanical device. It’s more like Neo on “The Matrix” or Superman. However, I love flying! Being in the air and looking down on city lights at night or the vast landscape of clouds below the plane.
Some may become enthralled in the wonder of how tons of metal can stay aloft. Yet, I study physics and have had a natural affinity for engineering since I was a child and could easily explain how an airplane can fly or how flight by any machine is possible.
No, for me, it is the freedom. And on a brief note: The first time I actually jumped out of an airplane…
I look out of the open door. I approach with a little trepidation. I hear only wind and see only sky. The craft is buffeted by powerful turbulence. Then I step forward and jump into the void, right out of the airplane by myself for the first time. With the 4 tandem jumps previously, it felt nothing like this. This was better than sex. The freedom. The speed. The near-nothingness but wind. The freedom of movement. The ecstasy.
I was flying."

To be this or to be that. At first this was a harsh shot to swallow. I was selfish and didn’t care anything about humanity as a whole. Constantly I asked myself, why me? I mean, who wants to be a slave to destiny?
That’s not a confession of being completely heartless though. I had just given it wholeheartedly to my lifemate, Lydia. The only time I wasn’t selfish was when it came to her. To say that I loved her doesn’t convey the half. So naturally when the murder rate hit and all time high and claimed her life with it, something in me snapped. The pain that I felt from the loss was indescribable. It was a pain that nobody should ever to endure. A pain that spread throughout society at a far quicker rate with me denying my role in the grand scheme.
I realized that somebody had to bear the burden so I accepted myself for who I was born to be. At all cost, it’s my responsibility to protect the living from the murderous walking dead. I started running with the pack and doing my part to exterminate the creatures of the night, yet my mind was still distracted. The numbness that I had slipped into was by far better than the initial shock and pain but served as a barrier that divided me from anything that felt normal or joyous.
A month passed by and the climate grew brutally cold. Snowflakes were falling from the sky in a rapid succession. Though I possessed the ability to shift into my wolf body, the conditions still make for exhaustively challenging hunting. A debate warred inside my mind of whether or not I wanted to brave such elements. Just as I was leaning toward staying in, I overheard an elder warning another hunter to keep an extra close eye on me. Tonight’s targeted cover was responsible for Lydia’s death. No way could I sit this one out.
Once we located the scent and were hot on the trial, I felt a buzz I forgot even existed. Through an opening in the canopy, a shining of the moon highlighted a slight movement of shadow against the white snow. Softly planting my paws, I crept in that direction. I was dead set on avenging the only person I had ever loved. As I made my way around a thick oak I caught sight of a vampire feeding mindlessly. With rage that would fill Bruce Banner with envy, I lunged at the monster, sank my teeth deep into his neck, and ripped it off his shoulders. The immortal being killed for the last time.
Releasing my jaws, the head fell to the ground and rolled half a turn. I looked up into the sky, past the falling snow at the moon, and released a long howl in victory.
Right there underneath the night sky, deep within, in a place that I had closed off, I felt a portion of myself that hadn’t been present since I lost Lydia."

Did I ever figure that wrong? My bucket was full to the point of having a hard time toting it. My face had just breached the corner of the house. It felt as if a monsoon hit me all at once. I couldn’t see anything. It felt as though my eyelids were peeled back and my hair left its home, never to return. On my knees and begging him to stop only brought more trouble. The harder I begged, the more he let me have it. I’ve been told nothing is tighter than a brother’s love. Boy did he love his younger brother. If this was his way of showing love, I believe we both would have done better fighting it out. It didn’t take long before our mother stepped in.
“You know your father will be home soon. This mess had better be cleaned up,” she said. Nobody talked back to Mama. She had our utmost respect. Our mess was cleaned up and on the back porch sat a bucket of water. I will not lie, it was mine. That was just in case he tried another sneak attack.
What is that old saying? “Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me”. I must have been the most shamed person in our family. He sure got me more than twice and I was talking about just anything.
The door opened slowly. Was he ready for a truce? Deep down my mind had second thoughts. I grabbed the bucket of water. When I turned to give a full roundhouse motion, the water had already started to leave the bucket. If only you saw the fear on my face. It was too late to stop or turn.
Our dad caught the full force of water and looked madder than a wet hen. The thing that caught me off guard was that my brother was just standing to his left about ten feet away. One of the biggest grins on his face.    I knew I was in deep trouble. Dad was soaked from his head to his waistline. All I could do was say I was so sorry. I was expecting more from him other than what he gave me. Slowly he went inside. My brother was laughing so hard. I wanted to do something. My bucket was still in my hand. The water flowed easily into it. As I turned to throw it on him, there stood our father with a bucket full of water. He looked at me and grinned. Now, I have seen that grin before.
We both nodded at the same time. My brother was soaked from head to toe. That was funny to Dad. My brother was going out on a date in less than twenty minutes. He had to change clothes and start all over again.
My dad laughed at him and said, “Don't mess with the man, who is the master of water fights.” We both laughed as he went inside. I hugged my dad and thanked him for standing by me. His only comment was: “That is what fathers do.”"

His excuse for dumping me was “I’m really busy with my studies and we are too far apart to love each other.” Well, I told myself, that’s (bull____!) because my dad is a longshoreman and he never stopped loving me and my mom when he was 3900 miles away in the middle of the Pacific with 200 tons of cargo aboard his vessel.
I can now thank Sebastian. You see after my freshman year, my mother began asking questions about what I want to do with life when I graduate school. My answer was to go to Wildwood this summer. Duh!! My mom looked at me as if I had said, “I’m joining the Hells Angel Motorcycle Gang.” Seriously! I then began by telling my mom that I had taken an art class as an elective and I had an idea. What? A T-shirt booth on the boardwalk. My father always knew I was good at art, but my mom, at that time, was busy at the nursing school. Dad wired me $2000.00, and along with my friend and business partner, Liz, and her boyfriend, Ed (real estate tycoon and lifeguard), we began my venture. Actually, Liz’s boyfriend, Ed, had an efficiency apartment he rented from his lifeguard salary and took me in to help pay the bills, so we could all save some money. My answer to my mother’s question about lodging was answered, and she felt that she could allow me to pursue my business venture since I had also answered her question (“What are you going to do with your life?”) to boot. And, so now, an entrepreneur at 16 with one year to go before college, I bursted into the fashion scene. Over the course of the winter semester’s art class, I had learned graphics and computers-assisted art design, etc. I had hardware and software that I used to scan my artwork and then have tacted for iron on printed for T-shirts. Liz and I went on a shopping spree at the dollar store and even went online to Hanes to purchase various sizes and colors of T-shirts. Liz also contacted the business association of Wildwood and beachfront stalls to lease a spot for the summer. With all systems ready to go, it was now my turn to muster up the courage to ask my art teacher to assist me with the purchase and set up of the print hardware and software. Liz’s boyfriend was on board along with his lifeguard friends to help with the moving and hauling aspects. So, with my mom’s business savvy and eye for details, she helped us with the shop’s delicate details and it was off to the races.
My dad’s investments paid off. Also, I set up a website and made flyers for the business and circulated those to high school friends, churches, the library and along the boardwalk… You name it! My junior year flew by as I filed financial aid papers and prepared for applications for grants as I continued to plan for and develop my brand and summer job at the beach. As my senior year approached, I had less time for maturing boys from the pool of lifeguards, no pun intended, as the online sales grew enormously. My mom set up a business account with the bank along with money market accounts, mutual funds, U.S. savings bonds, my debit account card in which I paid myself with a direct deposit account along with other investments. I soon had to switch my business status from sole proprietor to LLC for obvious reasons, albeit tax purposes. I was a celebrity of sorts during my senior year. Not only had I dated the hottest senior football star and team captain, Sebastian “Man Child” Cooper as a sophomore and had a stew of lifeguard friends, I also developed into an attractive young lady. Once again, something else caught my eye, but this time, it wasn’t a design on the door of a popular guy’s car I went to school with. It was my admissions application to NYU. I was accepted to begin a degree in Marketing and Fashion Design. Not to mention that I became a runner up in the Ms. Senior Fashion Show (an event in which the ticket proceeds supported the senior prom festivities), a photo op in the school newspaper, a $100.00 McDonald’s gift certificate, and a $100.00 shopping spree at Walmart. Wow! It was fun and was an opportunity to promote myself and my entrepreneurial endeavors.
The Big Apple, New York City! After graduation, I moved from Cape May, New Jersey to attend NYU, and once again, lodging became an issue. My dear old dad, the longshoreman, former midshipman and master navigator certainly would work magic with logistics to get a place so I can pursue my fashion and marketing degree.
During the fall, my dad was on a two month leave from being at sea in which he planned around assisting me make the adjustment and move into my new place. LIttle did I know that he found me a place. A graduation present of sorts… A penthouse at the top of the Trump Towers. It was close to college and adequate transportation. With my business now on a contractual basis with T-shirt sales to Nike, Planet Fitness, Macy’s and Asics Running Sport and a loan from the bank-approved based upon my assets and financial projected wealth, along with a hefty down payment from my father’s longshoreman savings, I had arrived at 19 years old going on 20. Well, my mom had asked what I wanted to do with myself during my sophomore year in high school. I told her that I wanted to go to Wildwood. I was serious! And now, I look from my perch down at the city, midtown Manhattan, the “Big Apple”, and think… I’m so focused, so busy with modeling, business, school, eating, sleeping and have little time to party or be a socialite. My life is like a dream come true, thus far. I’m proud of myself. Pat myself on the back? Why, why not.... I have to pat myself because there’s no one else to do so because it sometimes gets lonely at the top."

He kept picking things up, a fallen lamp, scattered magazines, the cushions from the upended sofa.
You bastard. I hope I never see you again. Tears streaked down her cheeks in silvery lines.
She bent and picked up one of Baby’s plush toys. It squeaked cheerily.
He turned towards her. She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand then whirled and rushed toward the kitchen.
Give me that, he demanded.
I’m just going to get my things then I’m leaving, she called back.
He didn’t answer. He followed her through the door.
She stood behind the granite counter cradling Baby to her chest.

You must be insane.
No, but you aren’t taking Baby. He mentioned to the carrier decorated with Disney character decals and the oversized pink bag on the counter. Just leave all her things here.

Baby had begun to make soft distressed noises.
Look, she said, you’re upsetting her.
He moved closer.
Stay away from me, asshole! She shrieked. She reached for the handle of the knife protruding from a wooden block.
Put Baby down.

She turned away hitching Baby up her shoulder. But he came around the counter too fast. He reached across her and grasped Baby’s leg loosely in his hand.
Let go of her, he said.
Get the fuck away from me! She screamed.
Baby began to whimper then cry. During the shoving match, Baby kicked frantically. Baby’s bag was knocked over scattering toys, food, and supplies across the slate floor.
He held her against pantry door trying to wrest Baby out of her arms. He held onto Baby’s legs with grim determination.
Let go of her, he said.
Don’t, she pleaded. Can’t you see you’re scaring her?
Baby continued to snuffle and cry.
I’m not scaring her.
Well, you’re hurting her.
I’m not hurting Baby, he insisted.
The lights flickered with the sudden clap of thunder that rattled the night darkened panes of the french doors. He worked her fisted fingers from Baby’s sweater with one hand, and with the other hand, he lifted Baby up under the shoulder. Baby screamed a high pitched cry.
She felt her fingers losing purchase and slowly being forced open one by one.
She felt Baby being taken from her.
No! she yelled as Baby slid loose.
She would keep her. Baby was hers.
She reached again for Baby. She caught Baby’s head and leaned back.
Baby shrieked in pain.
But he wouldn’t let go.
He felt Baby leaving his arms, and he pulled back hard.
Then there was abrupt silence.
This is how the story of two people ends."

I’ve learned that apologies are expressed through action over the course of time in a manner that suits each victim of the pain caused by our previous actions. We must first realize who we’ve harmed directly and indirectly, then correct that action along with all other offensive actions we’ve committed. Then, we must take measures and set goals to prevent harm in the future. We must know that each time we make such a promise, then one lets us back in, yet then again we break that promise, it becomes much harder for people to trust us. Why would they, if we have not earned it? They certainly are in no way obligated.

The week of the wedding I did not have the money to buy the rings, cheap rings at that. I had never imagined this predicament; this was not the stuff of dreams. Saturday morning, I still had not told her. We were to be married that evening. I thought of calling it off; it was the logical thing to do. Part of me knew it was all wrong while other voices whispered that his was my only chance at love, happiness, and the American Dream. When she found out, she was mad. She yelled a lot. She actually said, “I started to call the whole thing off, but you are not getting out of it that easy.”
Here is how it went; she called a friend of hers who owned a boutique who gave us a cheap pair of bands. The minister had a small church available in Georgia. He called back to find out which state we bought the license in. Since we bought it in Tennessee, it had to be performed there. The preacher said it was important to have friends there that would hold us accountable later. We had a couple on my side and a couple for her side. I had to call “my couple,” who were sitting in a restaurant watching football because of the ring delay, and redirect them. Finally, we were married in a public park. Her friend took pictures. My friend’s wife said, “Sammy, I hope the honeymoon is better planned than the wedding.” It wasn’t. We went home and watched borrowed DVDs.
The marriage wasn’t any better than the wedding. I am not sure why the relationship took the turn it did. I have my suppositions, but in the end, I think making it official raised the stakes. We had an even harder time getting along. She turned violent and I eventually responded in violence. The divorce was the longest part of the marriage.
I am not trying to blame her or run her down. I am being as honest as I know how to. The fact is that we stood under the blue sky and bright sun with our closest friends at our side, respectively, and made oaths to our God. They sounded good at the time; better or worse, sickness or health. We were both sick. We walked in eyes wide open and without a clue what these things would look like; sickness, health, better, worse. I have heard it said “it is better not to promise God anything than to promise and not fulfill it.” I agree."

Fid: What’s a rock?
BC: That thing stopping you from pushing me. I surely thought dogs were smart.
Fid: Well, I’ve been trying to get past that thing you call a rock. Why do you want to go to the lake anyway?

BC: What the duck?
Fid: I think we’re being followed by our house!
BC: Why do you say that?
Fid: Look! It’s over there behind that tree in our front yard.
BC: Now we’ll never be able to tell how far the lake is.
Fid: Well, you hatched this idea.
BC: At least I got to see the other side of that tree over there.
Fid: I think I heard a can opener! We better get back before dinner time.

Wow! As if we needed another reason to lose our gut? Are you ready to get serious about losing weight? Ready to do the hard work necessary? If you’re not 100% committed, go back to your honey bun. If you are, keep reading.
The good news is we’ve already done the hardest part: come to prison. Believe it or not, prison is the best place we could have to truly shock our system and change our diet habits. We lack the luxury of choices. We’re on a forced diet - we have to make an effort (and spend money) to reach the calorie intake an average American consumes daily. The seemingly tiny portions and bland food served by the state and federal prison sysetms will not kill us (contrary to popular belief) and does provide just enough nutrition and calories to sustain life - and coincidentally the ideal amount to spur significant weight loss (for those close to the obese marker on the Body Mass Index).
Part 1 of your weight loss program was 5 steps:

Empty your box of all food and drinks. Stop buying any.
Eat all and only state food:
All 3 meals
No bread
No processed sugar - trade those cookies for extra veggies or fruit.
Drink plenty of water - shoot for half of your body weight in ounces.
Light exercise
Walk/run/play sports at yard and gym 3 times a week
Basic body weight exercises 3 times a week
Sleep; steady, consistent, 7-9 hours a day
Watch the pounds melt off - up to 20 lbs in your first month (depending on your starting weight)

Part 2: Keeping it off. Like recidivism, most folks will regain all of the lost weight within 6 months. Keeping the weight off is actually the hardest part of any weight loss strategy (and yet most diets don’t account for it). Follow these steps to assure your success:

Identify all the truly healthy items on your canteen/commissary list.
Read nutritional labels, pay close attention to serving size; fat, sugar, sodium, carbs, and calorie content versus protein and fiber content). [Spoiler alert: oatmeal, peanut butter, and cereal aren't as good for you as you may think]
Only shop from this approved list
Create and keep a diet journal. Plan and track everything we eat and drink daily.
Water is best for us, but we can start drinking tea and coffee (no sugar, but milk is okay). Absolutely no pop/soda or Kool-Aid.
Begin a consistent weight training and cardio regimen 3 times a week each.
Never eat after 7pm. Never.
Eat all meals within a 12 hour window (if possible)
Always eat breakfast, the bigger the better/
Take available supplements or vitamins (the science is still out, but hey, it’s a cheap insurance policy). Take with food.
Reward/cheat meals and snacks from our healthy diet list can be incorporated into our diet when we skip a chow, celebrate a milestone, or merely need something different. No more than 3 times a week.
Grow a bigger dick.

This effort is by no means easy, but nothing worthwhile is. We’re not only building better, healthier, habits we’re also building character, self-control, and self-esteem. Congrats, if you’ve made it, you’re a better, thinner, healthier man… with a huge cock."

Conditions were even worse in Europe, particularly in Germany, where they were still paying reparations to the winners of World War One. Hitler had the same answers as Roosevelt, but he had his workers making weapons too. He won his fight against the parasite classes who lived off the interest from their money, or lived by being price gouging merchants or middlemen. Then he bloated-up his military to steal back what had been taken during the war and more. My parents fought and survived this new world war that put everyone back to work, killing each other. When it was over, the survivors had plenty of money to spend. Trillions of dollars at the bottom of the economic pyramid did what it has always done throughout history: It trickled up to the rich again. Everyone prospered until 1970, which is when the rich began to get too greedy. They raised prices, cut wages, and began again the cycle that leads to another worldwide worker ripoff like the one that was so destructive to the lives of my parents."

Why would I be on the chain? I silently asked myself. My groggy brain refused to give me an answer so I kicked off my sheet and packed my property. Despite his gung ho attitude of earlier, several hours passed before the guard returned.
“Come on with that property.” He jammed the pry bar into the tray slot released mechanism and popped the slot open. The tray slot was used to pass meals through – thus the name “tray slot” – but also used as a way to handcuff dangerous prisoners in a safe manner for the guards. I was labeled as one of those dangerous prisoners.
“Where am I going?”
“I don’t know,” he said.
“Yeah you do,” I argued. “The chain list says where I am going.”
“Yours don’t.”
“You’re lying.” I plopped down on my bunk. “I’m not moving until I know what’s going on.”
Call me paranoid or crazy even, but after years of being a high ranking gang member involved in all sorts of no-good, I was leery about taking an unexpected bus ride.
The guard tied of the conversation and clicked the handcuffs open. “Submit to hand restraints.”
“No.”
“Don’t make me call rank,” he warned.
“Tell me where I am going.”
He took a deep breath and exhaled loudly. “Something’s squirrelly,” he said. “The list doesn’t say where you’re going.”
I crossed my arms across my tattooed chest and remained silent.
“Look,” the guard tried, “I’ll find out what I can but I’m not promising anything.”
“Cool,” I answered. “Don’t mess me over.”
He didn’t.
“You’re on a special chain for McConnell.”
McConnell Unit? Why was I going there? I didn’t want to leave Connally. Although the Connally Unit was declared one of the most violent prisons in the state, I enjoyed the place. It was home even though it wasn’t always the best place to be.
The administration decided it wouldn’t be my home anymore.
“Smith!” a stocky guard called me as the bus pulled up at McConnell’s gate house.
“Yeah?”
“Get in the cage.” He jabbed a finger at a small fenced area.
“I’m supposed to be staying here?” I replied.
He shook his head.
“Where am I going?” I stepped into the cage.
“Don’t know.” He slammed the doors hut and snapped a brass lock on my cage. “And really don’t care.” He walked away.
“You’ll care in a minute.” I yelled at his gray-shirted back. “Get me some rank or bring the team!” (S.O.R.T. Team – Special Operations Response Team – is a group of five guards wearing riot gear. They deal with unruly prisoners in an unruly manner.)
The guard stormed off. Five minutes later a sergeant came to my cage. I knew him as a guard on Connally before he received his rank.
“Smith,” he said. “Why are you tripping?”
“I just want to know where I’m going.”
“That’s it?” he asked. “Give me a minute.”
When he returned I knew something was amiss. The sergeant was smiling! My stomach twisted in anticipation. Smiling sergeants usually meant bad news to me.
“What’s up?” I waited, uncertain if I really wanted to hear the answer.
“How long you been in seg?”
“Thirteen years.”
He nodded. “It’s over.”
“Huh?”
He smiled wider, if that was even possible. “A special van’s coming to support you to the Ramsey Unit. You’re getting released from seg.”
I was getting out of seg! I couldn’t believe it. After almost thirteen years of solitary confinement I was going to be free. True I’d remained imprisoned, and even take a vocational trade. More importantly, I could hug my parents after years of physical isolation.
I couldn’t believe this was really happening. What began as a journey of despair had morphed into the grandest dream. This road trip would be the beginning of a new lifetime – a life of hope, happiness, and achievement.
This unexpected blessing would be a never-ending journey of re-discovering who I was meant to be.
This road trip was awesome!"

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bam, bam, bam! The woman is running now. The terrorists run for their vehicles. Some chase her on foot. They all shoot at her. She zigzags and runs behind a building. She sweats. Her hair is wild. Her breath is fast. She runs.
The vehicles are coming. She hears their engines. Sees their lights behind her. Shadows drive around her. An abandoned building to her right. She jumps a dusty puddle and hurries inside, up a dark set of stairs to the second and then third floor. The trucks outside are everywhere. She hears more shooting. Random shooting. She reaches the roof of the building through a hole where a door once was. From a shadow she watches the terrorists. With her phone she streams them live.
Boom! An explosion in the lower levels of the building she is in. A grenade. Voices shouting. Footsteps on the stairs. There is nowhere else to go. The woman looks about for an escape route. She turns the phone on herself.
“My family, my friends, I love you all. They are coming up. I have no escape. I love you. I will film them when they come for me. The whole world can see their evil.” She does not cry as she turns the phone towards the stairs.
“Bitch! Drop the phone! Drop the phone!” the masked terrorist screams.
The others with him say nothing. They rush her. Hate in their eyes.
I am very fast. I can jump very high, and I have many weapons. When I land in front of the woman, who has been the light I’ve been following, she recoils with surprise. The terrorists look shocked for that brief moment before they became dead.
I am fast. All the terrorist in the building die in a flash. The ones outside in the trucks stop breathing just as quickly. Then I go back up.
I am very strong. Within minutes the woman and I are out of the city. I carry her with ease.
When the helicopter comes out of the sky the woman speaks. “What are you? What are you?” she asks.
She is pretty. Her face is dirty. Her hair is messed up. I reply, “Something new.” I grin."

Me: Gulping. Thanks, I hate vodka, but any port in a storm.
Bartender: Smiles
Me: I would like another low-volume, high alcohol content drink.
I would drink through several pink drinks, a few green drinks, some black substance, and finish up with vodka, Kahlua and tonic over layers of slivered ice. I would get wasted and collapse in my cabin until the next morning and spend each day pleasantly numbed from a series of tropical rum drinks that take the edge off of my clanging inner ear. No one minded much because I am a happy drunk. Really, I tried everything, but nothing the doctors prescribed or the acupuncturist did help me with nausea.
Being incarcerated, I have extremely limited opportunities to ride in vehicles. I only go where my feet carry me. I am disgustingly healthy. However last year, I developed a stone in my salivary gland. It swelled until I looked as if an alien were trying to hatch from my jaw. It was extremely painful. Surgery was the only option, which would require a “road trip” to the hospital. I am a high custody inmate so taking me out of the prison is an event for the officers and an ordeal for me. I have to be black-boxed on the wrists, chained at the waist and hobbled. Sigh... all quite unnecessary if you ask me.
I had not been on a medical trip for a very long time. Somehow the sheet detailing my motion sickness problem was missing from the file. Therefore, I did not get any medication and the officers would not give me a little bag. You cannot refuse a medical trip for any reason. To do so would be to refuse the treatment, and in my case the surgery. Did I mention the pain? I had been suffering for months. Additionally, because the van with seats facing forward was in for repairs, I had to be driven in the “dog cart.” The dog-cart is a van with no windows and is essentially a steel box with metal benches along the sides. Fabulous. I would be riding sideways in a box with no windows.
I remarked to Sergeant as I got on the van that I suffered from motion sickness and that she might want to get me a trash bag. Even though she had known me for a long time, the request was ignored. Sadly for everyone, there was another inmate in the van with me.
Sergeant drove like she was in a demolition derby. This is probably the way everyone drives in Miami and what followed was inevitable. There was no air conditioning and the heat was oppressive. All I can say is three-quarters of the way into the trip, Mount Vesuvius erupted and covered everything. There was no way I could be taken out of the van in that condition and it continued, violently, all the way back to the prison.
The van pulled in between the two gates and the officers leaped out of the van immediately. Inmate medical orderlies dressed in paper suits and armed with hoses and scrub brooms were standing by. Of course, I let the other inmate go out first, she was the real victim. Then I sort of rolled out of the van and lay on the burning asphalt while I was hosed off with the sprayer. I couldn’t get up for twenty minutes.
A month eventually passed and I still needed surgery. The prison doctor scheduled me for another appointment. This time, I was sequestered in the infirmary the night before. I was dosed with Dramamine and in the morning received two more mystery injections. Within the hour, all was pleasant in the world and everything took on a beautiful, hazy glow. The sergeant showed up with all of my steel accouterments and wound them around me. I was louche and relaxed, sort of like being on a cruise ship. I practically had to be poured in a pitcher and carried out to the back gate. This time I got chained in the front cage with windows.
The maxillofacial surgeon was tall and handsome. How lucky I was to get a sexy and young instead of bitter and curmudgeonly surgeon. As he prepared for the surgery, he explained I would receive another injection of...something wonderful which was fine by me. I didn’t even flinch or have any desire to bite him when he probed painfully around my mouth. He cut under my tongue, pulled out something disgusting and dropped it in a specimen cup. As he was cauterizing the underside of my tongue, wisps of smoke drifted out and I stared into his dreamy brown eyes and thought...well, I fell asleep.
The sergeant woke me and asked if I was ready to go back. I slurred, “home James,” and I walked out tilting slightly to the side with an officer propping me up on the right. The trip back was uneventful, but of course, I sang a few bars of “Show Me the Way to Go Home” before sleeping through the rest of the trip back to prison. I didn’t even get to enjoy looking out the window. So much for my latest road trip. I don’t think they are going to be in a hurry to take me anywhere for a long time, but Sergeant sings pretty good harmony."

For the past year I’ve studied civil law in order to right the wrongs done against me. Three months ago I filed my very first “1983” and to be honest, I’ve never been more intimidated by anything else In my life. Not because I don’t understand the things I’ve taught myself over the past year, but because as anyone knows that has been down this road, It’s a little bit tricky.
I am doing the best I can at this point because for once in my life I’m in the right. Lucky for me there was a camera that caught the whole incident on tape, but I still feel intimidated because what if I mess up? The court creates traps for people like us in an attempt to take our voice from us. It’s the trickiest business in our land. So I stay in the law books I’ve obtained in order to give me the confidence I need to do this. I’m far from a dummy and at the end of the day, I’ll win this fight. I have to.
I look at it like this, the only way to bring about change within our lives is to educate ourselves so that when we are faced with a “tricky” situation, we can face It head on and prevail against all odds. At times we are surrounded by enemies because of the life we choose to live, but we don’t have to be victims any longer.
I’ve become a staunch advocate of the small rights we have. I’ve got that fire within me now and even though I know the road ahead of me will be “tricky” at times, I have truth on my side and at the end of the day, the truth will always come to light. So wish me luck everybody."

""I'm sure your interview will go smoothly, Doctor.” The woman hung up.
Peter sat still for a moment. So they thought he was over the hill, too old to play the game, did they? He might be pushing eighty-five but he was still a player. He felt the lining of his jacket pocket for the tiny notebook containing quotes he wanted to mention to the reviewer. Good, it was still there. Picking up the newspaper on the table he opened it and disappeared into the details of the city hall's latest scandal.
She cleared her throat, a real phlegm rattler. That's what woke the old man. His head had fallen forward over his chest. He blinked, disoriented, at the young woman sitting at his table. She wore an elegant black suit with a long sheer scarf tied loosely at the shoulder.
""Dr. Guzmann?” she inquired. ""Dr. Peter Guzmann?”
“Yes,"" he mumbled, sitting up straighter. He felt refreshed and the feeling of impatience he had wrestled with disappeared. He wondered how long she had been sitting there.
""I'm Miranda, I'll be taking you upstairs for your review. Would you like something to drink? Can I freshen up your coffee before we leave?""
Peter looked at the thick yellow cup in front of him. He couldn't remember finishing it. ""No need, no need at all. I'd rather just get down to the reason for our meeting today, Miss. I hope you read my new book.”
“Yes, I have. Please, call me Miranda.”
Dr. Guzmann and Miranda entered an old fashioned elevator. The cage was constructed of ornate ironwork with gold filigreed designs etched in the metal. The door slid open and the two stepped into a reception area decorated in gold Louis the XIV furnishings and blue Persian rugs.
“Is it possible for Dr. Guzmann to be reviewed now?"" Miranda asked the receptionist, a golden-haired young man in an impossibly loud and gaudy plaid suit. The suit was so garish Peter had to squint just to make out the man's bright outline.
""Let me ask if everything is ready,"" the man rose smoothly and departed through a chased silver door.
Soon he returned. ""Everything is set up, fifth door on the right.”
""Oh,"" Miranda sighed, “that's a good room.” She proceeded down the hall and opened the door on the right.
They entered and Miranda walked over to the rosewood casket. The top portion lay open to reveal the head and shoulders of the deceased. Peter vaguely recognized the man reposing in the satin-lined interior. The head was balding, wrinkles pouched under the eyes. On his lips was a hint of a smile. Peter stood looking down on the man but feeling neither sad nor frightened. He wondered if he was there to identify him.
The door to the room opened again and a woman resembling a younger version of his first wife Claire glided in. ""Impossible! It must be my wife's niece,"" Peter whispered. He stepped to the side as the woman approached the casket. He reached into a pocket for the clean handkerchief he always carried. She stood over the casket looking down. No special emotion showed on her face. Then she turned to Peter regarding him for a moment with an expression of faint surprise.
After a few seconds she turned to Miranda, “Yes, it's him.”
""Are you alright my dear,"" Peter asked. He wasn't sure if she would recognize him. “My name is Peter, was married to your aunt Claire. Were you close to this gentleman?”
The woman regarded him seeming to think for a minute. Then she said, “You’ve made a mistake.”
“A mistake, don't you know who this gentleman is?""
Her eyebrow slowly rose, ""Don't you know this is Peter Guzmann? He died just yesterday.”
Peter tried to smile. “Don’t be ridiculous. It’s probably another man who looks like me. Maybe it's another Peter Guzmann entirely,” but the second he said the words he knew it was true. He was dead. Oddly, he felt nothing. The woman speaking to him was his wife, Claire, deceased for two years. He'd realized if he were alive he would be feeling something, happiness at seeing her, shock at his own death. Only someone who was beyond feeling could remain so detached at seeing his own body, a lifeless shell, lying before him.
He tried to laugh but failed. The body and casket faded leaving Miranda and Claire standing on either side of him. Miranda unfurled her scarf and draped it over her dark hair and across her shoulders as a gentle mist filled the room.
""How did this happen? I was sitting in the CuppaJoe perfectly fit this morning waiting to meet the reviewer about my new book!”
""It wasn't this morning,” Miranda replied gently, ""and you weren't very fit."" She tapped him on the breast pocket of his jacket. “Too many bacon burgers.”
""I had a heart attack?""
""Probably,"" Miranda nodded.
In the cemetery, it was still and peaceful. A man with a long light-brown ponytail and a crisp collared shirt gave a brief review of Peter's life. “He was an intellectual in the best sense of the word. When Peter Guzmann came to America, he worked all day and night while attending college, graduating with the highest honors. True, he had some difficulties and both professional and personal disappointments. Almost every theory he had about God and life and death caused controversy, but he remained a scholar of the deepest integrity.”
""Those are quotes from my notebook,"" Peter exclaimed as he patted his jacket pocket. Of course the little notebook had been removed much earlier. “I’ve never even met this man,"" he grumbled, ""and I'm not protestant, I'm an atheist! Is this all they've got to say about me? Who arranged this funeral anyway?""
“Your children hired him and gave him some of your books,” Miranda said.
Peter looked behind himself at the grieving faces of Peter, Jr. Sonja and Helena, sitting on the first row.
“Who’s the woman with the blonde hair on the third bench?"" Claire asked.
""Oh, aham..... my second wife, Gladys.”
“Gladys, your secretary? I always thought something was going on!"" Claire wrenched her hand from Peter's.
“I’ve had enough, let's get out of here,"" muttered Peter.
Miranda pulled the gauzy black scarf across her pale face making the sheer fabric into a sort of veil. “Where would you liked to go?”
The preacher finished his eulogy and the scattered mourners sang a half-hearted rendition of Amazing Grace. Miranda lightly touched Peter and Claire on the shoulders. They floated out of the cemetery to the street. Miranda lit next to a gleaming white marble bench engraved with the words bus stop.
Peter sat down and looked at the pedestrians passing by a row of shops. Cars honked loudly as they whizzed past on the street. “Is this what death is like? Same city, same streets, same stores? Even I seem the same.”
""Yep, but without a body,” Claire held up a transparent hand as she looked through her palm at him.
“So what are we supposed to do now?"" asked Peter.
“Really, I don't know what to tell you,” responded Miranda as she peered over the edge of her veil. ""Are you hungry, thirsty, or tired?""
Claire and Peter looked at each other. ""No, nothing.”
""This is unbelievable! Crazy! Insane! The most ridiculous superstitions mankind has about dying are true,” said Peter.
""Maybe there is a hell or a heaven?"" Claire asked uncertainly. “Should we expect an appearance from the Grim Reaper?"" She glanced around the busy sidewalk.
""Anything is possible at this point,"" Peter sighed. ""What's your role in all of this, Miranda?""
A blue and silver bus circled down from the sky and settled next to the bus stop. Miranda smiled, “I think your connection is here.”
“Yes, what are you here for?"" Claire asked.
Miranda stood up with the couple and pushed them gently toward the bus door. Peter and Claire turned back briefly. Miranda extended her slim hands to each of them and solemnly shook their hands. ""I'm the Grim Greeter, I don't reap anymore, but I do stop by and say to everyone who has ever lived, 'nice try’.
""After you my dear,"" Peter said gallantly, taking Claire's astral arm as they climbed aboard the bus that had no destination listed on its message board.
""Where do you think we're going?” she asked in a worried voice.
They took seats in the middle and looked out the window at the tiny city below them, the earth and all its rivers, oceans and continents spread underneath them. They could see the whole universe, then everything became completely clear.
""Did you say something?"" Claire asked.
Peter answered; “I’m glad I have been wrong my whole life.”"

While she picked up a brick and examined it, I examined her. She looked just like Sharon, only older, with a more modest taste in clothes and sensibly short hair. “These are all hundreds? My oh my!” She managed to sound worried and gratified at the same time. “That white bag? Is that…?”
“Yes,” I continued.
“Throw it away!”
“I’ll take care of it.” It looked to be about four ounces, worth about $20,000 if a guy tried to retail it. If all the bricks were hundreds, as I suspected they were, then this was worth about half a million dollars. There was no excuse for it, and I’d expected more of John, at least until I saw the pigs on the news, hauling off his estate cars. What a waste! I told her my estimate of the total. She gasped. “So, what’s your plan?” I asked, knowing that it would be a bad one.
“Why, to get my daughter out of that awful place right away!”
This poor woman should have known better, but she’d been hamstrung by the church crowd, who all thought that God made the plans for them. This is like driving with your eyes closed. Soon as she tried to pay Sharon’s bond, the courthouse crew would smell the money, kidnap her into their jail and browbeat it all out of her in only a few hours, if that. And she’d tell them about me, too. It would have been better for everyone if I stayed. I’d have to mortgage her house, build at least two stashes for the money, explain to her how the judicial system really works, get Sharon out, find out who was the real fix-it lawyer, get the laundry operation going…
“Margie?” I began.
“Yes?”
“It’s going to be a little harder than that.”
“I can’t leave her in there! What else can I do?”
I offered to stay and help and Margie gratefully accepted, even though she barely knew my name. We moved the kids into the back seat to make room for my bike. We made it inside her garage while it was still dark, without any cops seeming to notice. It was almost a month before I could get back to Albuquerque. The return trip wasn’t nearly as taxing. The bike sat on the bumper of a Ford van that had been made for comfortable road trips.
Steven P. Arthur
The sweltering California summer heat was overwhelming as a gracefully aging Chevrolet drove us to the cool pacific ocean. Our little family of four had made this trip many times, but this trip would be the best and most memorable for me.
We took the familiar back-highway route, a secret known only to valley residences, or so we like to tell ourselves. These back-highways, encroached by dirt, zig-zag through thousands of acres of farmland irrigated by the California water canal system that runs parallel to miles of the highway.
We were more than halfway to our destination. The low rolling, sunburnt hills of the valley were mostly in the rearview mirror and we had just passed a large green sign announcing that we had entered a new city. However, after some time the old Chevrolet gave up the “ghost”, or in the mechanic’s jargon, “threw a main bearing.”
Living in the age of cellular communication does, on occasion, show its superiority as it did that day. My wife of seven years called for a tow while I informed the two wild animals, who carried a combination of my wife and I’s genes, that the beach trip might not happen. Needless to say, they were not happy about the development. My girl, who unfortunately for her, carries a striking resemblance to me, somehow developed the same look on her face as when she is waiting for the punchline of a joke. At only six-years-old going on sixteen, she could be more than slightly intimidating. On the other hand, my son, at the ripe old age of four, just wanted to play video games and didn't care where.
The ride in the tow truck was rough and slow. We were on smooth asphalt, but by the way the truck shook and lurched, we could have been on a dirt road peppered with potholes. The kids loved it.
The tow driver was a cordial and chatty fellow in beat-up coveralls with a Santa Claus type of stomach that pushed the limits of his buttons. We finally arrived in a nameless and forgettable little town composed of eight buildings, with the newest being a Chevron gas station. At last, he dropped us off at a motel.
After a brief encounter with the motel desk clerk with the Norman Bates vibe, we found ourselves in a basic room. The amenities included four walls and a heavy duty door with multiple locks. Nothing more. The television had two and a half channels, no cable or internet service.
That night we were all huddled together, simply talking and sharing stories of mostly the fictional sort. My wife and I talked to the kids about our childhood and that segwayed into card games of Go Fish, Old Maid and original games of our own. We laughed and talked well into the night. No computers, phones, internet or games. Just the four of us spending time together, much like the way my wife and I had spent with our parents at that age. It was the best vacation ever."

I downed another gulp of minty mocha on that thought. Adam’s smile lit up when he noticed me and ran to the car.
He opened the door with “Hey mom, I didn’t know I had to go back to the doctor already. My new inhaler’s been working fine.”
He hopped into the passenger seat, and I gave him a playful pinch as he buckled his seatbelt.
“Well son, I may have told a little fib just to get you out of school..and if you can keep it a secret, I am willing to offer you a bribe.”
He looked up curiously.
I continued, “All-you-can-eat pizza, an IMAX 3D movie, then maybe froyo and a trip to the science museum. Deal?”
That definitely got his attention.
“Seriously?”
Now I was reeling him in.
“For sure.”
I gave him my most immaculately persuasive smile.
“Sweet! What’s the occasion? You sell another house? My friends are always saying how hot you look on your new realtor billboards...it’s really getting annoying.”
So I was the hot mom now!? The schnapps had me giggling and blushing inside, but I had to focus and close the deal.
“There’s no real occasion Add...I guess I just..missed you. We can dub today Awesome Son Appreciation Day, if you want to jazz it up a bit.”
That did it. His smile was broad and bright now.
“Works for me mom! Can I get some new comics too!?”
Those were reasonable closing costs.
“Done!”
I left the school lot feeling relieved. Adam had already turned back to the color-splashed pages of his epic superhero battles. Out on the main highway, as I passed one of my apparently “popular” realty company billboards, I felt a squirrely wind gust push against my Rogue - weird, why did it make me think of Matt again. He was out and about in the free world somewhere, but what was his motive now? I hoped and prayed it wasn’t me.

Her indigo-tinged hair, Sapphira’s hair, was elongated and elegantly arrayed across her nakedness. She looked to Sapphira, sobbing and outstretching her colorless arms to reveal seeping scarlet lines. A burgundy murk then spilled over the tub, and across the forest floor, and splayed out onto the tracks in a gushing flow. The rail cart continued onward amid the goopy flood.
Sapphira tried to preoccupy herself – tracing the cherry slashes in the beige of her own arms, brooding then regretting. Why had she done it?
Without warning, a subtle vibration made Sapphira’s head swivel behind her. She was no longer alone, but as to what was now in her company… she had no feasible clue. Structurally, it was a lanky and skeletal being. Its integument was translucent and reflective like glass, and its innards were moving swaths of a sparkling force unknown to rational human perception. It raised its hefty hands and, as the cart propelled forward, the crimson tide began ebbing away.
Before Sapphira could consider leaping down onto the reemerging tracks, and feeling, a consortium of murmurings formed in her mind and composed into a warm human tone.
“Hello Sapphira” it resounded.
Sapphira nervously signed her response, “H-Hello? Where Am I?”
The soothing vocal amalgamation continued, “Unfortunately, beloved, we cannot sufficiently answer your query without revealing the unmitigated design of the entire universe. More importantly, it is not this setting which should concern you. The imperative question is… where do you wish to go?”
Sapphira measured her thoughts, exhaled remorse, and gesticulated her communication sincerely, “I was just tired really. Tired of it all… the world… wanting to hear… to belong… searching. All I ever truly wanted -- needed… was acceptance… love-- peace. Take me there. At that moment, a rift of dazzling intensity materialized just ahead of them.
The being pointed forward, “Then, that is where we shall proceed. Be not vexed by your transgression. We know what dwells within your innermost moral fibers. You are now absolved and unbound. Be both cheerful and comforted beloved… for the beautiful embrace of your eternity awaits.”
Sapphira reclined in serenity, free, bowing her lips into a genuinely joyous smile."

But I moved back here to NC after two short years because my little sister needed me.
Upon returning to NC. Paul and I began to develop business partnerships. I started up two computer repair companies-ASAP and Gaston Technology through the years. He hooked me up some domain space on his web server since he’d already done web development with network solutions. So I started developing websites for my clients.
We kept a consistent dialogue on the rapidly growing computer tech industry. It was hard for me to keep up. We had business accounts with Sprint for years until he got fed up with them and we moved on to Verizon. Often I would seek his expertise on computer related issues and occasionally he’d send me a repair job.
My good friend and mentor Paul is definitely, without a doubt, the best business partner I ever had. He is an honest, noble, man of God who I trust and I am truly grateful for him. Now he comes to the tricky part.
One day I stumbled into a deal with one of niy ASAP partners who need me to host a router or server-some physical networking hardware-on my network. The job seemed simple enough, the only problem was that they rewired a Time Warner Cable Connection. I had a charter.
The awesome thing about this deal was that the partner would pay the entire bill for hosting their hardware. As much as I wanted this deal for myself, I just couldn’t get TWC in my area. I mean, who wouldn't want their cable, internet and phone bill paid each month. That’s nearly $1,500 a year in savings at 120$ a month, which is about what my charter business bundle cost back then.
So as a token of my appreciation and gratitude for all the good business and kindness he’d shown me over the years. I gave that deal to my great and awe -inspiring mentor Paul. He was, no doubt, more qualified than me anyways. But, in all this, I’ve learned a little secret to life called the “Boomerang principle.”
Wrapped up inside this principle It states, “Give and it will be given unto you. Good measure, pressed down, shared together, running over will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.”(Saint Luke) give, and like a boomerang: It comes back to you.
Paul my PALS mentor - has not forgotten about me in my incarceration either. He regularly responds with me by mail and he loyally provides the funds for most of my canteen purchases. And for this Tricky Business I am in, I am truly and forever grateful anyhow."

You really have a rhythm for the music. So you like the blues.”
“Oh yes, who wouldn’t enjoy the sound of all the instruments bringing the temp on time. It sounds like you have studied music in the past.”
“Excuse me Mr. Tyrone. Here is the drink you ordered.”
“Bring the lady what she wants. Sparkling water for me please.”
“Yes ma’am.”
The waiter left to return with the glass of preferred drink. She thanked him and he returned to his duties.
“Mr. Tyrone,” she said,'' What is it that I can help you with? I do enjoy the music and being here. Most of all it is where I can be myself. Not everyone has the rhythm.”
“What is your name?” he asked.
“ My name is Shondra. My mother named me after her auntie.”
“That is so wonderful. My name is Tyrone Williams. I own the club and presently I am looking for a singer. One who can bring in a crowd and bring the house down. How would you like to try for a chance to have a career? The pay isn't much to start with. I believe you have what it takes to make it happen.”
“Can I think about it this weekend? By at least next Friday, I can give you an answer. I would feel more relaxed if not pushed into it too fast.”
“Then, Shondra, can we have a small sample of your voice? I don’t see why not.” She got up from her chair. The stage was less than 20 feet. Tyrone motioned for the bartender to have the band set up. Once Shondra was on stage, she turned to the band. With a count of three, the music started to play. Out of her mouth flowed the slow sweetest sound of soul you would ever want to hear. The bartender was wiping his eyes. Tyrone was whimpering like a baby. For once in his life, her voice tore deep into the soul. The men at the bar were shedding tears. One man had to leave; he was so touched that he left a ten spot (ten dollars) in a mason jar for the singer.
Once she had finished the song she headed back to the table. Tyrone was still wiping his eyes. The men in the band were clapping their hands in approval.
Tyrone pulled her chair out to seat her.
“You're the best this place could offer as a singer,” he said.
“You’re just being kind.” she said. “I’m not that good.”
“ Look around you and see for yourself.” Slowly the clapping subsided.
Shondra sat with her left hand under her. She had such an incredible voice. Tyrone sat waiting for an answer. He had seen a soul singer who could rock the house of blues. She not only would bring in a profit, it would also help launch her career. Shondra not only accepted his offer, she went home that night a hundred dollars richer from the mason jar. Tyrone had agreed to pay no less than 250 for the first weekend plus tips in the jar.
Her career was heading up since not only because of Tyrone. A young man who sat in the audience in the audience on blues night gave her his card for the real House of Blues."

Melendez,,No,2015.0,11 - November,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Woman-in-Black-576d14a63c184a8aa3074dcaa35d574e,Allaire Tetrault,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_kO7qhHSd_PbGPSW9q4ItscgOyE-kaQ11DA1uzgWS8/edit,No,"“Death has no fingerprints?” he states both as a statement and in question. He pauses to study the garments that Death is wearing. She’s wearing a shawl over her head and her face is covered by what can only be described as a thin fabric sort of ski mask. But unlike a ski mask, only part of her nose is exposed. A loose all-black fitting robe covered her entire body.
“Death, you’re a woman?” he asks after his observations of Death’s dark veiled attire. She laughs at him. What a question. She can almost see the wheels turning in his head about to try and conquer Death’s heart.
“I’m not Death, but you will die by my hands,” she says.
He gives her a look of confusion. He makes an effort to move but it’s in vain. All that he manages to move around his his head.
“Who are you?!” he says in shock and very much feeling like a fool. “I can’t move,” he cries out. How did he get here, he wonders. His thoughts were hazy as if he were coming off a drug.
She lets out another laugh and looks down at his terrified face. Her laugh was a roaring loud and it amplified his fear. He continues thinking that his had to be Death. He was trembling now.
In brief, Rebekah, “Death,” had gotten into his house while he laid in bed passed out drunk. She injected him with a syringe full of a drug that would keep him paralyzed from the neck down for as long as she need him to be.
He was helpless now. It’s her turn to be in control, his grip on her shattered heart was over with.
The man made every effort to move but it was pointless. All his attempts only frustrated him and filled him with more panic.
“You will die with a broken heart,” she tells him while placing her hand on his chest.
“Why are you doing this, who are you?” he asks pitifully. She doesn’t answer. The soon to be dead man simply starts shouting insults at her. Not a single disparaging word is spared. His mouth was a machine gun of insults.
His anger and frustration excited her. Every word was fuel for her need to end his life.
“Tell me more my darling,” she yelled over him, “I love your pain and want your hate.” Another laugh Rebekah’s vision turned red. It was like looking through blood coated eyes. It all started playing back in her mind. The way he manipulated her into loving him, knowing damn well that he had no intention on loving her in return.
“I was fooled,” she thought to herself, “lured into a trap of heartbreak.”
The men she fell in love with always managed to possess her mind. She was no angel and they liked that. They would channel her indecencies, daringness, and wicked thoughts. Unable to do it on her own, this made her love the men that dug deep and discovered her hidden malevolence. But they would leave her when her love interfered with her appetite for evil. The heartbreak would tear her world apart and completely collapse her mind into a state of pure hate. Then another man would come and tune into her bad ways. The heartache would be buried under yet another short lived love. Once more indulging in the sinful life. The life where sin was the sustenance of her love.
Until enough was enough. A heart can only be broken so many times. It was with this man that now laid bare and immobilized before her that she’d decided to master her cruel nature.
It took her some time to finally get to him. There was a long list of men that she first had to get to. To show them that she alone could conduct her wickedness without the need of their manipulations.
But it was him, the coward before her trembling, that led her to define what love truly was. Love was needy and self serving; a sacrifice of one’s secret needs. Love forfeits a person’s independence as well, because you have to surrender to someone. Therefore, love is self-defeat, a slavery of emotions and feelings.
Love, Rebekah though, was what had gotten them both where they were at now. Love can bring forth agony; you fall in love, you fall.
“Let me go..,” she managed to hear him say as she drifted in her thoughts.
“Shh... I’m gonna break your heart,” she calmly tells him.
Love and hate both baited her madness. Warm thoughts of being in love and painful memories from love played tug-o-war with Rebekah’s emotions. She felt confused. The rage rose and ceased. Insanity was taking over her and in that cloudy state she heard him say, “Rebekah, is that you?”    The sound of her name being spoken by him gave her those love feelings that she needed and hated. The butterflies in the stomach, the skip of a heartbeat, or the accelerated breathing. He knew it was her in Death’s robe, he knew her.
“Enough!” she yelled at herself. Fury came back. She reached for the long, newly sharpened knife she’d brought with her. The victim was laid out on the floor, pillows under his upper back to elevate his chest for better cutting. She holds the knife tightly with both hands high above her head.
“Nooo, please Rebekah!” he yelled. That feeling of love came again when she heard her name.
“I love you,” she told him with the sweetest voice and truly sincere. Then with one swift and quick move she brought down the knife and stabbed her lover. It easily sunk into his chest, it tore through his skin and found his shocked heart. She repeated the stabbing over and over several times, digging deeper into him. She was breaking and tearing his heart apart. Blood splattered out of the man like a sprinkler and soaked Death’s clothes to a drench.
She saw his mouth moving but didn’t hear what he was saying. He was screaming for her to stop.
The feeling she got as she “broke his heart” was overpowering. She was dizzy with excitement. Until her arms grew sore and tired.
Staring at the gaping wound in her victim she reached into it. His heart was completely torn. Decimated.
She loved that broken heart though. Rebekah picked up her dead lover and held him close to her as blood leaked out of him and pooled around her.
After every kill, every “heartbreak” love seemed possible again. She had not entirely given up on the kind of love that every woman wanted.
But just in case her clothes of Death and sharpened knife was always there if any man went and broke her heart again."

I've never smoked cigarettes. Even with the junk food, I keep a regular diet with many rich fruits and vegetables. Other than the aforementioned chocolate (which isn’t that frequent), I cut out most sugar from my diet. You see, diabetes runs so high in my family that 80% of my aunts and uncles had it by the time they were 30. My grandfathers both had it so bad that one (on my mother’s side) had to have his feet amputated, and my other one (on my father’s side) nearly lost all of his sight. On top of that, cancer seems like a trend. Even living as purely as I can, it seems like everything is still high risk.
Now, one thing I’d like to see a study on is how many people who are in prison get cancer due to contaminants and chemicals, even the food and water of the prison. That’s a risk factor in itself, being in prison! Why aren’t there studies done by the CDC for that? I believe it’s justified. Two guys on my wing (and I’ve only been here for 4 months) went from energetic workout machines and athletes to having every single step being painful. I suspect different cancers. And this is the newest prison in the state of New Jersey. Imagine the ancient ones still in use!
That fact alone makes me constantly analyze my body and it causes me stress and anxiety worrying about my health. But, what more can I do? My options are limited and health services are a farce.

You know the kind I mean. They are the ones who like women as people and treat and speak to us accordingly. I can tell they have good relationships with the women in their lives; mothers, sisters, aunts, maybe even friends. But Camp Prisoney Land has an infinite variety of adorable fawning cats, who are amenable to almost any proposal. Really beautiful show-worthy cats. Or really kinked up cats. Or Jimmy Hendrix cats who miaou ‘are you experienced… do you wanna be’? No matter an officer’s outside life situation, it is very difficult for them to turn down such a selection. Both the boys and the girls.
So, there I was at 2:00 a.m. in the morning on my way to the bathroom when Officer Virile stepped out of the cell door immediately into my path. Oh no, I thought, not you too! He just stood there blocking the way. I stopped short and cast my eyes first down at the floor, then up at the ceiling. Finally, I held up the toilet paper. He stepped back slightly into the cell he had just evacuated so I could pass. I averted my gaze, making no eye contact. Just like Gary Oldman in Dracula, I waved my hand in front of Virile’s face as I passed by and chanted ‘do not see me’.
Later that morning, after waking early for my walk to medical for morning blood pressure checks, I was waiting for the Laundry room directly in front of the officer’s station. A very large full plastic bag filled with the dorm’s trash awaited pick up by the morning disposal crew. Officer Virile comes barreling out of the doof and flings a small trash bag from his office at me. I reflexively caught it. He demanded I empty his trash into the dormitory’s trash bag. That’s when I looked him straight in the eye and handed the back back, “Sorry, Officer Trash cannot mix with Inmate Trash.”"

As I walked around the small oval track, I found myself completely lost in the music. I had abandoned my physical body and risen high into the calm blue ether. I was coasting above the stratus clouds, consumed within the cloister of a chord progression. And then asn alto riff would take me higher into the sky.
Suddenly, as I bent the curve of the smooth pavement, facing the building, I looked up and was surprised to see that everyone was gone except for two stern-faced guards standing next to the opened door. Apparently, they had closed the courtyard and I didn’t hear the announcement over the loud-speaker. Removing my headphones as I approached the guards and the opened door, one of the guards jokingly said to me, “we were waiting to see how long it would take you to realize that everyone went in.”
“Yeah,” I said, smiling and tapping my headphones with my index finger, “I guess I got a little too caught up in the clouds.”"

My lover awaits me only feet away. Beckoning me with her alluring array of colors she displays daily. She gaily decorates her austere white cup. Promising a good time she calls for Herman, questioning his lack of progress in picking her up.
Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle.
My heart beats faster as I realize they could keep me from my daily dose of destiny. My breath begins to come in ragged gasps. Hands shaking, I stumble forward. Thump, thump! Thump, thump! I feel lightheaded from my anxiety as I come to the conclusion that I’m purposely being kept from my love, my destiny.
“Get back in line,” comes the directive.
Not listening, I continue on a straight course to her beckoning array.
“Hey! Did you hear me?” He asks as I stumble past another inmate. “Get your ass back in line!”
Ignoring his warning I push someone to the side. Hands grab at my arm, but I easily pull away. She calls again from her prison and I answer with a quiet snarl.
Now the guard moves in on me with his radio in hand, signaling a disturbance. I am almost within reach of her. Then the unthinkable happens- destiny is being wheeled away from me as the guard steps into my path. Without hesitation I barrel into him like a defensive lineman, knocking him to the floor.
I am slammed into from behind. Allowing my momentum to carry me into an inmate, I use him for balance as I swing behind me to block any more attacks as I pursue destiny. As I reach to grab the cart holding my lover I feel the bite of the taser in my back. I grab the edge as the current begins to flow through me. As I start to lose consciousness I see my lover and her friends fly in all directions. Then darkness surrounds me.
“No!” I shout, but no sound comes out. The thickness of my tongue and gumminess of my mouth alert me to the fact that I have been shot up with something.
Yet to open my eyes, I realize I’m strapped down to the bed by my hands and ankles. A soreness in my muscles reminds me of the tazing I took. There is no play in the restraints that bind me. I begin to shake as I realize I can’t move.
My eyes fly open. Sunlight pours into my room. What was thought to be restraints was nothing more than a tangle of sheets. I lie awake in my room at home. It was only a dream. The pain coming from cramped muscles. A mobile of pills slowly spins above my bed. A constant reminder of my weakness. A co-dependency of mind and reality, but it’s my reality. As I emerge from the fog of my dreams to find maybe it wasn’t a dream after all.
As I watch, a small half-dollar sized Pac-Man moves wraith-like through the wall heading straight for the mobile. In a panic I start to reach for it to save it, but am restrained. As I fight the tangle, the wraith continues to devour my mobile and I go into a frenzy.
It’s as if I become so entangled that I cannot move. Spittle flies from my mouth from an endless cry for mercy. Then Pac-Man flees as Donkey Kong moves into the room with a syringe for an arm. He jams it into my thigh and within seconds my panic begins to slow. His poison courses into my blood causing me to become disembodied. I blink once, then twice, and the scene changes to an all too familiar antiseptic room. Donkey Kong becomes the night nurse and I realize the dream was my reality as I drift off to la la land."

They’ve attempted to convert me to a meek, docile, subjugated slave with no voice. But this shouldn’t shock the conscious. These are the same ones who will forced a man to labor under involuntary servitude yet not contribute any of the proceeds to his child support debt or education fund for said prisoner’s child.
Kaepernick and others are being slighted for their silent protests...here in this parallel universe, one’s silent protest is a quiet hymn that will forever be sung from the grave…
If I had to be brutally honest with myself, I’d probably acknowledge that I’m growing weary. Tiresome. Exhausted. But those are unwelcomed weaknesses that only distract my existence. If I wasn’t an invisible man with a hoarse throat--who only speaks in whispers because no one is listening--I could expound on how I am the matter that I am composed of.
But I’m neither real with myself nor tangible to others, so my pleas are but ghost-writings; incessant weeping to deaf ears. My irrelevance is in vogue. I know this because everyone is into it. No, seriously! My disregard is the latest craze with lawyers, publications, advocates for social justice, and sadly enough--relatives.
SMH. Are we not the same? Temples of flesh and bone endowed with hope and compassion adorned with immaculate flaws? Someplace, our bridge to nowhere has to meet, and people out here have to grasp that when people in here try to uplift ourselves, they’re helping us by validating our value, also helps society.
If we lose sight of all that is not this, all we see is the misery of those becoming criminally insane. What’s to stop us from becoming it? Without righteous intervention, when the doors open for the prisoner, that miserable insanity seeps out into the free world like raw sewage from an eroded pipeline. Waste.
Rather than resent-filled recidivists returning to our women, children and seniors...what if when we reached out, we were acknowledged? Seen? Heard? Our pain and desire to rise from the ashes palpable enough to resonate with the common folk.
And while I’m feeding on dream-filled “what if’s,” what if the cretins of the prison industrial complex removed the shackles from our feet, the bells from around our necks, and most importantly, lifted the prohibition from our will to aspire and achieve?
As James Allen stated “a man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it,” because if not, “aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.” Is this what they want for us? Me?
I don’t want to be the filthy topic of a discussion held in some criminal justice course class where they weigh my words and discard me when the bell rings. No. Be a bridge...link to me http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XGBFWST and together we can set off a chain of events that will evolve the worldview of the incarcerated for the better.

Today, a non-profit organization dealing with families of prisoners were to walk the tiers of the shu; this did not interest him. There was a quiet hush on the tier, as always. The occasional flush of a toilet could be heard.
The rotunda door slowly slid open. In came two women and a man. He did not see them; the TV had his full attention. They walked from cell to cell talking to the inmates. Quick disengaged conversations.
Three cells down, he heard the cry through his perforated plexiglass covered door. It was a small cry as a mew of a kitten, small lungs belting forth disagreement, yearning for milk, for need.
He was clad in gray thermal bottoms and top. He slouched to the door. The source of the cries was warmly bundled up in the young lady’s arms, it’s closed eyes and rosy cheeks barely visible beneath a small baby blue beanie. A boy.
The baby clenched his tiny fists and wailed. The baby’s small mighty cries climbed the walls, up the high ceiling, and into his cell; up his spine, beneath his bones, and into his heart. He was entranced.
He thought of his first lover, succumbing to passion. He remembered his father coming home from working in the orange fields, too tired to talk, too tired so he slept. He remembered walking downtown seeing a man standing in the uppermost window of the Radisson barefooted, curtains flapping in the breeze; the fire department below telling the man not to jump. His mother had told him to close his eyes. The man had jumped. He did not close his eyes.
But he did not remember the last time he heard a baby cry. The cries cocooned him in reverberating chills. Mind, body, and soul were moved.
He was on his knees, hands outstretched above his head. “My God!” he said. “My God, my God!” He had not heard a baby cry in thirty-seven years. Beneath the chest, beneath the ribs, came forth a deep guttural cry. His and the baby’s cries mingled into a pleading for their needs; salvation and milk, always milk. He had not cried in thirty-seven years."

A trigger is pulled, life its toll
A widow weeps, love is lost

A hand joins hand, as two they are strong
A ring, a veil, bring on the wedding bells

A knee is skinned, tears they fall
A frantic cry, arms open wide
A swoop of love, bandaged and clean
A kiss upon knee, a smile is born

A screech of tires, busting glass
A world goes dark, fading fast
A head is cradled, tears they fall
A warm embrace for just a little while
In the blink of an eye
A blink before think can often sink
A sink can wash a blink if we think
A thought! Think of a blink as a sink
A final blink? Nothing more than a blink"

I visited mainly because I wanted to see the big, 10-foot long model of the Enterprise used in the Star Trek TV series for special effects shots. But what really stuck in my mind was the exhibition of Socialist Realist art put out by the Soviet Union to propagandize for their space program. Looking back on it, the imagery was indeed overblown and bombastic; but for a star-struck teenager, the pictures were the biggest turn-on I had ever seen.
To make a long story seem short, my backpack was stolen by a jerk in Elkhart, Indiana who drove off with it, deserting me in a roadside diner while I was using the men’s room.

I… I just needed some help.”
He flicked his smoke away and stared into the smaller Billy. “Help? Help? Don’t we all need some help? I need help, you need help, this shit world needs help. No job, no money. Ulcers, my wife’s a whore, kids are shit. Truck’s empty and broke. Help, you little son of a bitch. Don’t whine to me. I’ll… I’ll!” The crazed man took toward Billy and sent him running.
What scared Billy the most was the truth which came rushing back. A few scattered memories flooded his now waking mind. Loss of job, loss of money, broken this, broken that. He remembered the man’s words before he said those exact things coming to a slow job. A long jumping noose still hung in tow, and a red house peeked from around the corner. Billy shook off the hurtful words of his last encounter and tried to hang on to some hope. Up ahead in clear view sat a lone woman on the porch. “Excuse me, ma’am. May I trouble you for a little help?” Billy asked softly. The woman lined up her face with Billy, and now he could see the old dried tears and snot on her nose. “I’m sorry, ma’am. Are you OK?”
“OK? OK?” She stared up, rising out of her position. “Do I look OK? My husband lies on that old couch, dead. I’m 40 years old, and I’m not OK. My life is over, and you got some nerve coming up here. Get, or, I’ll… I’ll...”
Billy didn’t wait to see what she would offer. Trailed by a limp noose and no help, he jogged off. The hurt and anger he experienced was too much: why? He was trying to help.
Billy slowed and the floodgates opened. Remembering came easy. Pulling out his black and white photo, he looked into it and saw a movie in his mind. His love at first sight for the second time lay dead on a cold metal table. Billy heard his own voice, “Yes, doctor. That’s her, my wife.” Sorrow swept through him, and tears flowed as he realized he had the same feelings as the crying woman. Shattered dreams formed, and Billy tore the photo to pieces.
Then he stood and sucked up his nose to take a deep breath before marching to the nearest tree with his noose in hand. With eyes dimmed red, a pounding head, and a still heart, Billy took the first few feet of noose and climbed up a tree, holding tight. Once satisfied, he knotted and double knotted what was left then sat on the branch that would hold his life. Biting his lower lip and trembling, he felt anger and alone. Black sweet sleep, not a problem to care. “The good life,” he said aloud to a few birds and whistling leaves. One last breath, and he would go.
“Excuse me mister… Hey, up there.” Billy woke up to a small voice pleading for his attention. A bright head of pigtails said, “Hey mister. I need some help, please.” Billy tried to ignore her and go back to his sedated self. “ Please, sir. I’m lost. Can you please help me?”
Billy could no longer ignore the voice. “Dammit, what do you want?” he yelled.
“Please, I can’t find the big white house. Can’t you help me? I’m scared.”
Billy held her eyes, and with a grunt, he began pulling at the knots. Slowly, they gave, and he crawled down the scratch tree. “OK, little girl. Where is the house? Let’s hurry because I have things to do,” Billy grumbled.
“I thought it was over here. Please, can’t you help me?” She began to tear.
This broke Billy in a new way for in these last 10 minutes, he felt a new feeling to want to stop this girl’s crying and get her to this white house. “Oh come, now. Don’t cry. We’ll find it.” With that, she cheered up. Billy walked her hand-in-hand down the road, and finally, after many glances, she had to know. “What’s that around your neck? A jump rope?”
Billy didn’t have the heart to tell her the truth. “Yes, just a jump rope… Oh! Look ahead, a white house!” The two sped to the house, and the girl smiled for joy; Billy didn’t know why he was smiling. “What is this place?” Billy asked aloud as the girl jumped into a man’s burly arms.
“Hey friend. We’ve been looking everywhere for you,” the man said to Billy who never saw the man before. “Here, let me help you with that.” The man slipped the old noose clean and tossed it down. “Yes, a much better look.”
“How? What?” Billy shook his head, trying to collect the words… The man slung a large arm over Billy’s shoulders.”
“Buddy, I’ve been looking for you, everywhere. Glad my daughter found you. Now, come inside--I want you to meet a few people.” Though he was confused (who? me? friend? daughter?), pushing gently to the massive white house full of smiling faces didn’t feel wrong. “I can stop looking for you. Come on inside, it’s a great day. Everything’s gonna be alright.”
Billy finally found the words. “It’s the House of the Lord, and you’re our main guest. Come on in…” Right then, the memories fell harder in all the right places. He remembered the anger, the pain, hurt, but a stronger new feeling took over. The familiar man’s face came into the picture. The embracing arm and smiling people, the white house and slowly the memory of the noose faded. The mean man didn’t seem so mean, the hurt woman not so hurt. Billy took a few handshakes and made his way to the front pews. The Holy Spirit filled him, and his smiling wife was no longer a ripped picture but an angel looking down. His lost job meant an opportunity for a new one, and Billy sang for the first time since that noose snapped. Billy smiled with tears of joy."
1952,“Ghost Train” by Jacob Ecker,,No,2019.0,02 - February,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Railroad-Track-picture-b34f2bfd780042899829127dda3b4b96,Anna Nguyen,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Zc9ks7EV1dP5TKY9BnZP8Z72sBGYWRGjSFz6XIDkzo/edit,No,"Quite admirably so…
I breathe in deeply and exhale slowly and look around me trying to figure out where I am and how I got here. I feel a tremor in the tracks and look behind me to so it: there is a train approaching but I don’t see or hear anything, and yet.. The almost indiscernible vibrations I feel are already noticeably intensifying, though subtle. Something is coming.
Still trying to get a bearing on my surroundings, I notice a light off in the distance. No. That’s not right, it’s...fog..a fog compromised of blinding pale light, tenuous, shifting and insubstantial, and yet… I am chilled to the bone by its very presence.
The amorphous fog begins to slowly expand, drifting closer to me as it it can sense me, and suddenly, I’m quite sure it does sense me!
I’m thoroughly convinced this cloud retains a modified level of primal intelligence as it slowly drifts toward me. Hell, it could be omniscient for all I know, and it suddenly occurs to me that I must flee and escape it!
But, as I turn to run in the opposite direction, I see another equally queer and terrific sight.
It is a train... and yet... it is not a train.
I place its origin of manufacturing somewhere in the early 1950s, if the model is of any indication, with its shovel headed engine billowing out trails of smoke from the distended pipes that repose upon its gargantuan head. This in itself is baffling, but there are two other startling distinctions I observe in the monolith that are shocking. The first is that as this old relic is barreling down the track towards me, it is making absolutely no noise; no cute “choo-choo” from the horn, no chugging from the wheels as it hastily speeds its way down the rails like a metallic bat out of Hell. Just this persistent, if not ominous, silence which seems to persuade the immediate area instilling me with a gnawing sense of dread that goes bone deep.
My second observation of this steel wraith turn my insides to ice.
This train, which looks nothing short of solid wavers in and out of existence, shimmering from a substantial form to something...less. Translucent and wan, though nothing less than threatening or deadly.
I know I should run, but I am rooted to the spot, paralyzed and transived with complete shock and awe that are absolutely planetary in their proportions. But the revelation that suddenly strikes me is much more profound, as I realize that what I am looking at defies the “fabrication” from which it originated with its actual existence.
It is a ghost train and it's coming to take me away. I suddenly remembered the fog which I initially endeavoured to flee, and turn to discover that it has already advanced considerably, making any further attempts a vain and doomed failure.
I can do nothing but wait for the end to occur as I am caught between two titans of terror with nowhere to run or hide.
The panic and apprehension that are feit are inexplicable as I wonder if the demise will be painful and filled with unbearable agony, or if my death will be swift and painless.
And then, quite abruptly, right before I am mowed down by the colossal ghost train , or spirited away by the mysterious fog. I am rudely awoken by my friend.
“Dude, wake up,” he said. “Time to leave...by the way, you look so stoned, Molly’s gonna know you are high.”
I smile a quaint smile as he turns to leave, getting up and following after him.
Pausing momentarily, I give the train tracks surrounded by the forest one more speculative glance, shake my head, then catch up to my firend.
Some things are better off alone."

I love the wild taste of deer, and it is a vegetarian. What would it be like if the animal instead of being hunted became the hunter? They are so quiet in the woods. I’ve had them walk right under the very tree I was sitting in.
Talk about a surprise. Couldn’t even get a shot off. I watched as three walked right on by. After they left, so did I. Just didn’t have the heart to pull the trigger. If I had missed then it would have scared them all away.
One of the last hunting trips I went on, led us into a hunting club. All you had to do was pick a number out of the hat and that will tell you which area you hunted in. I felt it deep in my bones. It felt like it was my day for sure.
I pulled my number. It was seven. One of the hunters offered me a new twenty-dollar bill. No, proud me wouldn’t listen to my inner self. I had spent more than that on shells, food, gas and an orange vest. I;ve been told deer are color blind. To me I have my doubts. When I wear the vest nothing is brought home. Almost like the deer are laughing at the fluorescent highlighter in the tree.
My trusty stand would wrap around the tree. Itis blades would dig in. Not hurting the tree. My feet hug the straps and I would hug the tree pulling myself up like an inchworm. I had figured about forty-feet would be high enough.
It felt good to hold on to the tree, and step back putting my full weight on the back. I bounced hard to lock it down. Felt like it was deep enough. Slow and easy, I turned to sit down.
Looking down and around. It hit me that this could have been a mistake. I know most people have had a feeling that something just wasn’t right: Twenty minutes went by, and haven’t seen even a bird or squirrel.
Right about now that twently was looking great. It wasn’t long before I felt the tree move. I could see the trees around me swaying with a light breeze. Then a jolt brought me to reality. Was it the wind or movement of the tree? This tree was a pine. Hardwood trees don’t work too well, silence the bark is really fine. Then it happened again. This time I went for the ride of my life. From the height of forty-four feet to just about eighteen-inches from the ground. On the way down I couldn’t decide if I wanted to throw my rifle or jump.
With that sudden stop. It was a real close call. That was well over thirty-five years ago and since then I gave up deer hunting. No-more deer stands and Bambie is safe from me."

“Ms. Flecker, I’m here,” she said, raising her hand quickly to get the teacher’s attention. “I’m Shelly Montous.”
That’s when Mark first saw Shelly. Her deep brown inviting eyes and her long raven black hair that gleamed with the classroom lights highlighting its shimmering glow.
All Mark could remember about their first encounter was her warm eyes that captured his soul with that long glance. His shyness seizes his voice, preventing him from saying hello or just acknowledging her with “Welcome to Woodlawn Pleasantville Elementary School.”
In life those days, Mark found each encounter with Shelly as a majestic orchestra languid flows. Seeing Shelly through the years, Mark’s lack of ambition to communicate his thoughts and feelings crippled his potential relationships. When Mark would see Shelly at the mall, grocery shopping and other events he would experience the spring-like internal bird songs that would echo casual pleasantries that stirred their heartstrings. Mark was just through in through, he just couldn’t muster the courage needed to share his feelings.
Now sixteen years after graduation, Mark has gained confidence, now owns a well-established printing company and has lots of friends. On many occasions, Mark went to social events hosted by his close friend Helen Lawson. As Mark was driving to this evening’s dinner, his mind played the performance as he always had done for Helen. “Just play your part,” he says to himself. He reminds himself again, this time he looked in the rearview mirror.
He found these social events very stuffy and boring, but Helen was a good friend who brought many well-paying clients over the years. Now walking in the massive cloister hall, the elegant decor was mind-blowing, for there were many penguin suits and glamorous evening gowns that this dinner would put the governor’s ballroom dinners to shame. Helen really knew her business. As Mark mingled, he smiled, said a joke or tow and greeted the people he knew. Then it happened, the air in the room changed. Like a distant song playing in the background. “Shelly,” he exclaimed softly, for Shelly was now standing there by the waterfall fountain.
As he walks towards her, she doesn’t see him. His walk became that much desperate as he sped up his pace, for this is the moment he searches for. Shelly now saw him and instantaneously recognized Mark from across the room. Their eyes meet and they danced. She smiled softly with an exigent glow.
For the first time, they knew true love’s gaze as they approached each other. As they introduced themselves finally the world around them seemed to disappear. The air now seemed to smell like the essence of seasonal change as they drink deeply the pinot noir of yesterday’s dreams and ambitions. Shelly and Mark were married six months later.
Mark’s reminiscent moment is interrupted by Mark Jr.’s cooing. Now looking down in awe at this sweet and precious gift, a passage comes to mind. “My offspring will be like the grains of sand of the sea.” Mark wants a big family, even though the world is so dysfunctional and is highly addicted to drugs. Mark now holds his son’s feet in his hands. The softness of his feet remind him of two radiant rose petals. His heart systematically melts as tears erupt down his face, for he’s happy. He calls out to Shelly, “Hey Shelly, come here for a minute?”
“Yeah, what do you need honey,” she says as she walks into the room.
“Come look at Mark’s little feet. Don’t they look like little rose petals?” Mark says proudly. Shelly tilts her head to the side as her long hair gracefully falls from her shoulder, she smiles and says tenderly,
“That’s nice.”"

So one of them grabbed the T.V. remote and turned on a soap opera. “The Young and the Restless.” Created for bored housewives, but watched by bored prisoners too. I cleaned my barber tools and swept the area and then in walked Gary, an old, wrinkled, thin white man with clear green eyes, long hair and a scraggly beard. His hair and clothes were damp remnants of being thrown In the shower earlier. His left eye was swollen shut. Kinda purplish… his bottom lip was split… he walked to where the officer called him to, he had a slight limp… his steps were very uncertain as if he were walking on a tightrope… the officer pointed over at me, “Go on over there old timer, Mr. Hart is gonna clean you up!” He came over to our area, the black area, I pointed at my barber chair, “Have a seat young man, let me see what I can do for you.” My words brought a smile to his face, but as he sat down I could smell him… a wild animal smell… he needed a bath. I looked him In the eye and introduced myself then asked him what happened. He explained that some guys told him to take a shower, that he was stinking up the place and when he told them he had no soap or shower shoes or deodorant, one guy socked him in the eye knocking him to the ground and continued hitting him as he lay on the ground… another guy joined in the beating, they dragged him to the shower and put the water on. They got a kick out of that, but an eagle-eyed tower officer witnessed the beating, activated his alarm and a small posse of officers came in, handcuffed the suspects and pulled him from the shower floor…
The smell was taking its toll so I excused myself and went to my cell and retrieved a fresh towel, a pair of my celly’s boxers which I knew the man could fit, a bar of Irish Spring soap, a pair of shower shoes, a brand new speed stick deodorant, a bottle of shampoo I had been using, 5 top ramen soups, a pouch of tuna, a toothbrush, a tube of close up toothpaste, put it all In a plastic bag and brought it down to the barber area, I pointed at the shower, “Go and get you a shower, everything in the bag is yours, we will find you some clothes by the time you are finished showering, and wash your hair too, brush your teeth… you will not get attacked In this building, nobody will lay a finger on you.”
The old man stared at me with those ice green eyes. Trying to find reasoning behind me being nice to him. I stared right back at him. Then saw somebody heading to the vacant shower with their shower bag In their hand. I called them by name and stopped them in their tracks. “Hold up on that shower, I got Gary going In there… you can go after him.” The guy nodded his head in understanding and headed to the domino table which was in full swing.
Gary went and took his shower, and while he did, other inmates in the building of all races began approaching me, asking me what was going on with the old, beat up white guy… I explained as best I could… an officer pushed a cart into the building that contained Gary’s personal property. I noticed a 13’ flatscreen T.V. and a fan right away, but other than that I observed no personal clothing that we are allowed to purchase such as grey T-shirts, shorts, sweat pants, sweat shirts, thermals, (white also allowed) Nor did I see any personal sneakers… also, no commissary items such as hygiene products or food whatsoever!
Someone pointed at a card table where the ramen noodles and pouch of tuna I had donated to the cause sat and asked, “What's up with that?” I explained that Gary appeared to be down on his luck so I gave him a few things I had. I also explained that he needed clean clothes once he got out of the shower, because even though I had said he would get some, often-times people's intentions don't add up to their actions, and the clothes would probably arrive late. If they arrived at all…
Then a strange thing happened… Gary came out of the shower placed the other items and given him on the table along with the ramen and tuna. He sat down in my chair and as I began to cut his hair, somebody walked up and dropped a few more ramen on the table, another guy brought a bag of chips, someone else a bag of coffee.. Then came some clothes, more soap, a bottle of lotion… from guys doing time, guys who had never met this man in their lives… I mentioned a motto earlier that “we take care of our own” and that Is usually along racial lines but not on this day. I continued to cut Gary’s hair, tears streamed down his face as more people added this or that to the table. It was now full. A young white dude came over with a pair of Nike sneakers In his hand. They were used but clean. “Try these on old timer, they should fit, and if so throw those old boots away” The shoes fit, the boots went in the trash. I shaved his scraggly beard off last. He looked like a new man… the officer stepped out of his office, and took a full 2 minutes to absorb the scene and what was happening… he didn’t have to worry about anybody laying a hand on Gary, we had adopted him, he was one of us now. The officer made eye contact with me and nodded. He mouthed “I owe you one” Gary ended up being a great asset to the building, he was an artist and drew top of the line greeting cards, birthdays, christmas, mother’s day, easter, anniversaries, St. Valentine's day, thinking of you, it didn't matter, beautiful cards, one of a kind… people have a way of giving prisoners all kinda different names and titles, but I’d like to add one more to that list… “human”..."
1964,“The Atelier” by Robert Taliaferro,,No,2018.0,01 - January,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Girl-Praying-picture-871e32ac2e564f15b81cf3b17a5dbd76,Ryan Clover,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nBTrHxEJ0gdPxSbl99bwlLU2frJTudHWScNfNntlE4/edit,No,"The woman stood, confused, perfectly framed in the doorway to the small room. Spread around the atelier were a number of tables that had small tubes of paints. Large canvases of the master were hung haphazardly on the walls, while others were strewn on the floor.
Behind her hung one of the masters woven rugs; its ruby red acting as a backdrop to the young woman who stood in an ivory white veil that framed her face so perfectly that when the light struck her, just right, the students could not help but to be taken by her exotic beauty.
“Yes, yes,” the master said to himself, and that brought the students back from their reverie. They knew that when he was finished with his sketch, he would come around to look at their work, and if they did not have something substantial on the paper, they would wish that they had stayed home that night.
By then, the young woman was even more confused. She had been sent to the room to ask a question and here she was standing, while all of these crazy Frenchmen sketched furiously with pieces of charcoal on rags, and paper, and wood.
“Please my dear, could you turn a bit to your left, then raise your hands in prayer again?” the master asked, and she did as she was requested.
That slight movement brought into play the light reflecting off of her necklace and allowed the pearls on her forehead and hands to glisten whiter than white, like small stars that flashed within the radiance of the woman’s exotic nature.
Her bracelets never seemed to move, and the colors, muted as they were, offered a counterpoint to the pale shell-colored dress and pale blouse that the young woman wore.
“Could you stand straight forward and look up my dear,” the master said after a few more moments, and the woman--anxious to leave from this crazy place--did as she was asked.
“Notice the fullness of her eyes,” the master told his students, and he started to chuckle.
He knew that when he looked at the sketches of his students he was going to see perfect beauty defined by the beauty that radiated from the woman... yet, he would be disappointed in what they would create.
He often shared this disappointment with his wife Amelie. “They are great technical artists,” he would say, “but they seem to lack the ability to see the poetry of the models that they paint or draw. They don’t see beyond what is sitting there in front of them...they only see the subjective essence.”
The young woman began to search the room anxiously until she laid eyes on the young man on the furthest side of the room and tried to get his attention.
To her dismay, he was so focused on his canvas that he seemed to only see her as the object that he was to draw.
Seeing her discomfort, the master said, “Just a few more moments please...we are almost done here.”
Hearing that, she looked back at the master and was put at ease by the childish gleam in his eyes, only slightly hidden behind rounded glasses.
“Voila, I am done,” the master exclaimed, which was the signal to the others in the room that they were done as well.
“Thank you my dear, for your patience,” he said to the woman, who by now was obviously furious.
“So, did you want something?” the master asked, knowing full well that he was going to have a story to tell from the reply.
It was then that the woman entered the room fully, walked over to the man who was in the furthest end of the room and knocked his canvas from his hand.
The sketch appeased her anger a bit, as it was a perfect rendering of the beautiful young woman. She hid the small smile that she felt coming to her lips and picked up the canvas before she chastised the young man.
“Saddiq, do you wish to draw another thing of me, or are you now ready to get married?”
It was then that the master began to laugh, and his students followed suit.
“This is not the way to start a marriage,” the master said to his young student, “trust me...I know.” As the woman passed out of the room she glanced from drawing to drawing until she got the the drawing of the master.
“This...this,” she spluttered in anger, “this thing does not even look like me, she said, shocking the other people in the room. “You had me stand here only to humiliate me with such a thing as this,” she said, pointing at the drawing that was on the master’s pad.
Everyone in the room gasped, but the master only smiled, then raised his sketch so that everyone in the room could see what he had done.
“That is where you are wrong my dear,” Henri Matisse said to the young woman, “they have drawn you as you are now...I, however, have drawn you as the woman that you will become.”
As the woman stormed from the room with her future husband following close behind, the master pointed to the rendering that he had created.
“Notice that there is symmetry in her movements; the way that her beads drape from her neck and how the bracelets garnish her arms…” he said with a smile as she turned once again in anger, “and the fire in her eyes…”"

Aromas of bodily functions permeating throughout the unit vents.
Cuffed and walked like dogs with a leash --- pure torment.
Placed in a backyard kennel, just to receive fresh air, this becomes habitual.
Twenty-six steps in a circular motion within four corners, almost like a dance ritual.
Almost, they transformed me.
Almost, I almost gave life to a godless heathen, a misnomer placed upon me.
Instead, I reverted inward to my teachings of humility.
I refuse to allow these dictators dictate when, what, and how I feel.
Almost, I almost forgot the agreement I made with the creator, this was part of the deal.
This, I chose to experience, and on this journey I teach spirituality to those who are ill.
Twenty-three and a quarter hours without nutrients from the sun from which my body feeds.
One hour and sometimes less, my body doesn’t receive what it needs.
Bang, Bang, Bang, sounds of hate and harassment from the guards every fifteen to thirty minutes at the door.
Subjected to a psychiatric assault, almost inciting an uproar.
Temporarily trapped in Boraga, Michigan, in administrative segregation, Custody Level five.
Wasn’t supposed to be here in the first place, however, corruption, war and mistreatment of the people who built this country is how this country thrives.
I’ve learned that the Creator protects its children, and love is a force much greater than fear.
One must Love thy neighbor.
Almost, I almost allowed my oppressors to transform me into the wolf that resides within my lower nature.

Little Emily came to Peppermint’s side. Rebekah remained at my right. Rachel appeared at my left to fully form the semi-circle. The four young grandmothers convened as a petit jury read to, in public, pass judgment upon me for my petty transgression.
Peppermint rubbed my cheek. “Do you know what, girls? Tee Dee must be running a fever. Look at his face. It’s so red.”
Emily rocked forward onto her toes to finger my face in her own investigation. “No, she isn’t hot, Mama Peppermint.”
Rachel raised her eyebrows. She lightly patted my cheek, “Well, no, it’s not his face that’s hot.” She flipped an off-hand gesture toward my crotch. “The poor man’s unicorn blood is stirred up. That’s why his face is so red.”
The four girls twittered lightly at my expense. “Unicorn!” Peppermint echoed. “Do you know what, girls? That’s a good name for him. Tee Dee, for the rest of today, you have to answer to the Red Unicorn. That’s your name today. You’re our Red Unicorn.”
“I mean it, Red Unicorn!” Rebekah raved once more. “What’s something like her good for? She’s showing all of Houston what she’s good for. She’s too young to be worth the price she probably would charge.”
“Girls, let’s not pass judgment on the child,” Peppermint intoned.

Emily laughed. “Blatantly, yes. Do it behind my back like my husband used to do.”
Rebekah huffed: “Yes, behind my back, like my husband used to do. Next time, Red Unicorn, be discreet. That’s what I’m saying. You’ve got all of Houston to go be a dog. And that’s where you’ll find that girl. She’ll be walking in front of the cheap motels on Airline Drive waiting for you. But whatever else you do, Tee Dee, you treat all four of us girls holy. Holy! That includes respecting me enough to be discreet about that windowshopping, Red Unicorn.”
Peppermint pointed beside her. “Girls? Line up right here in the mall. Red Unicorn, you start with Rachel here, then Emily, then me and then Rebekah. Come around here, Rebekah, besides me.” The four grandmothers fell into place. “Now you go right down the line, Red Unicorn. You give each one of my girls an apology, a kiss, and a hug.”
Rachel looked me up and down. “You have to say the Red Unicorn is sorry. Or the Ex-Unicorn,” she giggled.
There was nothing to it but to do it. “Rachel? The Red Unicorn is sorry for embarrassing you.”
And so the penance was performed. Each of the girls received an apology from the de-horned Red Unicorn. Each woman then restored me to communion by giving me a kiss with a hug.
This was 1998, some 20 years ago. I wonder how that young girl look today. She’d be 38 or so by now. I wonder if her shorts still let everything hang out. Yeah, I’d still look. Bow-Wow-Wow-Yippie-Aye-Yippie-Yea (lyrics to the “Atomic Dog”).

“Part Two: The Pink-And-Blue Red Unicorn” by Matthew Tomlinson
This photo of the man staring at the girl’s back brings back a memory. It’s a memory that I almost don’t have. Look, things all work this way. In September 1987, I came to Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) bringing a 10 year old sentence with me. In September 1997, TDCJ released me. In October 2000, TDCJ welcomed me back with a 99 year sentence. I haven’t seen daylight since then, and I never will again. That 37 months “extended furlough” (if you can remember what furloughs were) is all the street time they’ll ever give me.
During these 18 years (and small change) back in TDCJ, I’d almost forgotten the Red Unicorn incident. Peppermint, Rachel, Emily, and Rebekah all still write to me regularly. Someone else also writes from time to time. Prisoner Express mailed me the Summer 2018 Newsletter with this photo. About ten days later, someone put a photocopy of the Newsletter in a manila envelope. They block-printed my name, TDCJ number, and address using a broad-tipped blue marker. In the return address area, they used a pink marker to draw a smiley face. The USPS postmarked the manila envelope from Terre Haute, Indiana.
Enclosed with the photocopied Newsletter was digital artwork. They drew the “My Little Pony” cartoon character. They added a Pink-and-Blue swirling unicorn to the pony. The unicorn itself was fluorescent, flaming red. Atop the horn, as if it were a flagpole, were the crossed flags of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Below this Red Unicorn, in computer-produced Pink-and-Blue block letters, was my KD5CHN ham radio callsign.
Pink-and-Blue, whoever they are, reads Prisoner Express. Pink-and-Blue knew about the Red Unicorn incident. Pink-and-Blue wanted me to write the story, “The Red Unicorn Arises,” for the January 2019 Photo Theme prompt. It wasn’t on my schedule to introduce fellow Prisoner Express addicts to Peppermint and her girls quite yet. Terre Haute rearranged my schedule.
It’s true that this photo is Rebekah and me. But it isn’t. I’m not as tall as this guy. I’m 5 feet, 7 inches (170 centimeters). Back in 1998, when this photo must have been taken, my hair was no more than 4 inches long (102 millimeters). In those spots, my hair would still grow. This guy has a headful of hair (well, in 1978, I had a headful of hair too!). I was spotlessly clean-shaven in the days when this photo was taken. Now, that is one of my shirts. It would’ve been neatly pressed; elsewhere, one of the girls would’ve stripped it off me for ironing. It would’ve been neatly tucked; elsewsie, one of the girls would have tucked it in.
This photo is us. But it isn’t. I know this was 1998 because for the prior 30 years (since 1968 in second grade) I had worn Coke-bottled glasses. The girls had bargained and badgered me, at 38 then, to get my first set of contacts. As you can estimate from the photo, those brand-new contacts worked better than Rebekah would have preferred. Bow-Wow-Wow-Yippee-Aye-Yippee-Yea! (lyrics from the “Atomic Dog”). But that isn’t Rebekah, for she’s my height. Emily is about that much shorter than me. That’s Emily’s height but Rebekah’s general facial features. Then again, the face is not quite Rebekah’s face. The photo is us. Yet, it’s not.
Fellow Prisoner Express addicts, remember the December 2018 photo theme showing the couple in the convertible? You remember my three stories about “The Trinity Project”? The Witch of the Rains explained that situation to me. “You’ve had moments when you were writing, for example. You were briefly distracted – maybe you paused to open a Dr. Pepper can. Then, when you returned to your writing, you completely forgot what you intended to write. ""Your mind was completely blank,” La Bruja de La Lluvia illustrated. “The couple in the convertible had such a moment. For several seconds, each of them forgot who they were, what they were doing, everything. Their minds went blank,” La Viajera instructed. “For several seconds, we were them,” The Lady Traveler summarized. “Then, we were not.”
In the December 2018 Photo Theme, we were the couple in the convertible… then, we weren’t. In the January 2019 Photo Theme, the photo was us… but it wasn’t.
All right. This is Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit. I can relate all that to the “Major Psychiatric” part of the name. They’ve had me in segregation for 3½ years for now. I almost never leave my cell. So, the Witch of the Rain manifests herself to me; right? Nobody else discerns La Bruja de La Lluvias, right? The Lady Traveler comes to me in my dreams, right? La Viajera, while I sleep, transports me from Amarillo to places like Trinity Site down in East Texas, right? Yeah, I can relate all of that to 3½ years of segregation. It’s all a figment; right?
Where, then, does The Pink-and-Blue Red Unicorn fit into that sigment?

1977,"""In a Perfect World"" by Robert Taliaferro",,No,2017.0,12 - December,Word Theme Essay,https://www.notion.so/Thankful-4222ec4c132c4e8bb8f48112aa6afa11,Katie Kwak,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BK1zBlgSeTmTFhdbE6kOMdYiFmOfK1jS5xvHIgg6ecc/edit,No,"One of the jailhouse Christians once noted that I should be thankful that I am alive and that I have my health. Another jailhouse Muslim agreed with him and they tried to invite me to come to a Jumah service to see how one could give thanks for that health and life.
As I get older, and perhaps wiser, I tend to be a bit more tolerant of those who simply follow blindly to a particular theology whether it is religious in nature, an idealism regarding why a specific ideology is practiced on the streets, or worse, those who follow anything regardless of how foolish it is, simply because they want to belong to something.
Don’t get me wrong, if people want to give thanks at Thanksgiving or Christmas or Valentine’s Day or Easter Sunday, that’s all fine, and that is something that they have a right to do. My question is, however, why does one have to just wait for a specific event, or a specific day to be thankful?
In a perfect world, for me, people would be thankful for things that would be sensible. They would be thankful when young men in Chicago stop killing each other over street corners.
They would be thankful to see the smile on their child’s face on a visit and be thankful that someone answers the phone when they call, especially after they cursed out their mom, dad, girlfriend, aunt, wife, sister, brother on the last call.
They would be thankful to gain their freedom and the decision never to come back to prison again. They would be thankful that they were born who they are, and not subscribe to be someone else because that other person has more money, or better clothes, or a newer car or a bigger house.
As the 1970s song went, “Just be thankful, for what you got.”
In my world, the only thing that I can be thankful for is that I have beautiful, intelligent children, grandchildren, and now great grandchildren, and even with that thought, there is the tragedy that 1) I selfishly took a life to get where I am today and 2) because of that action, I cannot truly share in the lives of those young people whom I love so much...but, as this is not a perfect world, I suppose that I can give thanks for one thing: The fact that when I do die someday, I will not have been just an asterisk in the cosmic book of life and that my line will not end with me, as it will happen with so many of the people in prison today.
I often think about that and hope that one day one of my daughters or sons--or their progeny--will do great things. Perhaps one may find a cure for cancer of HIV/AIDS. Perhaps one will become a judge or win a Pulitzer or Nobel. Perhaps one will simply show the world how to make an unselfish sacrifice that will have a global impact some day.
Or...perhaps they will just be proud to be my progeny, regardless of the foolishness that landed me in prison.
I guess now I can conclude this treatise with a smile. That one guy was right...after all, in order to have those great children in my life, I have to be alive and healthy…
Damn!"

Instead of TV, I told him about others like him, who couldn’t keep calm: Truman Trobridge; beat to death with a mop wringer, for getting sassy with a guy who was not big and tough, but was sneaky. Albert McDonald, stabbed to death with a spoon-handle for being Kop’s kiss-up. And on and on, even though that now, the kops have cameras everywhere.

I passed by there last fall on my way to the nursing home. There was a girl there playing her flute. She hadn’t told me she had a little sister, but the girl was the spitting image of the only woman I ever loved.
The place was like I remembered it, but all the trees were dying. I wanted to ask the girl about her sister, but the ambulance driver said he wasn’t allowed to stop. I rolled down the window and barely heard a few notes wafting on the breeze. I hummed along.

I was alone.

His face and clothes are blank to me. I only see the back of his head on the page, thick hair trailing slightly over his collar. Of course he had a knife. They usually have something: a knife, a gun, brute strength or the element of surprise.
He doesn’t speak at first, just punches me in the face. I fall down onto stuffed trash bags. One of them breaks as I land on it. Next he’s holding the blade to my face just under my left eye. I try to remember what I learned at a rape awareness seminar I attended in college.
Don’t resist. Don’t struggle. Don’t fight. Don’t do anything that might cause your attacker to kill you.
My skirt rips along with a part of my mind, which flies away from my body. The assault seems to drag on and on but is really over in minutes. I’m safe in my detached refuge watching what is happening to my body lying on the ground.
I can’t feel anything in this moment, not even anger, which comes later. I’m just relieved it looks like he’s going to be done soon. He groans and goes limp. It’s over. I snap back into my body. He’s heavy and leaning on my chest. I can’t catch my breath but I try to push him off. Then his fingertips brush across my face, closing my eyelids as he turns my head away to the wall. I’m waiting for the blade on my throat, but he pushes hard on my shoulders and gets to his feet. Then he’s gone.
The cold air slices my body; rolling to my knees I push my skirt back down and hold the torn edges together. The car isn’t too far away. I fumble with my keys and manage to lock the door. Finally, I get the car open and collapse into the passenger seat, crawl behind the steering wheel and engage the automatic locks. I sit and sit until I start screaming, shaking and banging the car with my fists. I’m so mad at myself. Why didn’t I fight him, hit him with my fist or at least with my big purse?
But that was years ago and today I am sitting by a calm pool of water. Droplets hit the surface one by one. Like an old soldier, I am looking at this wound clear of shrapnel and long healed. Almost. Almost, I am saying the words with gritted teeth and turning the last page.
May this person be whole, may this person be healthy, may this person be happy, may this person be at peace."

They had a “Monkey Island,” populated with a species of monkeys that looked like snow monkeys, but probably weren’t. A moat surrounded their island, filled with various species of turtles. On their island a couple of dead, nude trees were propped up, there are a couple concrete mounds, a cave, and not much else. The monkeys often looked miserable or pissed.
Sometimes, as a teen, I’d stare at those monkeys, imagining what they were thinking. Sometimes one of them stared back, hold my stare, looking pissed, thinking, I though,
Yeah, I’m stuck on this turd-covered island, surrounded by water! You damn humans know we’re scared of bodies of water, won’t try to cross it. Turds everywhere–I don’t even try to avoid stepping in ‘em anymore. And these idiots I’m surrounded by! Those two are fighting all the time. That guy over there, yawning while he jerks off at you gawkers, that his schtick. Most o’ the rest just sit around looking pathetic…
Don’t ya got something better to do than stare at me human? Get the fuck outta here ‘fore I chuck a turd at ya!
I felt bad then, that those monkeys had such limited lives, which zoo workers didn’t give a second thought to as the weuf about their rounds, feeding the animals, occasionally cleaning cages.
Maybe the monkeys didn’t care, I don’t know.
But, from inside this barren supermax box, without a T.V. or radio, with only a pen and paper allowed for art supplies, in a cell that has had multiple past occupants smear shit on the surfaces of, more occupants who jerked off at gawkers, I can relate to that angry monkey’s imagined thoughts.

I need my arm; I’m right handed for f─’s sake!” Greed was still M.I.A., maybe he’d offed like most of the woods suspected. Tonka was unaccounted for; probably offed himself too. S─ was that f─cking bad. How many times could a guy get stabbed before he just said, “f─ it all?” He hadn't figured it out yet. He was draining his elbow next to Plymouth Rock, lost in his own world of f─cking woe.
“I ever tell you,” said someone from behind him, “you cuss too f─cking much?”
Midget spun around, banging his legs against the boulder. Down he went along with his shank and gauze for drainage. Of all the people, there stood Greed; speak of the devil… Greed surveyed their surroundings then, he said, “Some on. Got meds for that and we got work to do. I’m getting us out.”
“Papá… Yo no puedo creerlo, no se puede ser verdadero, ¿no?” Victor’s warm breath was fogging the opaque glass compounding his disbelief. “Papá, esto no puede ser. I don’t believe it… a train…”
But that’s what it was a real, actual train. Not an old-fashioned, coal-burning chugger. More a commuter, high-tech electronics, self-propelled train. Only the heavy door separated him and Old Man Sanchéz from freedom. Victor’s fist pounded, his feet struck out, his voice raved; in short, he went beserk.
“Alrighty then,” said Murphy. ""He definitely looked the cat who ate the cream. The dying had slowed down, the wars had stopped, fools were starting to realize their last days could be spent trying to escape instead of finished old grievances. I was ‘healthy,’ meaning walking under my own power and had managed to bite my tongue long enough to have an ace or two to play. Now the time had come inside the admin’s offices. I’d figure it out the day you grabbed me in the library sleeping. It’s crazy nobody ever thought about it, you know?“
“Talk faster,” replied Murphy. It was simple. Obvious after you think hard on it. Teresa’d told them the helicopter only held eight people plus a three man flight crew, so eleven total, at max. Every morning there's only those flights arriving to Lucky Hole; 24 guards. But there's another fifty-odd-something employees and administrators and teachers and medical staff and personnel, Monday through Friday. Where did they all come from? Lucky Hole had no gates. Where did all the livestock and supplied and foodstuff come from? They only flew in guards or tours. I had Murphy’s full attention. He was buying any and everything I was selling, no questions asked. I finally said, “so I knew there had to be an underground road or highway. The boilers, heaters and a gang of other s─ is all underground, right? Out of the whole damned pinta, where the only place we never go?”
Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 12 by E.C. Theus-Roberts
Rafa still couldn’t believe it. Vic was desaparecido. Nobody’d even heard a whisper about him. Then, Gerogie too, had fallen into a void, un vacío profundo. He’d been gone even longer. Everyone’d though the worst: he’d walked the line under all hr stress. At least they’d believe it till Rafa told them about the elibrary. Ol’ Georgie Boy was built of stronger hierro that Mast knew, but Rafa knew. Rafa wanted to go back to the library, pick up the trial, Julio agreed. Eli couldn’t much else besides agree. He had to keep their plans in motion. Greed still had to die; Killer Keith’s clan was at the gates; Louie and Abdul needed to be dealt with. Plus, he still needed Manuel to hit the lick on medical ─ Murphy’s territory. Eli said, “dále qas pendejos. Just don’t f─cking disappear too, ¿no?” Manuel left with Julio and Rafa at dusk. They spilt ways outside the library, “cuidate compa.”
“You guys do the same,” said Manuel, seeping into the darkening shadows.
Murphy was floored. His mouth hung open as if I’d broken his jaw. For those few seconds I don’t even mind his halitosis. I might’ve grown two heads the way he was staring at me. I know it was only seconds but it could’ve been hours. I watched Murphy’s narrow, beady eyes. Watched his dull mind kick and sputter into action. Saw the wheels grinding after so much time inactive. I could even feel their straining against the dumb brute they were imprisoned in. It looked painful, but díos mío, I enjoyed it. Petty as hell but─
“So… you’re telling me…” Murphy was shaken, uncertain, “...you’re saying there really is an escape?”
“Yeah,” I said thinking, “God in Heaven let there be an escape from this hell hole.”
Victor awoke and sorry was he to do so. His throat felt raw and swollen. It was difficult to get a full breath. His arms felt leaden, same as his legs ─ just dead weight. His head soon followed, letting him know in binding, mind-splitting pain it was still attached, unfortunately. Then, he noticed the speckles of blood edging a couple of respectable sized pools at his sides. His last coherent thought, “I’m about to die.” His face met the uprushing concrete ground.
I’d lost all interest in Murphy the second I heard the first muted sounds. A fight? Sounded like a good one. Then, bodies thudded against the closed doors. Murphy jumped three feet out of his chair. Beggings, screams, plenty of cursing too. Murphy rushed to lock the door. It swung open. Tonka and Murphy faced off. The one smeared with blood, his shirt torn and his own blood dripping, weapon in hand. The other… Well, he looked like he’d just gave birth to triplets. Tonka rushed in, followed by two other woods armed with club and hammer. Murphy squealed, squealed like the stuck pig he was. I’d only heard a high-pitched shriek like that once in my life. The last thing I wanted was a reminder of Murphy's tender care. Yet, I sat there mesmerized as they stabbed him, clubbed and flattened his skull. Listened as the screamed cut short and the only sounds was Tonka’s knife driven hilt deep, pulled out in a sickening wet, meaty sound. I couldn’t have run if I’d needed to, all I could do was watch. Watch three men kill my tormentor. I’m ashamed to say it, but I’ve never been happier in my life. Yeah, I’ll have to go to confessions for this. If not, I’ll probably burst into flames if I step into another church.
The human body was an amazing thing. Its capacity for reselience surpassed all bounds of comprehension. While Murphy was true and dead. Victor, on the other hand, was alive, in pain and mad. After some four hours of unconsciousness he struggled upright, teetered a moment then, launched himself single-mindedly into the cracked glass door. He’d lost control, lost all cognizance, his world existed of the door and train and tracks beyond. Over and over, again and again. Pained, blinded by his tears, his strength flagging. He let loose a barbarian, savage outcry and rushed headlong.
“Georgie Boy,” said Greed, “you can thank Midget here for finding you…” I would’ve thanked the zombie of Houdini has he said so “...but now, I need your help…” His eyes were predatory, “which ways out?”
Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 13 by E.C. Theus-Roberts
There’s always somebody paying attention. Somehow, somebody always seems to find out in prison - is there no such thing as a secret? I’d gone from thankful and relieved to dread in a couple of words. What else had Midget, the good Samaritan, heard? Obvious, he’d heard me screaming about escape; it’s why I was surrounded by gabachos, reminded me of a military tribunal or something. Did I want to risk my life twice on a hunch? Uh, duh, f─ no! So, I did the only thing I could do.
Abdul looked grimey. He felt worse, caked with days of old dirt, mud, dried blood, sweat and just filth. He dragged himself from their headquarters, slowing marching toward the washroom. Washing with hand sanitizer was a serious chore. It irritated the scabs, compounded the rashes in sensitive areas and left a residue that seemed to attract more dirt and grime. They couldn’t shave, even if they wanted to, there were no razors. Besides, there wasn’t anybody to be presentable for. Their water supply was low, lower still than they’d planned with all the injured and sick they now had. There were dissenters daily, hourly. The war was over for them, but a select few maintained a fatalistic determination. Looking at the stranger in the mirror, Abdul said, “great and merciful Allah, let me take as many of them I can with me.”
Desperation has a way of driving people beyond all bounds of ingenuity. Julio said, “Mira, I’m looking at it like this...they only shoot at the line,” a history book between them, “you walk the line and bang! ¿No?”
“Sí, desde luego, pero yo no lo sé acerca de esto…”
“No me des nada de ─”
“Julio! Julio, Rafa!” came somebody’s shout. Julio was out of his chair spinning to face the threat. Rafa was quicker being on wheels. They were shoulder to hip when Manuel came in with the whole gang.
“What ─” said Rafa.
“Them blancos just slaughtered Murphy and Georgie’s there too. I guess Murphy kidnapped him and ─” Manuel stopped short as Rafa and Julio rushed past.
Victor was dead, or at least wished he was. Glass shards, blood all dried making him look like a thorny lizard. The pain burst in on him, overwhelming his senses. Tears burned in his eyes where slivers of glass had embedded themselves. He looked at the door forbidding him freedom. ‘I’ve failed,’ thought Victor. The pain was too much. He dismayed, cursing the Heavens making his pain tenfold. Exhausted, he cleared his wounded eyes of glass. He blinked ten, twenty, fifty times in disbelief. He was staring down the hallway lit with a sickly yellow glow. Behind him was the train, before him was hell. The train, he’d made it; he hadn’t failed. Victor sat lost in what to do next. It was an hour and forty minutes later when he came back to his senses. The train was chugging along at a nice, sedate pace, its air conditioning blowing sweetly, stirring the quiet. Alone. Alone, after so many years of never being alone, having no privacy, not even to sleep. The quiet was deafening.
“Go back,” said the tiny voice in his head, “go back. Don’t leave your brother. What about Georgie?”

I’m gonna fly, like a hurricane whiskin’ through seashells…
destroying coral reefs…
Beneath the midnight-blue clouds, I’m gonna fly…
into the darkness that you’ve left behind
Where there’s nothing to see… nothing to hear… nothing to say…
For the words have all been spoken…
Through the silent rage that’s so loud… that its
presence is like turbulence that I run to…
just trying to see you again somehow…
Because I…
am not confused: ‘tis I, beneath the
starry sky…
Breathless…
as I fly…
Between the secrets of two planes, as your soul
sheds a body…
only to be hindered… and imprisoned in
some type of—
Purgatory-like hell… while its female half
maintains its fear… of closure
For one soul is equal halves: male, female… and the
dominance of a world so cold
upon
its
female...
half...
Is so utterly frustrating… that he….
Flies…
Like the
blindingly blue black swirls that unfurl…
The child curls… like angel wings in top speed
flight...
While a mother shows a daughter a… solo…
Shooting star… of light… tonight…
Which is nothing less than alpha male…
As he flies…
below the astral plane, just enough…
To wonder why…
the rest of humanity… would trade…
Body…
at the price of wings…
(And then)
The last time I saw Bryan… he gave me coffee because I was asking him to come to the N.A. meeting with me… We talked some… He let me know where he was at…
And he died that night, while I was at the N.A. meeting… dropped dead in the shower… he didn’t know that “monster” out there? He was real....

Through their pleadings to upper level administration we were able to offer “adult enrichment” programs to our fellow felons. The most popular “classes” were drawing/art, graphic novel design, creative writing (short stories, novels, etc.), and a poetry workshop. In each case the curriculum was designed by the prisoner who subsequently conducted the course. I was lucky enough to benefit from those programs both as a student and as an instructor. Sadly, these programs “died on the vine” when one of the teachers retired and the other transferred to another position. Their replacements were unwilling to expend the effort required to continue the project. But, it was a truly beneficial run while it lasted for which I am extremely thankful.
I won’t bore you with the hundreds, if not thousands, of those other “simple things” that boiled to the surface of memory from before and after entering prison for which I am thankful. I will, however, express my thanks to each and every one of my fellow authors whose insights on assigned topics/photos are always stimulating. Also, there must be a standing ovation and an endless round of applause for the staff and volunteers at Prisoner Express who make all of this possible.

Really though, this is used for correctness in how those same actions are in place.
More in detail, try to keep a steady amount of accomplishments. That is good and very well. Because to continue with confidence on the face is one in itself. That also helps him or her to see goals too.
My own examples of such accomplishments are very grand. I can share these. Having graduated high school after failing countless tests in the process. But the accomplishment was not just completing but how that did happen. There was the mountain to climb. Transportation became a major problem. That was solved, but add one one more to the list of accomplishments. Next accomplishment was a job at the same time. Yes, I kept stacking until the goal was reached. That new car had payments due and gas had to be filled. THat means first do what needs to be done just to graduate. Get here everyday. Make it back and forth to work and keep being ready to make another new accomplishment. That happened.
Another one for me is my solo career, from leaving (or being removed) from a group that was shy and unsettled. After the first project happened I had to produce a second on my own. That was accomplished. In short, there are many and don’t forget one to add to the list…
It is good to have a positive, motivated drive. That is said well. That makes easy communication though at times we can be misunderstood. Keep moving to the next. I shared here a small one and then a large one. Those are examples. As the days continue there is a flow of them waiting to be done correctly. They even link. Share them with yourself or those willing to hear. Keep a list for your own goodness. Well in the mind or even paper. Correctness. Plan for another: Duplicate. That is important. Remember what they look like because it’s not good to forget them, even when feeling the heat.
Take each section here and get a real good idea of what I am saying, because hopefully that will be a great accomplishment too.

However, the guard told us that being at CFRC will not affect our good adjustment transfer. So that was one relief. But that was it.
Adjustment to this new environment was touch and go for me. After about six months, I was finally acclimated to the constant shake downs, petty guards, fussing and fighting, noise, cigarette smoke (smoked with Bible paper or paper towels), K2 smoke (synthetic marajana that smells like burning tires), and a myriad of other things coalesced into the ambient hum of the place.
I tried to join programs. But there weren’t any except Christian programs and I’m not a Christian. So I tried to start an art program but there was no venue to begin one. So I concentrated more on my own craft. I’ve become better with my portrait art and all the other styles of drawing became relatively easy. A year and a half goes by with the same everyday mundane rituals, with my transfer still pending and my mind begging to be elsewhere.
And then one day, it happened. It was late August when I was called back to the dorm to pack my property and report to T&R (Transient and Reception).
Finally! I thought. My prayers have been answered, I’m getting out of here! But then, I thought, this is the afternoon and the timing for a transfer was kind of strange. Yet, I still thought I was being transferred to one of my approved institutions. When I arrived at T&R with a smile on my face and property in hand, I was told that I was being moved to the South Unit.
I had no idea of what I was in store for. I’ve heard of the south unit, but was never given an accurate description of the place itself, so I approached the situation with a little bit of trepidation.
I arrived at the south unit and was amazed at the set-up, there was only 70 men living there on the compound and with the 5 that came with me, that brought the total to 85 inmates with the 10 in the infirmary waiting to die. I believed that my wishes and prayers were answered.
It was very nice at first. I had a 3 man room all by myself with a shared bathroom with my only neighbor. My room door opened to the outside, we could sit outside on the benches at night and talk on the phone from one til late night. We even had weekend modern movies. It was a really nice place to be to finish up your time or your life, if you were a lifer. It was what I was wishing for, but after 6 months of this, it started to become not only boring but a very lonely place for me.
One day after receiving some really good news and wanting to share it with someone I could trust with personal matters, I looked around for someone and I looked at room doors at the clusters of people standing and sitting around in different areas, and noticed that there was no one I could talk to that I could trust enough to talk about personal things.
And that’s when I knew that this was not the best place for me. This is a prime example of the adage: be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.
So when life gives you what you want, make the best of it. Because that place was a really nice facility for some people, but not for me. Now that I am no longer there, a part of me longs to be there and a part of me doesn’t. I’ll just wish for something in between."

I tell her if I don’t like the answers for questions one and two then three is irrelevant. She looks like she’s about to scream so I punch her hard enough to knock her out but probably not kill her.
I get back in the car. I find a baggie of shards in my pocket so I make myself a shot. I shoot.
I don’t know how I got here but I’m driving on the trail again. I stop at a red light and a minivan pulls up next to me. There’s a kid staring at me from the backseat with mickey mouse ears on his head. I stifle the urge to get out and punch him in his stupid face when he sticks his tongue out at me. Doesn’t he know I’m a fucking rockstar? The light turns green so I hit the gas instead of him.
The night is full of terrors. I pull over because the hallucinations are hitting hard now. A zombie walks up to the window and asks for a dollar. I jump in the backseat and lay on the floor to hide from him. I hear music. Kendrick Lamar says Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe when I notice the Samsung under the seat. The screen says it’s my brother Mitch. I hit the answer button and a voice says I need to tell it where I am. That it will forgive me if I bring back its car. That I can keep the money as long as it's wife doesn’t find out what I’ve done. That it wants me to go to rehab. The voice is pissing me off. I hang up on it.
Kendrick starts rapping again but I ignore him this time. There’s something I still need to do...some loose end that needs to be tied...ah that girl.
I decide to give her to the zombie. When I got out of the car I see gime next to a bicycle laden with overstuffed
Hefty bags. I wave him over flashing my most charming meth mouth smile as I open the trunk and tell him I have something for him. He’s apprehensive but eager for a handout. This zombie is clearly homeless. The girl isn’t in the trunk–only the withered vinyl skin sack stares at me, her mouth forming a perfect o.
I can tell by his face that he has fallen in love. He ties his limp lover to the garbage sack and pedals away muttering sweet nothings into her partially chewed ear along the way.
I'm not as bothered as I probably should be by the disappearance of the other girl. Maybe she was never there but just in I used my pocket flashlight to scour every inch of the trunk for her. I find several possible shards and a spent bic lighter but no girl. Grateful the situation has resolved itself. I get back in the driver’s seat.
Hours of tweaking apps while I’m stuck in this spot. I have seventeen missed calls and one very long text message. I’m such a fucking loser. I’ve relapsed again. I’ve stolen from my brother again. I should get help. I should call Mitch and beg for forgiveness. I’m such a fuck up. I’m hopeless. I should kill myself and save my family the heartache of watching me fail time after time.
I pull the bag of crystal out of my pocket. Do I want to be a loser or a fucking astronaut. I choose outer space over real life any day and reach for the needle under my seat."

I can rifle though every memory I have and won’t find a single one of them together or happy. To the contrary, they truly hated one another. Being a product of that chaos made my life hell. In a way, their hatred for each other fell on me. I guess each one saw part of the other in me, which made them hate parts of me. It rang especially true when it came to actions. My mother dated a lot of abusive men, of all types. Where I’d be six years old through ten years old trying to fight them off of her, she wouldn’t show the same care by letting them actually turn on me. In a way, I always thought she did nothing because she saw my father in me and enjoyed seeing him get beat. For my father, it was utter neglect. I can count on both hands how many times he’s told me he loved me. Then, on my toes I can count how many times he’d told me I was a mistake while he was drunk.
Ultimately, this all led to them discarding me like a piece of unneeded furniture while in my teens. It was on eto the other, and then on my own far sooner than I was prepared for.
The strange part is that I never stopped loving them. I never resented them or hated them. All I wanted was to have them love me and be proud of me. Despite being in prison, I believe I’m okay despite being the product of such chaos. I love them and that’s a pesky thing. Sure, I wish they were better, like the love of my life and soulmate who is the most amazing mother I’d ever seen. But, we can’t have everything
Yes, I love my parents unconditionally. Before my father passed, which was sudden, I would’ve thought I’d take it well. However, when I got the news I cried like a six year old and my legs gave out. Part of me died, and I still feel that. Now, knowing my mother isn’t far behind hurts and I try to prepare myself, but there is no prep for that. I love her and I miss her already.
My only solace is that I picture them still at each other’s throats in Heaven, being restrained by the angels.
I love you Mom and Dad."

We can find several scriptures of this dependence of God and his ability to provide.
Gen. 2:9 - The Trees for food to Adam and Eve
Ex 15:23 - Made bitter water sweet
Ex 16:4 - Rained break from Heaven
Numb - 20:8 - Water from a rock
Num - 11:5 - Provided vegetables to eat
Luke 5:5-6 - Filled Simon’s fishing net with fish
Matt 14:13-21 - Jesus fed 5,000
Mark 8:1-10 - Jesus fed 4,000
My point is this: trust in the Lord and he will provide for your needs just as he did in (JOB 24:5) God provided food to them in the wilderness, God will provide for us!

See, we no longer have to eat scraps anymore. We can feast on all the eggs we want from their chicken house.”
Mrs. Fox was not impressed. “The farmer and his family have been kind to us. They give us food and don’t chase us away. Why do we need to steal from them?”
“Mrs. Fox,” he belittled her. “You do not see the big picture. They feed us scraps, but keep their prized eggs for themselves. If they were truly kind, they would also share their eggs, too.”
Mrs. Fox did not see quite like Mr. Fox did, but did not argue anymore. She left him with his big egg. Sitting with the wicker doll carriage, Mr. Fox tried to think of a way to enjoy his new treat. Climbing into the carriage, he tried to bite the shell, but it was much too hard. He pawed at it, but the shell was much too smooth. Growing tired, Mr. Fox curled around his prize, dreaming of the golden treasure inside.
Early the next morning, Mr. Fox was awakened by crackling coming from the shell. Leaping out of the carriage, he waited for the next surprise. A new born chick would be more satisfying than a gooey yolk, he thought.
“Cheep, cheep.” A yellow head popped through the cracked shell. Mr Fox’s eyes grew wide with delight. All the possibilities with his own chicken… a new idea sparked in his head.
“What is that noise?” Mrs. Fox exclaimed as she climbed out from their oak tree burrow. “It’s… it’s a chick!”
“It hatched,” Mr. Fox stated triumphantly.
“Are you going to eat it?” she asked. “It’s awfully big for a baby chicken.”
“I have a better idea!” Mr. Fox stated enthusiastically. “If the farmer can raise chickens, we can too. With our very own chicken, we can eat all the eggs we want!”
As before, Mrs. Fox did not argue, but took no part in Mr. Fox’s scheme. Each night, they collected their scraps and Mr. Fox fed his chicken. And the chicken grew… and grew… and grew. So big, in just a few weeks, it barely fit in the wicker doll carriage. Refusing to let his chicken roam free, Mr. Fox pushed his chicken everywhere. Soon they had to make multiple trips to feed his baby.
Mr. Fox’s chicken soon was no longer a baby, but it still demanded all of his attention. At night when it was hungry, it would let out a loud “HONK” until he pushed the carriage to the scrap pile. If Mr. Fox ignored his chicken, it pecked his head. If Mr. Fox was angry at it, it bit his tail. Mr. Fox pushed his chicken everywhere it wanted to go, but he knew he would eventually get his reward.
One night, the Miller family were out early on their porch, when the seven year old Miller girl cried out in delight to her mother. “Look Mommy,” pointing to Mr. Fox pushing the wicker doll carriage. “That daddy fox is pushing that big, boy goose in my old baby carriage.”"

Everyone’s been staking out that lake since cameras were invented. Yet only now you has been lucky enough to capture a photo of one of the most famous legends in the history of the world. Really?”
“Well...uh...well yes,” she answered. “I guess I am lucky.”
The editor stared at her for several seconds before going on. “You know, it strokes me that the timing of all of this is more then a little suspicious…” he said, never taking his eyes off of her.
She stretched her long neck a little farther and learned toward the editor. “And what’s that supposed to mean?” she asked with just the slightest edge of defiance in her voice.
“Oh, so I guess we are going to just pretend that you were not just standing in this office one week ago being warned by me that if you don’t stop hanging out at that lake and instead start bringing me something I can actually write about, something newsworthy, I was just going to put you on the classified ad ‘typing pool’”.
“Yes, yes, but I swear this had nothing to do with that. It was just a coincidence. Serendipity. Ok, so I was at the lake, but I was there because I wanted to get a photo of the freshwater barnacles that I had heard were so hard to ger off of your tail. I thought if I could get a really graphic picture of that you could write a great ‘Your Health’ piece about it. So I had already had my camera out, and I happened to look towards the shore where that dock is, and there it was, just sitting there. It’s the scoop of the century, I tell ya!”
She looked off into space as if she were reading a billboard. “Photographic Proof That Humans Exist!” it would say. That headline alone will sell a lot of papers. But then-BAM!” She made a rectangular frame in the air. “My beautiful photo, front and center… You could interview a cryptozoologist and then interview me as an eyewitness. Sir, this is history we are making! It will put us all on the map. Everyone in all of Scotland will buy our paper, I tell ya!” she exclaimed.
“Or they will stop at the torch store on their way down here to run us out of town for being CRACKPOTS!”
The editor thought for a moment. “Maybe if we had a few more photos… a close-up, maybe. Something showing its face… But with just one picture… Now, it’s just too risky.”
This was all the opening she needed. “Well then I think it’s clear what I must do. I’m just going to have to swim right back down to the end of the loch with my camera, stick my head up out of the water, and snap the photo that’s going to win me the Pulitzer. I won’t come back until I have irrefutable photo graphic evidence that humans are real. As real as you and me!” she said.
“You do that, Nessie, you do that,” the editor replied. But he was not convinced."

But even through the process of recovery, a part of me, my soul, was still lingering in the fog. Last year that fog began to lift. I had somehow found, against all odds and logic, in the most try of circumstances and in the most unlikely of places, that one special someone who truly touched my heart and soul.
This is not meant to be a “love story.” Well, at least not in the traditional sense. But it is a story of guy meets girl, guy falls for girl and like in Romeo and Juliet, the union is taboo. How can a friendship be banned? So this is the story of how my heart became attached to hers by both respect and affection. It is a story about how she waivers and rejects friendship because of an archaic ethical code which she feels prohibits even the slightest amount of communication. Will she choose an antiquated unenforceable guideline over my heart?
I am currently reading “The Art of Seduction” by Robert Greene. I chose this book as a sort of reference text. I was hoping to gain insight into her psyche, and truthfully perhaps gain some type of advantage in our impasse. What I found was that my “would-be-friend” falls under the category of a Coquette. (This definition is not simply “a flirt” because that she is not!). But rather: “Coquettes are grand masters of the game (of seduction). They orchestrate a back and forth movement between hope and frustration. The coquette alters between heat and coolness with willful precision, keeping you at their heels. She is an enigma. Sometimes she seems somewhat frigid and straight-laced, and at other times she’s tantalizingly smoldering. But the bottom line is that I am only seeking her perpetual friendship.
In my heart of hearts I know that this is my one great opportunity to achieve a lifelong, mutually beneficial, loyal, and unwavering friendship. She has lifted me out of the fog and has placed my head back in the clouds. My old fears are creeping back in. Maybe this wasn’t meant to be my cloud after all? I am bewildered by her. I am not looking for any more growth here. I don’t want or need a new lesson. All I need is a friend. I need my cloud nine."

The muted black, brown and grey fur of their coats blend perfectly with the ambient terrain, making the wolves all but invisible to the unsuspecting deer below.
On cue, like a well-honed military team, the wolves deploy. Down the hill by degrees, some fan left, others fan right to form an inconspicuous noose around the still-browsing herd. The old matriarch shifts nervously from foot to foot as the ambush unfolds; a slight wag of her tail signals her approval of the pack’s tactics. To and fro, the wolves trot gradually tightening the noose around the deer.
The wolves’ bodies are long and lean, sturdy and powerful; their eyes are alert and keen, and show intelligence. These are living demons.
Step-by-step, the attack develops. Then, in a flash, with savage speed and terror, the kill is on. The deer never see it coming."

Reyes, a very nervous and hyper person to begin with, took extreme offense at my getting to familiar with his computer. Instead of submitting to the suggestion of an inferior, he snapped, “you know what you did! You had to sign for your write-up! You are not some 14 year old boy…!”
Now Reyes has set me off, since I am the king of sarcasm. I interrupt him loudly, “You guards are in charge of telling me what you have written on papers you insist that I sign! Tell me what it is or remove it if you want me to sign!”
Reyes went nuts at my “sass”. He began bellowing for me to leave. I went back to the cage and wrote about this incident to the director after the kops simply ignored 3 requests to staff on his incompetence, insolence, and inability to follow his training on how to “defuse” instead of instigating incidents.
While I was going out of my way to help Reyes become a less explosive kop, the ACA came by to “inspect” the place. (The American Correctional Association isa group of kops who “certify” prisons in return for annual payment of dues, apparently.)
We got 3 days worth of much better chow out of the deal. On the last day, one of the inspectors took over Reye’s office and sent him to come get me for an exclusive, private interview. (Three weeks before, a scared female stranger showed up at each of these mini prisons to post an ACA notice and run away before too large of a group of stalkers gathered to mob her. One of the horndog kids shouted at her “why don't you come all the way in here and post it on the bulletin board over there?!” She made a threat that the bulletin board would be removed soon, then hurriedly made her escape). Reyes was very curious as to the woman’s interest in me. (Only days ago, the director had sent one of GEO’s lieutenant kops to interview me on my written complaint against Reyes. No doubt, Lt. Inserra had “investigated” Reyes too.) Like a sly snake, he innocently asked, “you were expecting this?” as if we were pals now.
I had no idea what these kops were up to, and I told him so. He did not believe mee, mostly because I made him wait. I grabbed a folder that held all the paperwork that I had put on Reyes, hoping that it was the reason for the ACA woman wanting to talk to me.
It wasn’t. Instead, she wanted to talk about one of the 17 letters I sent to various government agencies, politicians, media outlets, and civil rights organizations over 19 months complaining about the food. The kops stole all the fruit from our diet because of a few alcoholics determined to rot-up something to drink. They’ve been so successful at it that the wardens are spreading this illegal mass-punishment nonsense to all of their other prisons. So she listened. Afterward, I got the idea of throwing a mandamus on the FDA over the unhealthy, inadequate diet, and the FTC over the canteen price gouging that violates the Clayton Act. I’m sure that this is the best, most efficient, legal, way for me to keep helping out!"
2027,“Half” by Seth E.,,Yes,2019.0,11 - November,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Girl-Looking-through-Window-6fcdae9133d449fa9755e7dbc8ecb2ea,Anna Nguyen,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwOk6bdzDr9jBWw0tYX72CR-fws_yEfvqF1i_h-d4f0/edit,No,"As she ascended, Lilly thought of all the horrible things men had said and done over the years, wondering what it was that made men like that. She’d been leered at, touched, groped, pinched, yelled at, spit on, called hundreds of sick or demeaning things, followed, threatened, prepositioned, and generally abused just about every day of her life since the age of 11. THe list of crap she’ put up with, ignored, ran from, been assaulted with, and scared of, was so long she could never put a number on a total. And that didn’t even count the subtler sexism that she’d always experienced, mostly from men, but even from other women.
Locking the door behind her, as she finally entered her apartment, Lilly realized that she locked herself into her own home because of these problems. Because of men, she was always defending herself, taking preventative measures, modifying and shaping her behavior to account for how men behaved.
Car keys held like a weapon. Check the backseat before I get in the car. Don’t go out alone at night. Always adjusting jogging routes to avoid problem areas like a construction site. Locking the door when I came in, and making sure it’s still locked when I came home. Being careful not to drink too much.Don’t leave my drink and come back to it -- and watch it being made. Carry mace. Have a private number, unlisted. Use the automated voicemail voice so it’s not a woman’s voice. Park in well-lit areas and avoid garages. Don’t get into elevators with groups of men or only one man (not that i t can be avoided if he gets on after me). Don’t take a first floor apartment. Use a home alarm system. Don’t make eye contact with men on the street. Vary my route home. Don’t use highway rest areas. Put my hair under a hat…
Even after all this, Lilly still felt vulnerable, threatened. SHe had taken those classes on rape prevention, but they seemed like a fantasy idea. Besides, she knew that the “stranger in the bushes jumps out to rape lone jogger” notion was mostly a myth -- the vast majority of rapes were by people known to each other, or even by partners. It’s all well and good to train yourself to react to being grabbed in the park, but what are you going to do when you wake up to your boyfriend penetrating you while you sleep? Or when a guy gets “grabby” when you’re at a party? Self defense classes don’t cover what to do if your best friend’s boyfriend tries to kiss you and grab your breast in the hallway at her birthday party.
Looking down on the city, the people in the buildings, the pedestrians, the cars… Lilly realized a weird thing about her fears: after her wreck, she’d been scared of big trucks; but after that night in high school… she’d been scared of half the population. And that fear had never left.
A sudden thought occurred to her: I’ve always said “I was raped in high school”, but never “Dillan raped me when I was fifteen”! Why don’t we talk about the problem of men? No, it’s always rape as a “women’s issue”, isn’t it?
And Lilly began to look at herself anew, intentionally setting aside the way she evaluated herself, her life, as a woman for men. Just looked at herself as a person.
Lilly had a feeling she might have something else to say, a different reaction now, in any more elevator rides. She got out her phone, called the building manager and prepared to describe the “thing” that happened in the elevator. Lilly was done being scared. She was going to stand up for her half."

I nodded understanding and headed to the mini mart that was connected to the gas station...I stepped in, went to the counter and purchased one Mega Million Jackpot lottery ticket just in case the lady was right. I stuck it into my wallet then went to the small cafe across the street where a few of the passengers were already exiting.
I ordered a hamburger special, it said $3.29 and consisted of a burger, fries, and coke...it arrived faster than expected...I looked at the paintings and pictures that covered the walls of the smaller diner and saw that they were all U.F.O themed and I realised I was in Roswell…
I sat at the counter and enjoyed my lunch. It was now 12:20 PM and the day was turning out to be a scorcher...after eating I headed back to the bus realizing that I was the last to get on, by the looks of scorn from other restless passengers who were ready to continue on with their journey.
I was currently unemployed, in debt, freshly divorced paying child support for a 12 year old girl and a 8 year old boy, my savings were at an all time low, but still for some reason, I felt at peace. I still had to ride through Texas, then into Louisiana, to New Orleans then up to my destination which was Shreveport, Louisiana where my aging uncle and aunt lived on our family's 24 acre old decrepit farm, with most of the 24 acres being swampland...it boasted 2 horses, 2 cows, 9 pigs, about 100 chickens, a small orchard of peach and plum trees, a strawberry patch, a cornfield and a garden of lettuce collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, carrots, string beans, onions and potatoes…
They could no longer afford to hire help, so I had volunteered to come and visit and do the repair work on the fences, pens, coops, and everything else that was falling apart or falling down…
The bus rolled smoothly and its air conditioner held up nicely as the sun, now in full bloom assaulted the day. We reached a Texas town hours later and that is when all hell broke loose…
As we got out to stretch and patronize a subway restaurant, a Krispy Kreme donut stand and a mini mart we heard gunshots...much too many gunshots...and much too closely for comfort...many ran back into the bus, while I stood frozen like a deer in the headlights, trying to see who was doing the shooting and who they were shooting at...why? I don't know, it was not my business...was I trying to be a star witness? Of course not...Was i trying to get shot? No way, but still I stood there...the next thing I saw took my breath away, I saw an all black S.U.V full of men barreling down the road towards us, and at the same time, a small girl, who looked to be around 8 years old stood from behind one of the mini mart's trash cans and attempted to run into the Krispy Kreme donut stand where her mom and lil brother were...now, don't get to thinking that she had a bad or neglectful mom, because she didn't...her mom had happened to be carrying her lil brother when the shooting started, and instinctively ran into the bakery for cover...knowing, hoping and praying that her daughter was close on her heels...she was wrong. Her daughter had chosen to duck behind a trash can and had a stray bullet come that way, the plastic trash can couldn't of been any help or protection and now that the shooting had temporarily stopped, she felt it was her chance to make a dash for the donut stand, but fate had other plans and the SUV, slammed into the girl, knocking her about 20 feet where she slid into a gas pump and crumbled there unconscious, the truck never stopped, but instead it sped away with another car which looked to be a Crown Victoria which were commonly used by DEA agents on or around the border, close behind it, in a cops and robbers good chasing evil kinda display… the shoot out appeared to be over, but so did the life of the little girl. I was a first responder, the first person to reach her, since I had been the only one standing and watching hte tragedy transpire first hand...the first thing I noticed was her shin bone broken and sharp and sticking out of the skin of her leg...then I noticed blood coming out of her nose and mouth, maybe indicating internal bleeding...I stooped down next to her crumbled body, and saw how her neck protruded from her body. It was broken...and I somehow knew that there would be no more birthdays and Christmas mornings in her future. I subconsciously touched the pendant around my neck and thought about all of the good luck I somehow knew it would bring me...a new home, debt paid off, possibly get my wife and family back, a new job, a good one, a new car and so many other good and lucky things that life and the pendant could and would bring me...then I looked at the little girl and instinctively knew what I had to do...now I knew why I purchased the pendant, it was for this precise moment in time...I gently tugged at the thin chain and it easily broke and dropped into my hand...I then gently put it into the little girl's hand and closed her little fingers around it. I closed my eyes as if to say a silent prayer. But as I held the little girl's hand, images appeared in my mind as if they were a motion picture...images of the little girl playing and laughing, holding up a high school diploma, then going to college...she wanted to be a doctor...I saw her in medical school studying and living and thriving, then I could feel her little hand move inside of mines...I opened my eyes and saw her looking at me...the blood that had been pouring out of her nose and mouth was now dry and resembled coffee, a bulge no longer protruded from her neck, I glanced down at her leg...it was as smooth as the day she was born...a bone no longer poked out of her skin…
I guess while I was taking a guided tour of her life, she was taking one of mines. She whispered, ""Thank you sir, I know what you did!!!"". Her mother and then many others ran over to where she lay, she slowly sat up...she was fine...she opened her and and the chain was still there, but the leaf was now a fine brown powder in the palm of her hand...I had given her my luck, my chance at redemption, finally being rich, a man of means, financially secure...but you know what? I felt that allowing that beautiful innocent little girl to die, for the sake of some money? Was not an option...sometimes the heart overrides the mind on matters of importance, and this was one time I was glad that I did…
Nobody knew how close that little girl was to death other than me and her and God, and whatever power it was that had manifested itself in the leaf...but still I could hear murmurs of how it was a ""miracle"" as I headed back to the bus…
We continued on our journey, I got off of that particular bus in Louisiana, no doubt I would never see that beneficiary of my good luck ever again...and would lose no sleep over what took place that eventful midmorning in New Mexico and Texas.
I took another bus up through Louisiana, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lafayette and eventually Shreveport, made it to my family's farm, helped fixed the place up, never even mentioned what had happened, I don't think nobody would've believed it no way…
And then on the morning I had planned to leave my uncle and aunt and go back to California, about $1,000 richer… I sat in the living room watching a morning news show, and one of the anchors was talking about the one lucky winner of the Mega Millions Jackpot and how no one still hadn't called in or went in to claim their prize...I knew then that I coulda been that person once upon a time, but what I chose to do was worth more to me than that winning ticket...seriously, I meant that...the girl I saved would become a doctor and no telling how many lives would be saved by her hands…
The news anchor continued on saying that the sole winner had purchased the ticket at a Valero mini mart in New Mexico about a month prior to that day...well, I had been at the farm for about a month...then I remembered...aw hell no...it couldn't be...I went for my wallet and rummaged through it finding the ticket I had purchase that day, $326 million? Ain't that much luck in the planet...and as the news anchor read off the winning numbers I smiled from ear to ear...I had won the lotto…
So what i the moral to the story? We oftentimes ignore or dismiss old people or those who appear down on their luck, homeless...and instead we focus on the new shiny things and places and people...and we put too much emphasis on material things, instead of what's truly the most fragile tangible and important thing on this planet...LIFE...and when you do the right thing, it'll always come back to you, that's how the universe works...Believe it or not!"
2030,“The Big Heist” by Douglas Knakmuhs,,No,2019.0,05 - May,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Fox-Pushing-Duck-in-Basket-picture-7ca32868b1f246bfa2f0ba32e68ef5e4,Anna Nguyen,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/12qDXbLfqXcZ3GGSscI7Mi7lkDuN1YKGIt-ifZkWAULs/edit,No,"“I know, but I’m starting to shed, and what if the stress is too much and I have no feathers left by the time we get to the store? Then what do we do?” Mr Fiddlesticks asked, while he cried.
“I’ll tell you what, Duck. If you ain’t got any feathers left by the time we get there, then we’ll turn around, go home, and you can shave a mohawk into my fur. Okay? Quit yakking, will ya?! You’re gonna make us late!”
Ducky continued to agonize over the part he was supposed to play. He just knew he was going to mess up somehow. If it wasn’t his feathers falling out, then it was going to be his gas that gave them away. He had bad luck.
They entered the pet store with thirty minutes left until closing time.
“Alright, Ducky, this is perfect! We got a mom and two kids at the cash register keeping the owner busy,” Foxy stated, as he pushed the cart towards the puppy section. “Just remember, take deep calming breaths, and this’ll be over in no time.”
“I know, but I’m really nervous, and I already lost two feathers!” Ducky exclaimed.
“Just remember, my friend, we’re doing these puppies a favor by setting them free,” the fox reminded Ducky.
At that same moment, one of the kids noticed Mr. Redd and Mr. Fiddlesticks, as they continued making their way to the puppy cage.
“Mom, can I have that duck?” The little boy asked.
“What duck, sweetie?” The mom asked, as she counted out her money to give to the store owner.
“The one in the cart!” The little boy said.
“Hey, I want the fox mom!” Said the little boy’s sister.
It was at this moment that Mr. Fox noticed the children’s keen interest in him and Mr. Fiddlesticks. He tried to hide the cart behind the puppy cage, but the little boy and girl refused to be deterred. To them it was a game of “Hide and Seek.” Then, the kids split up so that they could approach from both sides.
“We gotcha now!” The little girl screamed as they grabbed ahold of Redd and Ducky.
“Abort the mission! Abort the mission!” Mr. Fox screamed as the girl gave him a big bear hug.
“I got you now, and you’re all mine!” Screamed the little girl as she squealed with delight. She continued to giggle as she petted Mr. Fox.
“Mr. Fiddlesticks, gas these kids, and let’s scram!” Cried Mr. Fox.
But at that moment, the little boy was trying to ride poor Mr. Fiddlesticks like he was a bucking bronco at a rodeo. All Ducky could do was flap his little wings, sending feathers everywhere.
“Help! I need help on aisle two,” Ducky squacked as he tried to get away, but the little boy had a death grip around Ducky’s neck.
By now, the mother had run over to them, and she was swinging her purse at Mr. Redd and Mr. Fiddlesticks as she screamed, “Police! Someone call the police!”
Even the store owner was getting in on the action with a broom stick he had in his hands. He must have played baseball on the weekends because he had a heck of a swing on him. Back and forth the broom went until it finally knocked over the puppy cage, and puppies began to scatter everywhere.
It was at this point that the little children let go of Foxy and Ducky with a squeal of delight and began to chase after the puppies. Mom and the store owner continued to pummel the two intruders as they tried to run for their lives.
And that was when Mr. Fiddlesticks decided to pass gas. It was a silent one, but it was very effective. The humans all turned green and started gagging!
“Let’s get out of here, Ducky!” panted Foxy as the puppies followed them out the door. On and on they ran, and as they ran for the woods, twenty-seven puppies continued to chase after them. Into the woods they went. Eventually, they came to rest at a place in the woods that they both knew. They looked around at all the puppies and smiled.
“See, Mr. Fiddlesticks, I told you there was nothing to it,” he said as he began to laugh like never before.
And so went the “Big Heist of 2018.”"

And you cannot forget Thanksgiving as a time of great food and family bonding.
I believe that holidays are mainly a source of unity for a group of people. It brings them together and gives them a sense of identity as a nation, country, religious or ethnic group. And this unity promotes all manners of attitudes and beliefs that help them form a cohesive whole as a distinct group. This provides them with a shared cultural background rich in what they believe is the right way.
Today, in this matter, as people have more access to knowledge and other cultures, it is possible to take what you see are the good parts of many different systems and create the right one for you. This has already happened in the past to create every social system and religion, except that they absorbed this knowledge and practices over centuries and millennia. Now it is at a much faster rate of decades or year years.
Why wouldn’t you take the best, disregard the worst, and generalize or specialize the rest to get an eclectic system that works better and has better results, and with the advance of science and technology, we have so much more to learn and pass on and actually have proof of its veracity. You no longer have to blindly follow superstitions, myths, and legends, but have historical and archeological accounts, histories we can now translate, and a better understanding of how life and nature work.
All of this we express through the choice of what holidays we promote and partake in celebration of; most people do so without consciously realizing it and by raising their children with it, they pass it on to future generations where it will be built upon even more to fit new times and needs, all with its primary purpose of holding together and unifying a group left intact.
So pretty much what I am saying is that holidays are a social tool, which no matter how much they change, they still have the same purpose and that as such are a major part of social fabric, no matter the culture or religion. That is why many people celebrate holidays they do not understand or even believe in and why commercial exploitation of these holidays only binds people together more.
Holidays are fun and sometimes stressful, but the meaning behind them, no matter how lost in obscurity, will still work under unification and will be perpetuated until even our modern descriptions are no more. They are a part of human nature we cannot give up.
Now if I can just get my birthday its own spotlight on the calendar, I would be set. Too bad there is already another holiday on its day, Columbus Day."
2034,“Fear Babies” by Jevon Jackson,,No,2019.0,10 - October,Picture Essay,https://www.notion.so/Kids-with-Chains-d9a2070769334d70b1374a360f545fad,Anna Nguyen,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/14J4_RBibrMJK8oSNPg7AvtLxztqxfAbIfDJhGwn-bMQ/edit,No,"Until the rest of his grandfather’s six-pack was gone, Michael listened. Although he was mostly skeptical that this was one of is fantastical stories, like the story he tells about the shaman who could shoot bright, baseball-sized balls of fire from his belly to heal the infirm and the sick, Michael still listened intently because in every one of his grandfather’s stories there was a universal lesson to be learned.
As the years went on, and his grandfather passed away, Michael ultimately graduated from college and immediately began working at a big advertising company in lower Manhattan, New York. And never once did he see or experience any supernatural manifestations of fear, as his grandfather had suggested. Well… until today.
Throughout the workday, Michael noticed a couple of weird things around the office. With Sarah, the ever-smiling receptionist, there was a seven-foot tall dark figure that loomed ominously behind her ergonomic chair. This silent man-like figure had no discernible features. No mouth. No eyes. Dull and dark ashen skin. Sarah didn’t seem to notice at all. Same thing with Vicky, his project manager. Chained to opposite ends of her desk, there were huge, dark gargoyle-like figures that sat soundly on the floor. It appeared that Vicky was oblivious to the creatures -- their featureless faces and the long black horns jutting, like curved sabered blades, from both of their skulls. In one moment, Michael could see these shadowy figures as clear as the people standing next to them, and in the next moment, in the batting of an eyelash, the dark figures wouldn’t be there. Michael just rubbed the stress from his eyes and figured that these extra-long workdays were starting to take a toll on him.
After work, standing on the platform, waiting for the subway train, Michael snacked on a granola bar. All he had for lunch was a bagel. Out of the corner of his eye, about 30 yards away at the far end of the platform, Michael noticed two small dark figures staring at him. They were both child-like with jet-black, tight curly hair. As the subway train approached, he crumpled up the empty granola wrapper and tossed it in the garbage canister. When he looked again, down towards the far end of the platform, the two dark figures were gone. He looked around. Just a few people scattered about. The train slowed to a stop. He got on and took a seat in the half-empty train.
As he scrolled through the unread messages on his phone, Michael couldn’t help but overhear a young couple, sitting two seats behind him, arguing over the girlfriend being too flirty with boyfriend’s older cousin. As Michael took a quick glance behind him, to get a better look at the couple, he noticed the two shadow kids with curly hair standing at the back of the train-car. They were chained together at the wrist, standing there, motionless. Although they had no lips, no mouth, no eyes, he could feel the intensity of their gaze directly upon him. His heart began beating faster. He didn’t know why. Why was he suddenly afraid? They were just small shadowy, harmless apparitions and nothing more, he thought to himself.
Michael immediately got off at the next stop, even though his stop was three more stops away. The two small dark figures followed and chased after him. Michael found himself sprinting up the stairs of the subway and through the uncongested evening streets. He didn’t know where he was. He just ran as fast as he could down the sidewalk. Quickly glancing behind him, he could see the two shadow kids closing in on him. The scrape of metal from their long, conjoined chain skidding across the pavement. Their swift, tiny footsteps rushing closer.
Michael suddenly opened the back door of a random yellow cab and jumped in. Frantically fishing fifty dollars from his pocket, he shoved it through the partition slot to the cabby.
Almost out of breath, Michael said, “Just go. Go… Hurry!”
The cab sped off. Michael looked out the back window. The two chained dark figures were standing there, sullen, yet defiant, in the middle of the street. It looked like they had grown taller.

I told my best friend to closely watch her drink and not take anything that wasn’t poured out of a new bottle. She wanders off.
About twenty minutes later my best friend leads me to the bathroom. She says we can leave the party now. She hands me a Sandisk computer thumb drive on a lanyard. She tells me to put it around my neck and not lose it. She still won’t give me any details about what this whole party is about. I don’t want to leave since we have been here less than an hour and there are too many perfect tens at the party.
I meet Serena who is a perfect ten. We are having a great conversation and plenty of vodka. One of the waitresses tells me my best friend is in the bathroom vomiting. When I see her I think somebody put something in her drink. It is time for us to leave the party.
I am mad at my best friend for allowing something to be slipped in her drink. At the same time she wanted to leave three hours earlier. I put the computer drive in the suite safe.
I put her down on the cold marble floor in our suite. I got some apple juice from the mini bar and pour it on the floor next to her. When she wakes up she’ll think she urinated on the floor. I know she’ll be mad about me not putting her in bed so I sleep on the rug.
We both wake up about the same time. She sees the “urine” and tries to clean it up before I wake up. I tell her it is not lady like to pee on the floor and she turns bright red with embarrassment. I don’t tell her it’s apple juice. She did not ever tell me why she had to pick up that computer drive at the party.

Thank you, Voldemort, for making me think my evil thoughts were okay. Your dark deeds inspired me. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.
Thank you, Inu Yasha, for teaching me to sharpen my nails into claws, preparing to slash people’s faces off when they made me angry. I only did it once, in fifth grade, before I had sharpened them. I’m sure he appreciated your mentorship of me. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.
Thank you, every person who ever got powers in a movie or comic or book when they turned 16, for bolstering my deep expectation that I, too, would find that path. Indeed, my disappointment was more motivating than the hope. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

So thank you all for helping me get locked in a box for a grand total of LWOP years. My fault, yes, I take responsibility for it, but you helped. You really helped.
Suffice it to say that my inspirations didn’t always help me to pursue what was health and/or righteous. You might think, “Well, I’m not schizophrenic, so I can’t be tricked like that.” Perhaps. But many people have been duped by subtler things than overt themes in fiction. Here’s a rule. If you find yourself inspired by something, check to see if what you’re inspired to do is in line with God’s word and if it helps you and your fellow man. If it doesn’t drop it quickly.

I at first believe them to be hallucinations, or possibly decoys hanging from gossamer threads. Rubbing my eyes in exasperation I realize there are hundreds of these nutritious birds flying about an island impossibly drifting atop this unending sea of indifference.
Kicking like a hungered madman, which in both cases I can attest to its truth, I slowly make my way to the shore and find a small waterfall coming from within, its source a mystery but the freshness of its emission a bane to this tired soul.
The birds screech their hatred as they fly above me encircling two enormous trees standing not unlike guards upon this impossible manifestation of an island. How could they row so majestic in a place this barren? What nutrients feeds their roots?
Stone structures completely cover the surface. A maze of concretions covered in some unknown script and stairways leading nowhere. Atop the island sits a small building carved it seems from a single piece of cyclopean stone. A doorway within the stone beckons me like a magnet does metal. Blackness resides beyond this doorway. A blackness so deep, the nothingness hurts my eyes after so many days of staring at the evil sun.
My legs barely support my withered body as my malnourishment is so severe. The water that once supported me now drips helplessly from my tattered clothes. I think I feel a vibration emanating from deep within the island. My stomach lurches, allowing me to taste the bile once again of an unknown terror. I grab ahold of one of the trees as the entire island begins to rise higher above the ocean until I witness what cannot be true. The one god I had forgotten in my pleas of mercy has found me once again.
Modern instructors at the famous Miskatonic University have catalogued all of the Great Old Ones and now I find myself riding upon the back of the great forgotten god, Dagon, himself. His trap set out for me alone gives me a sense of belonging. He did this all for me. I am something special in his many eyes.
I cannot kick myself away from the tentacle this time, for I am upon land, upon Dagon, and with my final breath I see not just one giant tentacle, but hundreds. Each one taking a small piece of me with it."

Liberals and humanist conservatives who have been duped by the humanistic god of science, along with socialists, communists and various godless factions, have dedicated their lives to perverting The Spirit of the Law. The Spirit of the Law determined freedom of religion to mean that we could, and would, worship God without oppression. Perverters of the law twist freedom of religion and liberty to mean something else entirely. They teach their children, and yours, to have non-Biblical behaviors, up to and including sex, to please themselves in any manner they choose without restraint, and to worship any god of their own making. They anger against America’s Spirit against America’s Christian God. With their cultist mentality, they follow leaders who would, like Barack Obama, stand in front of the American news media with near orgasmic delight to say, “We are no longer a Christian nation.” Of course, the American Spirit metaphorically slapped him, his potential successor, Hillary, and every other Presidential candidate who thought to eliminate America’s Christian biblical standards. Nationwide, the American Spirit took positions of power from those dissenting, un-American factions.
This nation of many races of people from many different environmental, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds has recognized the factions who have developed and cultivated contrary attitudes toward the American Spirit. The contrary factions who would spit on our God are like cockroaches in our society. The silent majority has risen up to stomp on them. We are a conservative, individualistic, American Republic. We have common sense. We will retain our liberty, as heaven designed commitment to Providential design. All liberals duped by the humanistic god of science, along with socialists, communists, and various anti-Christian factions will lose their fight against the American Spirit. Their attitude has done nothing but create animosity, division, and hate; but the armies of God have unleashed. We, with the American Spirit, have appealed “to the Supreme Judge of the World” (261)."

Apologies are how people attempt to make others feel ok about them. I apologize for my past, now do you feel better? Of course, an apology is just a string of words though. The best apology is the one a person gives by showing you, through his/her actions, that he/she is not following the same course as before.
Exceptions exist within every algorithm. The probability that you’ve changed may be small but it does exist. However, if you haven’t changed (and are still a weirdo) the probability that your apology will be a lie is very high.
So save your apologies.
Show me, just like I’ll show you, that you are the type of person I want to associate with."

But is she sad too? The heart that never had the chance to grow wants to know. Left alone, cold and buried in the snow, to never have a chance. Stops beating to be alone. So that it won’t become broken.
Crushed hunger, wasted hopes, ruined dreams, and the emotion of ghosts. A past that surfaces unforgotten, why? The wolf can’t help being wounded, it comes whenever he meets one like her. Never to speak. Playwriting the traumatic emotion of the world. Dreaming. The sad wolf.

Now this was going to take a minute. The laces had been pulled extra tight almost to the top. The thought flashed through my mind: it was Barbara.
I wasn’t upset with her. I was upset with myself for not thinking of it first.
The line that led inside the cafeteria wasn’t long. I saw Barbara waving and smiling. I could only grin. After all she won the bet. My name was called out loud. Carla! Carla, come join us. We have plenty of room. I knew this girl well. It was Pamela Porter. The most annoying girl in our school. Once she started to talk you couldn’t get a word in edgewise. “Later”, I told her as I passed by and headed to sit with Barbara.
“Hope you like your juice fresh. Thank you for taking your time and letting me win,” she said with a grin, taking another bite of her toast. I too had a few things I could battle with. But it could wait till later.
Barbara told me she had four older brothers who would try to get to the table first. I had to learn to get them before they did anything to me. That way my food would still be hot. “I know you were wondering about my leg,” she said. “The doctors removed it because it didn’t work properly. Once I am fully grown, they will fit me with one that works. You can see I can get around very well.” Then she did that funny smile.
“All right boys and girls, we have a full day planned for all of you,” said the PA. “Canoe rides, swimming, archery, flute making, and how to catch fish.” Then the PA went dead.
Barbara and I both agreed to learn how to make a flute. Once we both had put the finishing touches on it, our instructor took our flutes and graded them. During the sounds each produced, he carved our names on the side. Then he handed them back to us. Not only was he delighted in the work we had done, we all were given Indian names.
The day we were to leave, I talked with Barbara. We hugged and agreed to exchange our flutes.
Once in a while I still think of Barbara and how twenty years changed my life. I close my eyes and produce a soft note. Remembering back to Camp Catawba and my friend with the artificial leg. With hopes that she would be playing my flute at the same time I’m playing hers.

No bigger than a turtle's shell, Anna teases it. They anchor offshore; swimming Adam and Eve: naked and unashamed.
Anna is first to shore. Parmigiano admiring her wet form. The saltwater reluctant to release its caress.
Eager to create their first child on this unexpected and uncharted isle, she drags her husband into the stone hut sitting atop it's miniature hill. The hut's door long since rotted off. Wood raftered roof splintered and dilapidated, giving peeks at shivering leaves in the two-tree canopy above them. But there is no uncomfortable place for young lovers to arrive. Arrive. And arrive again.
Giano, as she calls him, awakens, amazed at the dimness visible through the ceiling holes. They must've slept dawn to dusk. He tickles his wife awake in unmentionable ways.
The trees above seem to revive with them. Odd, no wind can be heard whistling. Out the front door, boney branches scar the view of sea and vessel, dancing hypnotically. The sun is bright beyond the limbs. The tree limbs must have shifted, causing spooky darkness.
The bride and groom shrug it off.
Surgically sutured to Giano's side, Anna is led docilely into the air. A seagull shrieks. A thousand hands grab a hundred of their body parts, snatching them airborne. Leaves and vines cling and rip at them. Anna's legs (her arms are pinned), and Giano's arms, desperately grip the other lover.
He screams her name, foliage swarms his open mouth, piercing his fleshy cheeks, stabbing up his nostrils, crawling for his brain.
Anna screams for him.as his true love, she could not hold her tongue. She screams and won’t be stopped. Not as vine upon vine slithers snuggly around her neck.
Mercifully, broad leaves scratch out Parmigiano's eyes.
Snap! Her yells go silent.
His ears know: they broke her neck.
The agony of acid slowly dissolves into his blistering skin-quicker than his suffocation. We are being digested, eaten like flies in a web, he thinks.
As his brain dims, he begins to hear the voices in the woods. Souls hundreds of years old, trapped, screaming, tortured, still being feasted on. And now, they are here to join them."

The event occurs in milliseconds, but the playback has been significantly slowed down. Now watch closely.”I took a breath, and pressed play. What I saw was beyond rational explanation. “What am I looking at here Roberts? I see Caine at the window, he turns, and then…,” I pantomimed a twirling tornado with my index finger.
I continued replaying the footage. Roberts continued his rundown, “At first, I thought maybe it was some form of spontaneous combustion. So we did a full tech-sweep for traces of biological remains. A peculiar trail of DNA fragments was discovered. It leads from the cell interior, through the window, out along the grass and basketball court, and on up to the guard tower. Even on a guard’s hat, found just outside the fences. But these fragments were not linked to any bodily substance, like blood of saliva, detective. Though we did match the DNA to control samples found on a few of Caine’s personal items.”
My logical grasp, on this situation, was weakening...I aimed and fired a quick response. “So what does all this mean, Roberts?” We’re here to investigate a NORMAL inmate escape!” Roberts detected my hint of annoyance, and proceeded with caution. “Well, detective Forster, may I be completely honest?”
I handed him back his tablet and gave him my full attention.” The evidence here, implies something that is...inexplicably unique - something beyond any NORMAL investigative perceptions. This is something supernatural.” I didn’t debate, or deny him. I lightened up and yielded, “But that makes this a little out of our jurisdiction, right Roberts? Where are those two agents from the X-files? Where’s Professor Xavier and the X-men? Maybe we need Scooby Doo and the gang?”We shared a brief laugh. It diffused the growing tension.
Roberts then moved in closer, with a glint of excitement in his eyes. “Detective, if we really want to uncover the truth, we could use an alternative perspective. I may know someone that can aid us in the investigation.” I sighed disbelief, but bit the bait in a low reply, “make it happen...quick and quiet.”
Roberts rushed off to contact his unconventional connection. I remained standing, in the cell Matthew Caine had called “home” for over nine and half years, staring out of the window. The surrounding pines were swaying, and mocking me, in a steady wind. Caine was out there somewhere. I felt it in my core. But where? How?

It seemed that she didn’t have much regard for the men in our church. That wasn’t something I could respect. It made me angry that she didn’t treat them right. Hooking up wasn’t a trend back then. I don’t think she slept with anyone, but she played with my money and men’s emotions.
Years go by, and I’m friends with her brother still. We hang out all the time, and we even have a clique of fun loving guys raising hell.

He tried to explain it to these companies forever. God only knows how much stuff he had to mail back. I know who it was, but he had good reason. I’m fiercely loyal, so I’ll leave it at that.

As fate would have it, only his sister liked that Listerene. I told Brandon that I was finally going to pay his sister back for all that bull she pulled. He tried to talk me out of it but to no avail. I had to be careful not to piss in it too much or she’d know something was up. I told Brandon I’d get him if he snitched me out or interfered. Every week, I’d ask about the Listerene. As it turned out, she gargled my piss for weeks!
One week, I ask Brandon about it. He said he saw his dad using it that morning. Apparently, he couldn’t tell. Dean shouldn’t have used it, but it was funny, especially because he checked his son’s eyes like he was the police looking for drug use. He was just so anal that I didn’t feel bad about it.
Sometimes, practical jokes have unintended victims. It can be unfortunate, sometimes anyway. Always be cautious of who you screw over though. It may be years before they get their revenge. It may be the last person you expect. If they’re known as monsters of revenge, it may be in a very unorthodox manner. That doesn’t mean it won’t come. Be mindful of how you treat others. A stoner might have you gardling his piss for over a month with your family, or even worse."

The fundamentals of the United States Constitution and the entire United States “Justice” System have veered so far off-track from what our founding fathers had intended it to be, they wouldn’t even recognize it. We need to get back to the basics the way our founding fathers intended. We need to get America back to the America that soldiers that soldiers shed their blood and risked their lives for. Back when crime rates were lower and children were taught morals and consequences in school without the fear of a lawsuit. Back to when mass incarceration was not an issue and families were not destroyed because of it.
Bargains can come in all shapes and sizes. But for prisoners, they come at such a high price. Does anyone out there care? The bigger question is what are we going to do about it?"

How do you feel? Angry? What if I told you that we were never set free and that we are still slaves all over the world? If I told you that Blacks will never have the rights that a white man has? The Constitution was written when slavery still existed and was written by white men who owned slaves and took part in the cruelty and inhumane treatment of African slaves. From rape to beatings and murders, they showed us that our lives did not matter to them.
OK, you may say that that was the past, that white people have changed, and that the Democrats have made the conditions better for Black people in America. That slavery no longer exists. Learning the Constitution of America is important so that we know what are constitutional and federal rights are. The 13th Amendment gives States the legal right to re-enslave Black people if they are convicted of a crime. So to get the slaves, they need to populate these prison plantation industries owned by white men and Jews. The justice system conspires with the police to round up as many African Americans as they can to work in these prison factories for free. Some of us are innocent, but that does not matter when they forcefully drag us in chains into these state courts and use information they know to be false. They bring charges against us, and here, we are assumed guilty until proven guilty in a court of law. The judge, the prosecutor, and the appointed counsel work together to convict us then give us large amounts of time to make sure we die in prison as slaves.
The prison system treats us in the most inhumane way and are allowed to get away with murder. White offenders are not treated the same way because their color gives them more rights and better treatment. Former President Bill Clinton played a major role in enslaving Black people when he trapped us in prison through the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). While white people do this, Black Americans still run to vote for the Klu Klux Klan party that legalized slavery, and Republican politicians like Rick Perry, George W. Bush, and Greg Abbott don’t give a damn about no niggers living in Texas! They have done all they can to lock all Black Americans up in Texas, the state with the highest rate for illegal and wrongful convictions in this country. That’s something they are proud of.
God Most High says: What is there beyond truth but error? (10:35) He also says: Man is at loss, except those who believe, perform honourable deeds, encourage truth, and encourage patience. (103:3).
I’m not saying that all white people are this way because they are not. Some are our sisters and brothers that feel the same way about the injustice African-Americans face every day of our lives just because they were born Black. Silence is never the answer after you have found out the truth. No more singing ol’ negro spirituals while they beat us with billy sticks then stick dogs on us! No more turning the other cheek to let them punch us again! No more will our blood flood the streets from not defending ourselves! No! We will not allow the government to take our Second Amendment right to bare arms as American citizens. If we do, then we will truly lose what little freedom we have left to defend our homes, families, and properties--as well as our life and liberty--from being seized by the government.
What is worth dying for as a human being? I offer you a suggestion if you are really willing to pay the ultimate cost for your freedom: revolution is the only solution. Why be scared to die when you are already dead? I found the truth, and that is that we have to be willing to die to live..."

Then we have some special events such as the 4th of July fireworks show in the air for its spectacular burst of colors or how about when a spacecraft is launched into outer-space, we watch it go until it is out of eye sight, while we can no longer see it, we are confident it is up there somewhere!
Here is one that not many will stop to think about when they are looking up-ward, and we can find it written in (Thess 4:17) where it tells us how we will too one day ascend up into the air when Christ returns to meet him in the clouds.
Not many actually stop to think of those who have already made this same journey that we all are looking forward to making. We can read about these chosen few in the Bible such as:

Moses (Matt 17:3) appeared with Elijah and Jesus in the transfiguration
Enoch (Gen 5:24 & Heb 11:5) God took him without dying
Elijah (2nd Kings 2:11) God took him alive up in a whirlwind
Jesus (Luke 24:5) appeared to many after being raised to life

As you have read, Enoch and Elijah went up to Heaven to be with God without tasting death, likewise Jesus said in (John 8:52) that “if a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.”
So where does power come from who can preserve life or with his word can call you up into the Heavens above? Of course, it is the almighty God, who is where? In the Heavens above!
Everything you see in the sky should remind you of the one important thing you can’t see, but nonetheless, you know that he is up above and beyond the things you can see! “God”!!
Tell me if this sounds familiar, something may happen to you, that is unpleasant, what do you do? Raise your hands up in the air and say “Why me lord!” The disciples of Isaiah were experiencing this same feeling where in (Isa 8:21) it says, “they will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry, they will be enraged, they will be turning their faces upward” (paraphrased). It is clear to see whom they blamed for their situation and how they directed it to the sky above (or the Heavens).
We all know God is Above during our good times and our tough times, my point is this, we should always give thanks to God in our good times and pray to our God above during our tough times through our prayers.
In (Psalms 5:3) it says, “In the Morning I will direct my prayer unto thee and I will look up!” Our father God is in Heaven above (Matt 5:16), he has been there since creation, the things we see in the air are his works, so look past the visual in the air to see the unseen and infinite God, we may not see God himself, but we can surely see his works and Glory!"

At first, I thought it must be a snapping turtle or something. I just knew at any moment, the line would break.
My son started jumping up and down with joy. His cries became so loud that my wife heard him from the house and came running out to the dock to see what was wrong. She came to a stop when she had seen that nothing serious was wrong.
“Is everything o.k., dear?” she asked, “I heard screaming.”
“Don’t worry,” I replied, “I got a monster on here. Go get the camera ready and fire up the grill. We may have one for the record books.”
It was at that moment that the fish broke the surface of the water as it leapt so high that people in the next county would later tell us that they had seen the fish’s leap. There are no words to describe the size of this mammoth beast. It was easily the size of a Volkswagen. It had fins the size of a hang glider and its mouth could have swallowed me whole. The splash of the water from its leap soaked the three of us.
“Hurry and go get the camera, woman!” I screamed, “We got to document this. Big Bubba here makes ‘Jaws’ look like a sucker fish! Nobody will ever believe us if this sucker gets away.”
“Yes, dear,” my wife replied as she ran up the hill to get the video camera. She wasn’t gone very long at all. By then, I had worked up a sweat, trying to battle this record-breaking fish.
Back and forth, we went and the whole time, my wife videotaped everything. The fish was all fight and no give. It continued to leap out of the water like a bucking bronco at a rodeo. If there was a way, I could have rode the fish that day; I would have.
In the end, the fish finally won our test of wills. My arms became so tired that I couldn’t hold on to the pole any longer. With a light tug, the fish that would have made me famous got away. I immediately started crying.
We replayed the video that night and my wife suggested that I should post it on the Internet, and so I did. If nothing else, at least, I got proof of my claim; right?
Wrong!
As soon as I posted it, people started, saying the video was a hoax. Nobody believed the fish was real. Like what? Did people think that I had one of my drinking pals dress up in a whale suit and jump in and out of the water with my fishing line in his mouth? Come on, people. I ain’t the government here.
Eventually, the experts analyzed the video like they did with those bigfoot videos and in the end, they declared the videos as inconclusive. What does that even mean? When I found it in the dictionary, I got mad! They doubted my video!
Never mind, I had two witnesses, not counting the witness in the next county that had seen it leap out of the water plus the video footage. That’s got to count for something; right?
In the end, it counts for nothing, I guess. So, now I sit here at the dock most days and wonder what could have happened. I also wonder where that fish is today. Probably down there at the bottom of the lake, laughing at me. I gave up fishing after that. I don’t see any point in it anymore. My son and I decided to take up deer hunting. Maybe, we’ll get us a monster buck."

Another frustrating situation involves Institutions violating their own establishing rules and regulations. Standard Operating Procedures (S.O.P) are clearly defined as are punishments for violations of the S.O.P. The S.O.P. is utilized to punish offenders within the institution, though fails to address violations by staff and Administration on a daily basis. This double standard leads to animosity and non-compliance by inmates who regularly witness staff go unpunished for repeatedly violating the rules. One example; several officers for years were committing crimes which finally came to light when the offending officers were arrested and fired after a federal investigation uncovering money laundering and scamming involving millions of dollars being stolen from the public. More officers than inmates were charged and prosecuted. Another example; Officers have been arrested in large numbers for importing contraband into the prisons where they’re employed. Cell phones, marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, tobacco, liquor, weapons and ammunition are a small sampling of the offenses committed by those entrusted with employment to uphold the public confidence by adhering to the law. This hypocritical behaviour is prevalent throughout the nation - I point out Georgia’s deficiencies because that’s who currently houses me.
I realize our nation suffers from similar acts of malfeasance as the ones I witness here. The United States incarcerates its adult population at a higher rate per capita than anywhere in the world! For the nations captors to be as complicit in illegal activities as those they enslave is ludicrous. The erosion of our nation’s harmonious existence (if there ever has been harmony) is evident by the youth entering the prison systems in staggering numbers. My hypothesis is that the youth, missing the influence of one or both parents due to incarceration is the harbinger of this negative trend in the U.S. societies nationwide. The minority communities are hardest hit as the are the most heavily subjected to incarceration, though minorities commit roughly the same amount of offenses per capita as the caucasian majority. Crooked judiciary, biased juries have caused our system of “justice” to reflect a “just us” mentality. “Just us”, minorities being railroaded by the courts, “just us” caucasians escaping punishment. Police killings on video has revealed a disturbing trait of minorities being murdered without the perpetrator being punished. Where does this insanity end? I haven’t a clue, though I suspect a large rift developing which will devour the offending parties. Universal (karmic) laws have a way of balancing the scales as history has shown in the past. Are we too blind to see that we cannot, should not, continue along the same paths of injustice and intolerance which led to deadly revolutions in the past? I pray we become more honorable, All of us!

“Yeah,” I reply. “I gotta hit a few warm ups first.”
The weight room by now is full of the noises of men grunting, weights clapping and between sets the conversations of fitness and newly learned routines.
Jon is about 5’6, 180 pounds, forty-five years old and in good shape. He works out for fitness and health. Myself on the other hand, and I’m twenty-five years old, 5’7, 168 pounds solid. I workout for strength and looks and I admire bodybuilders such as Frank Zane, Dorian Yates, and Phil Heath.
I do my first warm up set of eight reps and 195 pounds with Jon spotting me the whole time.
“Gotta getta pump,” is being shouted all over; it’s our weight room motto.
“Gotta getta pump!” I say loudly after my light warm up set.
Jon starts his warm up with a hefty 235 pounds. He tends to start heavy and work lighter as he goes, the opposite of myself.
I rest a moment before returning to the bench. I put on 250 pounds for my second warm up. I lie under the weight, which starts in the bottom position, bar touching my chest, arms bent, not extended and away from the chest like most bench presses.
I push the weight up and do six reps. I feel strong today! I think I can hit the 310 pounds! I rise off the bench.
“Good set,” says Wonk, just coming back from the water fountain down the hall.
I know before attempting to lift so much weight, I have to wait at least three or four minutes to let my muscles rest or else my pecs and triceps will be too exhausted and I will have no chance at lifting that amount of iron.
In the meantime, Jon does two sets: the first at 235 pounds and the second at 220. After my long rest period, I am ready to attempt to lift the whole weight stack. I put the pin all the way down to the bottom, at the 310 mark. I lie on my back on the bench and get into position. I am going to lift in a way similar to the way a power lifter does, with my elbows in, heels pressing into the ground, back arched, a thumb-less grip, and being sure not to lift my butt from the bench. This form is different from the way a bodybuilder might lift with elbows out and back completely flat. I will bench like a powerlifter to increase the load I can lift by using my whole body, not just my chest and arms.
I have Jon and Leonard help me get into an up position. I’ll start with my arms extended. They help me into positions and now I’m on my own. I feel the pressure of the weight as I let it down slowly but not too slow. As the bar touches my chest I grunt loudly, all the rage, anger, anxiety and sorrow I have is being released on this bar. I feel the tightness in my chest, arms turning to Jell-O, the flesh-frying pain of 310 pounds, the weight of the world.
I’m pushing up hard now; it’s slowly moving, my heels grinding into the floor. I hear the squeaking of the machine and feel the blood rushing through my limbs. I’m halfway up now; the weight stops moving. It is too much strain! The bar falls on my chest. I sigh. Luckily it wasn’t free weights or I would have been crushed. I had it! I know that I had it...almost."

Running through the trees at the edge of a cow pasture often proved to be a mistake.
There were other animals around, whose calling cards were smaller but still hard to get out from between the toes: dogs, cats, deer, squirrel, coons…. I spent a lot of time cleaning my feet.
As a young man wrestling cattle, I always wore expensive cowboy boots. They would get really messy, but I always had them cleaned up and shining before time for church on Sunday.
Sometimes we package cow shit, buy and sell it, and mix into the soil in our gardens. Then we call it manure. That’s a good word. But if any of my children tracked it through the dining room, I would not say “Oh, manure!”
Pamela said she loved me and made all kinds of promises. That was a crock of shit. She collected my sperm and my money; now, I’m a political prisoner in a Carolina plantation.
Shit is good for many things, not just fertilizer. I’m not sure how they do it now, but for a thousand years, gunpowder was made from old bot droppings. In The Help, a maid baked a “chocolate” pie with her secret ingredient and fed it to an aggressive employer. I have been unable to obtain her recipe, but I am the same person who used to walk across pine cones, jagged shale, and swan and goose droppings but refused to wear shoes.
Life has handed me a pile of shit. I do not choose to step in it and spend the rest of my days scrubbing between my toes and feeling sorry for myself. Not as long as I can drop my drawers and make a few piles of my own."

There, an oppressive atmosphere had filled its walls to the brim with a hodgepodge of intimidation, belittlement and unremitting anger that assaulted the senses the moment one crossed the threshold into its hallowed halls, even if HE wasn’t inside. The mere turning of thoughts to those tragedies endured released the floodgates, drowning him in a torrent of angst that in the past could torment his soul into fitful states of sweat-soaked, catatonic panic attacks, debilitating him into capitulation. No more.
In the House of Horror, his totalitarian tormentor religiously reigned in pernicious power over his licentious life and its oppressive objectives exercising an advantage over him he had not been bequeathed-- oh, how that would now change. Here is where numerous scars had built up, one atop another with each repetitious reinforcement of how to stand, how to talk, how to eat, how to sit, how to write, how to read, how to dress, and how he was expected to think. No more.
Here is where the meticulous molding of his life had been chartered by hands not of his own. The repeated raps of wooden rulers over knuckles as he messed up an oral exam were only outdone by the loud wacks of hard leather across his soon-to-be-welted flesh of his back bared to the room in order to impress the need to be better so this path of punishment and future humiliation could be avoided. This house would be the battlegrounds for both the war waged over his soul and the final fight for the right to become who he really wanted to be. No more.
No more.
No more would there be any opportunity for THEM to demean and denounce his attempts of creativity. No more would THEY, or anyone else, curb his desire to decorate his existence how he saw fit. No more would a tyrant tower over his potential, constraining him within a box of conformity dictated by restrictive, subjective, social standards from a time long since passed, pass to the new horizons before him.
As he looked up, a firefly floated down into the ripples of the waves lapping gently over his extended legs. The life of the thing extinguished by a saturation unable to sustain the alien life form intruding into its domain. The droplet that fell upon the floating, blacked the carcass surprised him. He has not realized how releasing today truly was. As his tear melted into the crystal waters beneath, sobs wracked his body with therapeutic convulsions, forcing more tears to fuse with the blue-green liquid now littered with countless fireflies bespeckling a surface new black from their kamikaze dives.
He turned to watch their nest, marveling at the sheer numbers that had spawned at such a rapid pace. The wind-carried, red-tiled flakes rained over him, mingling with his hair and alighting even upon his long eyelashes. His hand rose to wipe his vision, clear, but they too were covered in soot.
The once expansive Mansion of Misery that was the place of his imprisonment and sought to oppress him into obscurity now instead cowered amidst flames licking the very life from her timbers. As the embers carried upward from the spewing smoke and dispersed into swarms to spread word of this pivotal moment in history, laughter replaced the sobs, for a realization had dawned: he was a phoenix reborn from these soon-to-be smoldering ashes, no longer restrained from his artistic, altruistic design to bring fireflies to those he had been prevented to before. Now he would show them all of his real potential..."

Although the mother is interacting with the newborn with maternal playfulness and optimism; there is still an atmosphere of weariness and uncertainty.
In the background, the television is too loud, perhaps to drown out reality. It competes with the mother’s words. It is turned into a documentary about geoengineering and technological evolution, with the attendant human and geological suffering of climate change.
A picture hangs on the wall of the famous poem, “footprints.” A treasured memento received from her mother, who used to read it to her as a little girl. The picture has captivated the newborn’s attention. The mother sees an opportunity to introduce the poem, taking her baby’s feet into her hands, but the overly loud documentary casts a gloomy overshadow on the otherwise tender moment.
MOTHER
One day, a man had a dream that he was walking along a beach. As he continued to walk, he noticed behind him footprints in the sand.
NEWBORN
(smirks playfully)
TELEVISION
On some fundamental level, we all know something is wrong with our planet. Geoengineering has upset the natural order of things, and the equilibrium of the earth’s natural processes has been compromised. Brashly intruding upon nature’s domain awakens an aspect of human nature that is disturbing and corrosive. Internally, it reaches deep into the dark recesses of the heart - the corrupt core, which finds purpose in the expedient drive to exalt itself over all things. At the same time, that drive is also derived, externally, from outside the civilized guidelines; it is a primal thrust of archaic domineering...
NEWBORN
(kicks feet playfully in Mother’s hands)
MOTHER
(smiling fondly at Newborn)
… the footprints were telling the story of the man’s life. There were times on his life journey with one set of footprints and other times with two sets of footprints. The man wondered about this…
TELEVISION
… this threat must be met by a moral position foreign to all laws, policies and governing bodies. In other words, if the intent of the entities responsible for geoengineering and technological transhumanism is born from primal instincts, then, humanity is entitled, by virtue of self-preservation to meet the onslaught accordingly, with means that reflect and promote survival, completely removed from social protocols, norms, governing contracts and the like. The free individual must meet the toxic rule, by force of will, with an overwhelming brute force, to achieve inherent self-determination.
MOTHER
(tickling newborn’s feet)
… the man continued to walk along the beach, contemplating his life’s journey and the footprints in the sand. At the end of his life, he encountered Yahshua...
NEWBORN
(cooing; at Yahshua’s name, the newborn becomes intent on Mother)
TELEVISION
… It is inevitable, however, that there will be proponents of geoengineering, its mechanisms, and its underlying transhumanistic philosophy. Techno-evolutionists, who are currently enthralled by the technocratic think tank-oblivious to its real purpose - may, one day, find themselves enslaved to their own technology. Then, destined to rely on scientific development, they become dependent on inventive captors: resigned to an existence of servitude. Professor Michael Hanby, quoting Francis Bacon, states: “There is a final, more ominous sense of technology inaugurated by this philosophical revolution: technology as a kind of fate. If nature is essentially a machine or, in contemporary nomenclature, a system, then the knowledge of nature is essentially geoengineering. The task of science, as Bacon puts it, is ‘generate or superinduce on a given body a new nature or natures.’”
MOTHER
(looking at “Footprints” with resolute hope)
… “You promised me, Lord, that if I followed you, you would walk with me always. But I noticed that during the most trying periods of my life, there was only one set of footprints in the sand. Why, when I needed you the most, have you not been there for me?
TELEVISION
… Hanby is suggesting this technological relationship results in an interminable revolution against the current order, establishing revolution - paradoxically - as a permanent principle and stable institution. The technological order would constitute perpetual flux. Perhaps, then, in light of the perpetual technological revolution, the “necessary evil” debate must occur. That is, the conversation over geoengineering being necessary for survival, in order to remediate the damage already done for the climate. Who dares to stand in defiance against the tide of change?
YAHSHUA
(demonstrating unconditional love and eternal security)
… “The years when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, is when I carried you.”...
… “and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”

The work was challenging; however, and the critical thinking element began to kick in, especially as it was framed in theological thought. The curriculum opened fresh views and demanded reasoned assessment of one’s values and beliefs, as well as one’s role in community. These two aspects of the experience proved valuable as the two-year program neared its end, as I experienced dread at the thought of losing this activity that had so enriched my life.
One particular reading, Man’s Search for Meaning, by Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist interred in the Nazi death camps, hit home. He had observed a difference between the one-in-twenty-six who survived and the ones who perished. Those who gave up expressed the belief that life had nothing left to offer. Survivors “had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.” (2) Rather than fret over my lost stimuli, it was time to lead others in the community to new ones.
SLU has expanded their presence at ERDCC to include an associate of arts degree program, a monthly speaker series, periodic workshops, and a college prep program. I have been blessed to serve as a teaching assistant in the degree program for five of the last seven years. A student-alumni organization that grew out of a small-group communication class in the degree program serves several roles: cheerleader for all things educational, advisory board to the program’s administrative team, and community service organization. The core service is tutoring prisoners who wish to earn a high school equivalency certificate but are excluded from the regular school program because of the length of their sentences. This not only gives men a chance to fulfill that dream, but gives them hope of entry into the college prep and degree programs. The work makes for full and rewarding weeks. Somehow, you can’t give more than you get.
Flying is great, but how and where you land is just as important.

The only rights we have in such courts are those the politician on the bench thinks will be popular. So, good luck to the black guy in the rural county accused of blank or the slow, poor white kid who was easily manipulated into (falsely) confessing his involvement in a rape and murder with his uncle. Written out, it seems ridiculous that either would get justice because it is ridiculous.
The only reason that Brendan Dassey got justice from a federal district court after three levels of state courts upheld his frame is because Making a Murderer persistently exposed the injustice of his conviction. The wizards of Oz couldn’t close the curtain on his case. He got lucky.
In my own murder case, it seemed that a new trial dropped in my lap when the judge refused to remove from the jury pool a woman who said she was “close friends” with the victim for over twenty years. Because the judge did not strike her I was effectively denied one of the seven strikes guaranteed to both me and the D.A., making the jury selection process unfair. This was a “structural error” that Wisconsin’s supreme court had recently ruled required a new trial.
Six times within three years after my conviction Wisconsin’s supreme court affirmed its decision that the error automatically required a new trial. Given that the judge in my case previously acknowledged how hard it would be for me to find impartial jurors, and then adamantly refused to remove one so obviously incapable of being impartial, for sure I would get a new trial...you would think.
The doctrine of stare decisis mandates courts abide by their prior decisions and I have seven decisions in three years on my side. However, I also had recently elected Wisconsin supreme court justices that were not on my side but rather, on the side of prosecutors who had been crying about having to give defendants fair trials.
Hence in State v. Lindell 629 N.W.2d 223 (Wis. 2001), the slimmest-possible majority crafted a forty-plus page explanation for overruling its seven prior decisions. (Shortly after this decision the attorney who argued my appeal, Timothy Gaskell, was elected D.A. of the county neighboring the one I was convicted in.)
Sure, I was guilty. But I was also framed.
I continued chasing the crumbs of justice. From the moment I entered prison I began studying law, both criminal and civil. When my frame was affirmed, I began practicing it by challenging and beating the “obviously unfair” discipline that caused me to be sent to Wisconsin’s supermax. Then I challenged, beat and got A.A.G Richard Victor sanctioned for frivolously defending the discipline supermax staff concocted to try to justify keeping me here.
But I couldn’t swim above the deluge of discipline they then buried me in (for petty, non-violent misconduct like calling a guard a “pig”) and used to justify keeping me here.
I almost beat my murder conviction.
I almost beat my transfer to this supermax."

I had recently spent the night with a cousin and his best friend. His father: a large haul trucker and unpretentious as the day is long. I began to realize that what had only moments ago felt like a safe haven now felt like a place where I was unwelcome, unloved, and hated. I was nearly paralyzed in my boots by the event. As it began to constrict my chest I looked slowly around to see if anyone outside was awake, anyone who may have witnessed my standing there. But I was alone. I tried to swallow but I knew I was too rattled. I needed to cry so I began walking the block back to my house.
I went to our shed to cry until my mom left for her half day of work at her business, so she wouldn’t have to see me like this. This was the first time I had seen this deep hatred and rage that my father had been disguising...well, for my entire life, I guess.
Though I cried for at least an hour, travelling through emotions of anger, hate, self-pity, embarrassment and shame, the release of tears did little to erase the vividness of his face searing into my memory. Whoever said that “a picture paints one thousand words” should re-examine the image more aposteriorially. As I now know, after a lifetime of unleashing my father’s ire photo ops, that particular “f” word was just a first glimpse into his portfolio of seethe, not the cause-just a reason, an excuse.
My father and I tried to emulate normalcy, paint a picture of tradition. A father-son relationship, in my experience, can be the antithesis of serenity upon closer inspection.
I had originally “looked” at this picture of a fox pushing a goose in a baby tram. A natural predator/prey coupling to come off as “tamed”, a fox in seemingly adoration and service to what otherwise would be a feast. Hence, at first sight, I assumed they had been trained, bonded even and felt hopeful, giddy, sort of. But it’s deceiving. The picture belies an unnatural pairing to initiate a trust between these animals. However, upon closer consideration, I believe that the fox is tethered from his collar by a small “2-3” length of chain to the handle bar, forcing him to stay or hang. The goose is wingpineed or clipped as her feet look bound. The photographer is the deceiver."

Although, my mother feared dying alone, in the end, she didn’t. I was there. The last thing I heard from her was innocent child-like laughter. The night before I moved out, my mother appeared to me in a dream. She was glittery, translucent gold in form, tickling me just like when I was a boy.
Believe it or not, I often dream of things before they happen. I dreamt of both my grandmother’s deaths too.
My father died the day I got out of prison, which sounds like a country song by David Allen Cole, but it’s true. He held on long enough to hear my voice I told him I loved him and was coming home. He passed on during my journey to the house. When I got there, I read chapter seventeen of the Gospel of John, Yahshua’s prayers for his taut ones; then, I carried out my father’s body.
Afterwards, his restless spirit roamed the property. He would knock hats off the hat rack, scatter loose change off the nightstand and trap our animal in strange places. My step-mother consulted a medium. The medium said my father was discontented because he had died so young, at age 55. All of the photographs of his final days were filled with a blurry of activities - living life to the fullest like shooting his .44 magnum and baking cookies in an apron.
Astonishingly, a catholic priest gave my father his last rites with holy water brought all the way from Lourdes, France, the location of many reported miracles over the centuries. My step-mother swears the holy water was applied liberally to my father. When my bottle was given to me, it was filled to the brim; another drop could not be added.
Believe it or not, supernatural events have always occurred in my life.
In elementary school, during television special by acclaimed Israeli psychic, Uri Geller, I was able to restart an old broken watch with extra-sensory perception. It continued to tick for many days.
I’ve seen an interdimensional being.
I’ve been involved in more than one exorcism
Spiritual warfare is a continuous reality
I’ve seen demons on multiple occasions
I’ve seen angels (twice) and they are humongous
I’ve lived in an apartment that was haunted by a nurse named Nan; that fact was confirmed by a medium. Nan liked me but bothered my girlfriend and gave her nightmares. Eventually, she broke up with me, if you can believe that.
I’ve lived in other haunted places too.
For years I believed in extraterrestrials, but now I am not so sure...even though I do have a tattoo of one.
Believe it or not, I once found a tree that looks like the crucified Christ. It still amazes me.
Some things are inexplicable.
Believe it or not, drugs destroyed my life in the past and the lives of those around me.
Back in the day, I smuggled drugs across the Mexican border at Matamoros over fifty times and was never caught. Ultimately, however, it did catch up to me. During poignant moments of honestly, regret from all of the damage I caused surfaces. The negative consequences still revenerate.
It is possible that I found my soulmate long ago. We remain friends, even though we don’t talk anymore; life has moved on: drugs were our downfall.
Believe it or not, I used drugs for over twenty-five years, but now have almost five years clean. This is a miracle. Sometimes I still have mild cravings for a cigarette.
My first felony conviction was for psilocybin mushrooms, a fungus that grows naturally all across the world, and could be argued, was key to man’s evolutionary development- if you believe in such things. After being convicted by a judge who is now an active U.S. Congressman, I was sentenced to six years in prison.
There, working as an outside trustee around hundreds of head of cattle on thousands of acres of ranchlands, I tripped on more psilocybin than in the world. On one tip, I experienced the destruction of the planet which, admittedly, sounds a bit kooky, until you consider that was fifteen years ago, and our current state of climate catastrophe has proven that premonition accurate.
Believe it or not, the weather is being controlled; partly to remediate climate change; partly because the atmosphere has been weaponized; partly because there is profit in food futures and disaster capitalism.
Weather warfare
Believe it or not, the truth is scary
I’ve been close to death. I tell from forty foot and lived. It shattered my pelvis. My right leg is now one inch shorter than the other. Miraculously, after surgery, I stood on my own in one week. Week two: I walked to the bathroom and back.

Today, despite the physical setbacks, I can still play the game I love basketball. And not just play but be a factor, Freakin brothers every way like MJ, with my moves from 1986.
And as remarkable as it may sound, I have been using the same #2 pencil for a year now, which has been instrumental in the majority of my Prisoner Express writings so far. This pencil, Dixon HB 1404, is an absolute savage. Turn up graphite grinder. What, what!

The plane I had sat in was at Springs Park. A place that we all as children began to love. The war plane was just sitting there with nothing better to do except rust away. Of course it gave me the feeling of flying without leaving the ground. Most of all once my feet touched the pedal and pulled back on the stick. I was no longer grounded.
Over the years I have had the chance to fly commercial and other types of aircraft. Most of which carried me to jobs I held while working for a large company. There would be times when the noise of the aircraft was pointed upward. I am not talking about straight up. It sure felt that way. The whole flight I don’t believe it ever leveled off.
I was thinking after all these years I would be over the thought about flying. Well let’s just say, I hope when I do pass on I will have wings of my own. Until then I will keep my eyes and ears to the sky. Hoping that one day I will be able to fly again. This is how I feel about flying. The one song that the group Berlin sang in the mid eighties. “Take my breath away.” That will say it all. Happy flying."

Maybe the kid grew up to get involved with drugs. Maybe they didn’t become a doctor or lawyer. Maybe they just borrowed a car and wrecked it and couldn’t afford to repair it.
Have you ever been with someone you loved and just stopped talking to them because of something that happened between the two of you? Maybe you disagreed on how you were raising your children. Maybe you argued and said something you didn’t really mean. Maybe you cheated on each other even though you really loved one another and regret it, but you just can’t bring yourself to say you’re sorry.
Why? You did play a part in it didn’t you? Even if it was all their fault, are they really worth so little that you can’t just swallow your pride and say those two words?
“I’m sorry.” If you are reading this out loud, then you already just said it. Why not say it to the one who needs to hear it? Do you really feel like you're accomplishing something by saying nothing?
As the days pass, you don’t get more life, you get less. Every second you hold those two words in is a second lost. You can’t get that back. It’s one second closer to the end. For both of you.
Imagine waking up tomorrow. You go to work and your boss tells you that you have a call on line two. You pick up the phone. When you think back on this later, you’ll remember every second of this. Almost as if you lived it in slow motion.
“Hey buddy,” the person on the other end of the line says. “I hate to be the one to break this to you, but he or she passed on today.”
Congratulations. You won. You never had to apologize and now you never will. How do you feel? Was it worth it?
Now you’ll never have to say you’re sorry, and you’ll never know what could have been. Life will go on, but most likely you’ll always have that empty spot in the place where love could have been instead, because you’ll always wish you’d have just done it. Said two words. “I’m sorry.”
The question now really is who do you want to be? The person picking up that phone at work, or receiving that letter in the mail saying they’re gone, or the person who says two simple words that can maybe rekindle a relationship? Is there someone in need of one of your apologies today? Maybe they’ve been wanting to say it too. You can be the bigger man or woman. Just say it before it’s too late. Even if they reject it, you’ll know you did everything you could and that’s more than your doing now. “I’m sorry.”"

I just looked at her and said, “My Grandma.”
All she did was smile, then replied, “Baby, color does not matter; never get caught up in it. Treat people how you want them to treat you and judge them based only on how they act. Always love who your heart says to love, and you will be okay.”
A few years later, my mom moved us from Chicago to Minnesota, and it was there I was first called the n word and my girlfriend, a “n-” lover. It did not take me long to understand that not everyone thought or felt the same way I did: that people were the same no matter the color of their skin. As I became older, I began to truly understand the different ways that society sees black and white.
My grandma is very old now, and I haven’t seen her in a long while. But what she helped me come to realize on that day way back when I was a kid, when I discovered that I was black and she was white, is that skin color truly doesn’t matter. I am confident in myself and happy with who I am. It was on that day I realized that to hate or dislike a person based on race is a waste of time and a disgrace to myself."

The only flat ground around here is the football field where the Mt. High Marmosats lose almost every game. The only similarity to my old school is Pizza Friday, but it is served by a chef whose name is Sal Minelli. His name sounds like Salmonella, and no one thinks that’s odd. They think it’s odd that I’ve never been on skis.
My new friends are not as funny as they think they are, but if I smoke enough pot, I can laugh at their nicknames for the teachers. Mr. Althaus is “Outhouse,” Mr. Farquar is “Fucker,” Mrs. Kruger is “Cougar” (she is one), and so on. When they told me about Coach Dikinball, I asked what his real name is. Turns out Dikinball is an actual surname. Oh, and then there’s Principal Strickler who is, of course, a stickler.
There is an exchange student with dark hair and dark eyes. They say her name is Ulik Mahbodi; that can’t be right. Pitstink can’t remember where she is from, but he’s pretty sure it’s “one of those countries that hate us.”
I would like to just walk up to her, introduce myself, and then ask what her name is. I don’t know if she speaks English or if I will be able to if and when I talk to her. I worry that she will think I like her...because I think I like her. I worry that our relationship will be torn asunder when our countries go to war and that our children won’t be accepted in either nation. Does smoking marijuana make you paranoid?
I don’t know how much fresh air my Dad is getting. We’re staying in a motel that rents rooms by the week until he finds work. Our room is only a few yards away from the road where trucks belch smoke as they struggle to pull the hill. I’m afraid he won’t find work. I’m afraid Mom will catch ebola. I’m afraid the roaches in our room will crawl in my mouth while I sleep. I think I got reasons to be paranoid.
I had a dream last night where I was watching the TV news, and they were saying that ebola has been eliminated in humans, but now roaches got it. Then they said that the country that the exchange student is from was bombing the USA, but they were only dropping giant peaches on us. Then they said that the police were arresting everybody who has pot in their backpack. Then I woke up and saw my dad sitting on the edge of his bed, in the dark, with his head in his hands, sobbing. Yeah, I’m really paranoid now."

Human communities, too, have evolved. Sure, there are still single-celled organisms; there are also still less evolved (not necessarily worse or better) human societies such as hunting/gathering tribes. But there is also the uber complex multicellular organism known as homo sapiens sapiens, and New York City.
Just as cells that joined together necessarily sacrificed much of their individuality in order to join with other cells and make a cohesive, coordinated, most effective organism, so must people sacrifice their individual whims and characteristics in order to make a strong community. This is true even in supposedly divided communities, such as racially and economically segregated cities- all activities lead to Rome, make Rome Chicago, Dallas, L.A., wherever.
People joined together into a community must sacrifice some of their individuality in order for a community to function, to protect itself from external forces, to exist. Unfortunately, I can’t walk around naked in public, nor can I kill people as that would disturb some people and disrupt social cohesion. Some of those sacrifices I can’t bitch too loud about (you ladies, however, may wish to bitch), yet some unique characteristics of individuals that a community consciously or subconsciously peer presses away strike me as losses worth lamenting (e.g. a Richard Pryor in apartheid South Africa, an Einstein in Amish country, me in prison…).
This macroevolution is, however, unstoppable. Large, cohesive communities like New York City rule the world, pressuring smaller communities to join up or join each other into another macro-organism. The world has only so many resources, as did the primordial soup the first single celled life evolved in; organisms will struggle for those resources, and the most cohesive organism will be the most effective struggler, the fittest, the survivor.
Technology, as you can see by observing people passing you by on the street, facilitates the unification/de-individualization that is essential to the super cohesiveness needed for the microorganism of communities to surpass human individuals as Earth’s dominant life form. People are constantly connected to each other, electronically….
For now, I remain a single celled eukaryote."

Jah Rastafari!!!!!!!!!!!
Above is the chanting (reading), based upon my faith as a Rastafarian. The ideology of my faith protects me from my enemies. That is the devil, whom I characterize as an evil spirit that uses its host (individuals), to attempt to take away the peace of true Rastafarians that are binded in their faith to be free from bondage.
When one thinks of the word “protected,” one thinks of a firearm, presumably. But inside a place like this, you have to protect your mind and your health to survive in these end of days.
I remembered like it was yesterday, a nightmare that has haunted me for almost a decade now. In July, 2008, I placed myself in harm's way to protect someone that was battling fourth-stage cancer. Within seconds to think, reluctantly I had to take a person’s life. Do I have remorse? Every single day, especially at pre-trial, upon hearing the victim’s baby-mom stating, “We just had a baby girl.” I felt a lump in my stomach, remembering not having grown up with my biological father which I must add was difficult growing up in a third world country.
The most heart-wrenching moment was watching the person that I was protecting take the witness stand and blatantly lie to protect his own self. I, being so hurt inside, decided to call upon my Empress. Upon hearing another male answering my Empress’s phone, I had to protect my heart, mind, body and soul.
Then here it comes, my first fight in jail; now I have to protect my honor as a man. Yep, won that round, but the second one changed my life drastically: it was with an officer. Unbeknownst, to me, the individual that I had to fight was the officer’s friend.
Here I am, fighting murder in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in second degree, and two assault charges. The only thing that I had to protect my sanity was my faith.
As years went by, I finally had the assault and criminal possession of a weapon charges dismissed. Then I was acquitted of murder (which goes with a mandatory 25 to life) and faced manslaughter in the first degree; I received twenty-two years.
As Aaliyah once said, “Age ain’t nothing but a number,” and that’s the same perspective that I have in regards to being sentenced: “it can/will be given back.” Meanwhilst, I have to protect the inner being of myself, so I don’t get into the politics inside these prison walls.
I’ve seen a lot, of which I don’t wish to go into details but one thing that I can speak on: if one does not protect their deep inner-thoughts and desire to be free then, reluctantly I will say, this cage will be their home.
I’ve witnessed individuals get one and a half to three years convictions who are now facing fifty years to life. That’s real talk. Then I’ve heard inmates shout their last breath, after taking their own life. Then I hear prisoners being beaten to death.
Again, if I was not protected by my faith, then my mind would have given up a long time ago. But when one is looking forward to something/someone in life then one masters the “art of survival,” behind these prison walls. Before I close out on this bio-topic, I just want the readers to know that crime does not pay, but an honest job will.
Also, protect your loved one’s heart, because whoever the individual is, they are doing time with you. Their heart is locked up also. So, in conclusion, provide and protect your offspring so they can/will never see the inside of these walls.

It is a way to liberate this being from the delusion of the sensory condition through wise reflection on the way things are. We begin to observe ourselves, desire for something, or the aversion, the dillness or the stupidity of the mind. We are not picking and choosing or trying to create pleasant conditions in order to understand them as just that, and be able to let them go. We are starting to free ourselves from running away from things we don’t like. We also begin to be much more careful about how we do live. Once you see what it is all about, you really want to be very careful about what you do and say. You can have no intention to live life at the expense of any other creature. One does not feel that one’s life is so much more important than anyone else’s.

Grace had been saving up money from her after school job and bought a car and a new wardrobe; with a little bit of sex appeal. All of a sudden she was going out to football games and parties. All of a sudden she was eating less and exercising. Her motto was “more lettuce, less cake.” All of a sudden a handsome young man, in a nice car, was coming over and taking her out on dates. Nobody was happier than my mom to meet Grace’s boyfriend. Soon, Grace came home bragging to our older brother that she finally did “it.” And by “it” she meant losing her virginity.
Everything was going great until an armed robber walked into Grace’s job, put a gun to her face and said, “Empty out the register!” She did as she was told. When the robber left, Grace broke down like a Pinto on 3 hubcaps. When we got the phone call, we all hopped in the car to pick her up.
Grace was shaken up from her experience and needed to get away. Her gay BFF suggested a vacation. So, with my mom’s blessing and her manager’s permission she went to Mexico for some well-deserved R&R.
Sooner than expected, Grace returned (while no one was home to welcome her), and locked herself in her room. She didn’t want anyone to see her. When her boyfriend came by to check on her, she told him to GO AWAY. Something had happened to her in Mexico, we just didn’t know what.
After days of reasoning with her she agreed to talk to us one by one. Mom went in first before coming out crying, then my brother spoke to her. When it was my turn, I was warned to brace myself for what I was about to see. Grace’s beautiful face looked disfigured with huge purple and red rashes/bumps all over. Not to sound funny, but she looked like something out of a horror movie. She said her face hurt and you could hear the pain in her face when she spoke. Besides the physical pain, the depression was killing her even worse. In her diaries she wrote about suicide.
Mom contacted a witch to tell us what happened to Grace and she had a vision of a girl that Grace had been bullying at school. This Girl was so afraid of Grace that she refused to fight, but retaliated with a curse instead. Grace fessed up and said it was all true.
The witch then set out to reverse the curse while Grace saw a doctor. Luckily, after a few voodoo rituals, pills and ointments, Grace was back to normal and feeling better than ever’ with a few minor scars.
One day Grace and I went to confront her nemesis, but the girl locked herself in the house and threatened to call the cops. I wanted to leave but Grace wanted to kick some ass, “What’s up now, bitch!”
Nowadays Grace owns her own business and has been married for 20 years to a hardworking man. She doesn’t have any kids because she is afraid they will turn out like me. Whatever, I ain’t losing my sleep over it. Sadly, throughout my years in prison we’ve lost touch. Nowadays she acts like we were never related."

The silence that ensued in that dark living room 20 years ago still resonates.
In the moments of everyday prison life, there always comes a tendency amongst inmates to complain. Sometimes for legitimate reasons, sometimes frivolous. Hell, I’ve been guily of it. “Come on, C.O., that ain’t a full scoop!” I unsuccessfully tried to pout out recently in the chow line.
But oftentimes, I make a point to remind myself: This is a cup I poured up -- a bitter, burning, timeless spirit of crime and punishment, cause and affect, choices and consequences. I won’t sit and complain. I sip and continue. Not the most ideal drink, but healthier than the lethal injection taken in by the above mentioned psychopath."

“He left me,” she said through the telephone receiver.
“I won’t,” strength vibrated from him. Solid, certain, fearless. Fierce. She touched the 2-inch shatter-proof glass separating them. Only cold greeted her when he responded.
“Time’s up, bud,” announced the prison guard.
“We’ll make it through this,” he said through the telephone.
“I love you,” tears threaten.
“I don’t deserve it.”
Once home in her apartment, she read his latest letters. Smelling lavender orchids, her tears blossomed.
“Nobody wants to see anyone get hurt,” he pleaded. “Not today…”
“Speak for yourself.”
“Ah, f---!” he thought, “It’s gonna be another long day. S---!”
“Alright, have it your way.” Throwing his hands up, he gave the order. “Sometimes you just can’t reason with these animals,” he thought.
“On three,” commanded the entry squad’s team lead. On three six helmeted, camo-suited, rowdy, gung-ho correctional officers rushed through the prisoner’s barricade. Entering the darkened cell, his domain.
“Offender, you are being charged with a rule one dash one, on attempted one dash one, four, one dash fives, and another one dash eight violation. How do you plead?”
Silence. A small grin.
“Answer me!” Roared the Warden. “Do you think the murder of my officers is funny? You think this is a f---ing joke?!”
“Well,” he began, “I was considering a very serious matter ju-”
Suddenly, the Warden was breath-stinking close. Cords straining in his neck.
“What in the hell is more important in that pea-brain of yours than my dead and wounded officers?!”
Blink. Blink again. A smile tugged his lips. Pleasantly he replied “I was wondering if I’d get the bean-patty or tofu loaf for lunch…”
“You can’t speak to the WARDEN like that,” an officer said. It’d taken four guards to restrain their boss. Uncuffed now in his new coffin. The prisoner turned around, shackles jingling.
“Well, he shouldn’t ask stupid questions.” Unbelievable. Who would’ve thought a prisoner, a criminal, would have such nerve? Didn’t he know he was less than human? A number on a file? An item on a list of things? An object?
“You’re nuts, guy,” another guard half-chuckled. A curtain rose from the prisoner’s face. Frost covered rage blended his eyes. Pupils and irises becoming one devouring abyss. A jaguar would’ve seemed more humane. Insane he wasn’t, far from it in fact. He was too intelligent and methodical, too dissembling to be crazy. Dangerous, though… he was that indeed.
An officer watched him sit at his concrete desk, tofu loaf dismissed. A bottle of lavender oil. Sheets of dark and royal blue paper. A half formed origami flower. A week’s worth of letters and flowers awaiting mail call to be sent out into the world.
Tears blurred his words, running the ink. Her apartment. Dark, save a single lamp. Six weeks since their last visit. Now, there’d be none. They’d buried him under the prison. No sunlight. No human contact. Only books and mail that he’d written. Curled on her sofa, rocking, she clutched his letters and flowers. Kissing his words, ‘Love always, A Villain.’
“I do love you,” she sighed.
“Hey uh…” she hesitated, “uh, what kinda flowers are those?”
Amused, he stared over a shoulder at the new guard. Finally, he smiled, “they’re orchids.”"

In the garage sat two golf carts plugged into an electric outlet. I must admit, I was eager to take one for a spin around the lovely island. Since I am an adventurer and golf carts were the only means of transportation, I would get plenty of opportunities to explore in one.
I drove all over and around that island in that week, even went places where there were no roads. One time we stayed out a bit too late. As the sun set, it got real dark out there on those winding narrow roads. With no headlights and a light drizzle in the dark, it felt like we were in a rainforest or something. It was great! It was almost as if more wildlife came out after the sun and set on the island. As I struggled to see the road that led to our return that night, a raccoon ran out in front of us. That was close call #2-- I almost ran over a raccoon. But somehow we made it.
We did a lot of sightseeing on the island that week. We visited a museum, hiked a lot of trails, climbed Old Baldy-- their lighthouse. We even saw a family of alligators up close. I almost got bit by one! That was close call #3. Nah just kidding, but there is another close call coming up, I promise.
On the last day of our island vacation we had rented a kayak to tour around in on the water, she hated the marsh. I guess we had stayed out there far too long because she got sunburned pretty bad. Her pale, bright, fair skin always just seemed to turn pink under the sun. I even gave her my T-shirt to cover her badly burned legs with. The sun didn’t burn me so much, but I had to take her to the hospital to treat her 2nd degree burns after we got back.
It was there on Bald Head Island, that week in 2008, that I had decided, I knew I wanted to marry that girl. Shortly thereafter, I bought her a princess cut diamond ring. While she did say yes and I believed her, I now realize that I had made some unfortunate decisions that would eventually tear us apart. Close call #3 (as promised) I almost got married to my Jenny."

If it ended up with the goose anyway?

Pulling itself up so high

To take it’s life into danger,
With people’s carriages,
on city streets!
With human beings,

Was it lured by the smell of milk from the baby’s bottle?
Or was it some anthropomorphic moment, and I thought the fox would open up full throttle?
Taking stroller, goose, baby, and all,
Down the sidewalk to a shopping mall?
Pretty and clean.
Like a baby’s carriage should be,
I really never ever thought I would see,
Or even a fox pushing a stroller!
Or even, a fox taking a peek inside,
This infant’s roller!

I wonder what she hates -- me? I wouldn’t doubt it.”
Carter’s continued mental meanderings reached critical mass, and imploded into uncertainty. But, he slowly transported himself back through the infinity of time and space, toward the threshold of reality. His focus materialized, back to the monotony of the threadbare visitation room he was in with his estranged daughter.
He knew it was time now. Carter pushed the knot in his throat aside, with a dull fleshy thud. His bladder chimed in, to pester him with a resonating pang to be emptied. He closed his legs tightly, in hopes to keep the sudden swell at bay. Simultaneously, he dried his clammy mits at his sides.
Carter exhaled the remaining residue of fear from his body. His hands began the seemingly mile-long journey across the generic plastic table, that separated him from his legacy. He softly enveloped the delicate, and colorfully manicured, fingers of his daughter’s right hand. He cleared his throat again, with the stuttered clatter of an orchestra conductor. The symphony of emotions within him were ready to begin their heartfelt melody. His head rose to find his daughter’s countenance, receptive and attentive.
The words fought for stability on Carter’s tongue, like towering monoliths wavering to the earthquaking forces of nature. He held onto them though, through the vise-like grip of his teeth, not letting the words fall and crumble away. Small streams were building to a teary waterfall in his eyes. The words were pushed to the very edge of his mouth, ready to freefall into the depths of his daughter’s heart.
“Elena… Elena I -- I’m SORRY,” Carter voiced with unfathomable sincerity. Heavy tears began to drop from his lids, like a refreshing summer rain, saturating his state jumper. Elena’s own misting eyes gave way, and pushed forth a flood of biblical proportions. Raging torrents were rushing down the lovely contours of her face, and dotting her dress with the abstract symbols of relief and forgiveness.
It was finally finished.
Now, they could start…

I was told walking and a good diet will help reduce the weight and add back to my body. Well, back here if this is called a diet, then someone give me a bucket of grease.
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself where has my health gone. I am still here, but not the same person as I once was. As I said earlier, I have had surgery on my heart and neck. A few stitches later and I still get around. This isn’t something I wanted done to change my looks. It was to stay alive. That is why I don’t complain too much about my body.
Would I like to be anyone else? NO! That wouldn’t be me. So when you look in that mirror like I have, don’t put yourself down. Who I am and who you are are very important to our parents, siblings, friends, and most of all, to the world.
It doesn’t matter if you change the way you look on the outside. You are still you on the inside. Why would it be of my interest to change everything to please someone else, for them to then get tired of the way I look, to leave and find someone else?
Just like how the late Joan Rivers said, “I have had so much plastic surgery over the years. I can’t tell if I am smiling. Am I smiling?” The worst part of that is what doctors have done will soon come undone. Gravity will soon find and pull everything south. Even the best plastic surgeons can’t stop what is a natural part of our life.
This is my body and no knife toting doctor is going to change my face features to please anyone else. I ask that if you do decide to alter your body with anything like tattoos, plastic surgery, or anything that would take away from your looks, think really hard before you do it. I have and will not do anything to my body that wasn’t already there to start with. Besides, I love the way I look already."

She was going on about the glass being gone, people in the house with masks. We’ll get her to calm down, breathe, and focus when she gets here.”
“I’m sorry sir,” the waitress said, returning, “We are unable to move your party. We will do our best to make her comfortable when she arrives.”
“Oh-kay,” came the surprised and affronted reply as she strode off. He and Denton looked about. Several tables for four or more stood vacant at Marcelle’s. Most of the tables near the stage were occupied with patrons dining and drinking until Peaux Das took the stage which was being set up.
“Don’t get that one, Dent. There are plenty of places we can move to.”
“Yup.”
“Never seen a table reserved here before.”
“Nope.”
“So why the sudden change in --- She said, ‘her.’ I said ‘third party.’ How did she know it was a female coming?” He began to rise, but a hand appeared on his shoulder, stopping him.
“Remain seated, Jon.”
Denton and Jon looked as if a ghost had walked in, and one might just have. “You’ve got timing, Dave. Your wife’s coming along soon,” said Denton when he noticed Jon was stunned silent.
“We need to discuss that. You boys come out back with me. This here is too crowded.” The two rose, and the group went out a side door into the humid summer air. Frogs croaked from the lake out back. Now and then, there was a swish of water from a gator moving about. Pelicans silhouetted themselves on the crimson sky of a setting southern sun. It would be beautiful if the world wasn’t being rocked right now.
“I tried my best to keep Jenn in the dark. She’s always been safer that way. But, you guys digging into this one has kicked the ant hill. You gotta get her to safety. You two, also. They have names now as well.”
“Who, Dave?” asked an emotional Jon. “You’ve been gone four weeks without a word. What did you expect her to do? Sit and wait?”
“I can’t say who. All I can tell you is back away now to save yourselves. I’ve done all---”
They were suddenly surrounded by ten men with guns. A van pulled up on the lawn, doors slid open, and a couple of the men started to pull out equipment. A short ruddy-looking man came out of the van. “Gentleman, sorry to interrupt. But, we’re on a deadline. Hold them,” he told his men.
Jon and Denton were held down as they were forced to watch Dave be wrapped in head to toe in plastic wrap. Holes were cut out for his eyes and mouth, and weights were tied to his legs with chains.
“Come, gentlemen. We have an opening act to perform.”
There was almost pandemonium as a troupe of men entered the restaurant fully armed. Orders from the little man kept everyone in their seats. Jon and Dent were led to the table where Jenn, a scared look on her face, sat. She almost jumped as Dave was carried in and placed on the stage for all to see, but Dent kept her quiet.
“Ladies and Gentlemen. Tonight is just one act. We call it ‘Lesson.’ A nod from the dwarf and a man threw a match on Dave. He was covered in flames in mere seconds. Then, all hell broke loose.
They had to drag Jenn who was screaming Dave’s name over and over with them as they avoided being trampled from the mob. Outside, the scene was just as bad. A pileup had blocked the parking lot, so they opted to continue with the mass of people running down the street. A few blocks down, they took a side street to separate from the group and to see if they were followed.
At the end of the street was a ravine flowing with a torrent of sewage water. A hand bridge provided a way across, but a five foot split in the ground separated them from using it. Jon noticed an alley to their left.
“Dent, you and Jenn see if there is a way to the bridge. I’ll check this alley.” A nod from each, and then Jon went down the dark walk. He didn’t have to go far. Twenty feet in, it turned left again to end at some business’s backdoor and a dumpster. He retraced his steps to tell the others, but they were not there on his return. He walked to the bridge and noticed the crevice was gone. A rolling mass of grass was between him and the bridge now. As the sod moved, gas bubbles erupted, leaving something white underneath. He picked up a fallen branch and began to prod the ground. He found a seam and flipped over the sod.
Under it was a mass of flesh and bone. Under the grass and in the ground, rows and rows of what looked like miniature shark teeth. A gas bubble burst, moving the top of the mass. Denton’s face looked at him with dead eyes. He dropped the stick and ran.
What the hell is happening!?! His thoughts screamed. He ran a few blocks until he was before a housing complex. Picking up a book at the front entrance, he attempted to look like a casual occupant returning to his room. He ducked down one hallway and was halfway through when every door opened, and an intercom announced, “Dinner-time.”
Men in white shirts, pants, and slippers shuffled in the hallway, filed in line, and made their way out.
“I’m in a mental hospital.” He slipped into a room to hide out, but the men in there had not yet left, forcing him out. He tried to go out the rear, but the place was surrounded by police. He was taken around back by a couple of them, cuffed up, and one of them took the butt of his rifle to his head.
Next thing Jon knew, he was looking out some material covering his face and body. He saw he was still at the mental place. He got up and ran. Flee first. Plan when escaped. A few miles down the road, he slipped into an alley to assess his wounds.
He was trussed up in some fabric. He could see out of it and it covered his body. Finding a sharp corner of a brick, he finally cut into a corner into the section covering his hands. He did not find his hands inside. Bones protruded instead.
A long rant of freaking out followed the discovery. Looking at a mirror in the trash, he saw he was all bones in a sack. After a series of debates, he settled on one: Find a Voodoo Man.
He knew of one, down in the Ninth Ward. He had worked on some cases with him. He made it to thut in the dawning hours. He was glad that the night hid him from casual eyes. Jax Dubois thought at first that he was a specter coming for revenge. After proving who he was, Jax worked to undo the spell on him.
Success came only part way. Jon was restored to an adolescent. “At least I am alive,” he said. As a child, he had to find help. He knew of a friend who taught at a local elementary school. Jax dropped him off there.
It was strange to be at a school again and of age for it, too. He strolled the halls looking for his friend’s class. Passing a row of lockers, two young students smiled at him. He smiled back and then stopped. Their teeth were glowing pearly white. They opened their jaws, and he was suddenly filled with the vision of flesh and rows of teeth inside their mouths just like the ground. He fled the school grounds as fast as a kid could go.
As he exited the gates and turned to go right, movement to the left caught his eye. Two forms lumbered towards him. They were covered in a familiar fabric and had chains on them. His feet felt frozen as they continued on towards closer to him. One spoke to him. A final straw.
“Don’t run, Jon. You can’t run. Just give in,” came Jenn’s voice.
Jonathan screamed."

With extended deployments enabling them to be positioned over high risk zones ahead of time, response times are dramatically reduced. Traditional aircraft are limited in both accuracy and capacity for extinguishing fires. A Sentinel can approach an area slowly at low attitude using camera guided water cannons and flame retardant. Thermal imaging allows them to view areas obscured by smoke.
Their performance as a humanitarian relief platform proved itself to be indispensable in the aftermath of hurricane Xavier. Ejection pod systems dropped food, water, medicine and every other imaginable necessity. When speakers instructed the being lowered by winch cable, people actually thought there was a pilot on board giving instructions. Once they found themselves safely inside the aircraft, a video cam-link system allowed them to speak with controllers. This interaction with those being rescued provided valuable intelligence in real time about those still trapped in devastated areas.
Information is interfaced through an amazing network of advanced systems. Satellite impute, ground controller, and artificial intelligence are integrated to assure the highest level of performance. Each Sentinel has the capacity to function autonomously, as well as come together en masse to cover complex problems over large areas. Homeland Security and local law enforcement groups alike have repeated having success stories in threatening terrorist attacks and all manner of criminal endeavours.
Tragedy was narrowly averted when a senator's daughter was found deep in the woods at night. The Sentinels forward looking infa-red sensors were able to spot her and her kidnapper and track them until law enforcement could intercept them. Still another instance was when a congressman himself was pulled from frigid waters after his boat capsized in a storm.
It’s sad that it takes these near misses happening to our aristocratic elite before they’re willing to lobby lawmakers for change. Everybody has known for a long time that the lives of the general public take a back seat to special interest dollars filling politicians’ pockets. Social justice, public safety, and human rights are nice catch phrases during the election campaigns. But once they’re in office they’re blinded by the corruption of power and manipulation and deception become business as usual."

Sometimes she buys things six months prior to actually wearing it.
Management tells Madison it’s closing time. She sweet talks him. She tells him her engagement was called off three days ago and she got kicked out. He of course feels bad. He tells her to take all the time she needs.
We finally get all of Madison’s stuff in her unit. That’s when I notice she has no furniture. I ask why. She says they were supposed to deliver yesterday and they still have not shown up. She says she’s sleeping on the floor. I force myself not to laugh. I go out to the balcony.
She knows exactly what I’m thinking. She says she knows she had a better view at the old place. I say that from this balcony I can see the ants on the sidewalk. From her old place, you can’t even see the sidewalk. She comes out to the balcony. She does see ants on the sidewalk and laughs.
I ask how much she’s paying for the unit. She says the rent is two thousand. I tell her it’s a complete waste of money. She says Andrew’s place cose seven thousand dollars per month.
She is very thankful that I helped her move. She tells me to keep quiet for a couple of weeks. She wants to get herself together before she starts telling everyone she is no longer getting married to Andrew."

To me the word zoo was how I felt inside. I didn’t know which way to go. I didn’t know if I was going to be like a caged animal sometimes, I felt angry and anxious all of the time.
Zoo can also mean how hectic our lives are each and every day. On the outside my life was hectic. I literally thought I was going crazy. I didn’t have enough time for myself. At that time I was using drugs. I thought my world was ok, little did I know that it was going to crumble in pieces. Then it did and since 2007, I have been serving a 25 year sentence.
I’m not at all proud of my crime. Being in prison is also like a zoo. You have inmates locked in seg., or I-max on a 23 hour lockdown policy, just depends where you’re at. The people wardens are caretakers like at a zoo. There’s also teachers who teach us things.
So, what it comes down to is how we see our lives. We don’t have to feel like a zoo, we can always go to classes and educate ourselves.
I’m sitting in my cell on the MHU Pod 4. I’m back in prison now. I got transferred last Wednesday. Now I can get help; I can take grief classes. I am happy I’m back. I know I’ll be alright.
If I could take a picture of what I look like in the mornings you would all think I belong in a zoo. LOL.
On a serious note, there’s always our loved ones who care about us and when we are at the zoo, just always remember we were at one point in our lives in a zoo, locked up or not."

As I sat in the silence of awestruck wonder, I knew my concerns were many. Where could I even begin? “Just love me” I softly whispered. I felt the tears trickle down my cheeks and suddenly, my concerns began to flow freely from my broken heart of despair.
“God, are you able to peer into my eyes and gaze upon my very soul? Are you the light of love that can pierce my inner darkness? Can you see the iron gates that imprison my broken heart? Are you able to break the chains and fetters that so sternly bind me down? Can the power of your love open this dark tomb that blinds me from your truth? Your word says that you love me - yet, are you able to feel my pain? Can you see my inner struggles, my hidden secrets, the depths of my scars?”
“Could you possibly know my dreams - my deep desire to fly free? Is your mercy able to forgive my faults and receive me as I am? Will you cleanse my hidden shame and wash me whiter than snow? Will you hold my hand with fingers locked and guide me through my trials - my tribulations? Just love me God - though I am hidden - a diamond covered by darkened sin. Show me compassion, that I too may show others compassion. Heal my pains, that I too may heal the pains of others. Dry my tears, that I too may dry the tears of others.”
“Shatter these iron gates that imprison my broken heart. Open this dark tomb and let my soul fly free! Just love me God, that I may learn to love you. Give to me your tender mercy, your gracious grace, the sweetness of your passion. Teach me God to show others tender mercy, gracious grace, and sweetened passion. Give to me the unfeigned love that I so desire, That I too may learn to give you the unfeigned love you so desire. Today God, I surrender my broken life at the throne of your grace. Just love me, my Father, my Savior, just love me.”
As I cried in the serenity of my Creator, I heard His quiet still voice whisper on the winds of change, “I am here. I will never leave you nor forsake you. In your times of need, call upon my name. I will uphold you with my right hand and lead you through the valley of the shadows of death in your turbulent world. When you seek me, you will find me. In me you will find peace. In me, my child, you will find rest for your weary soul.” The weight of the world lifted from shoulders as I wept in freedom. Oh that day! That wonderful, wonderful day!
I opened my eyes and stared at the pearly gates of heaven. I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that I had been basking under the rainbow of God’s radiant love. God heard my concerns - my plea for help - He led me to His golden gates of freedom. As I confessed my sins, God faithfully forgave me of all my sins and washed me whiter than snow. He broke the chains and fetters and opened the lid to my dark tomb of despair and now I fly free in God’s kingdom of indescribable joy. Oh, the splendor of God’s amazing grace - how sweet the sound. I once was lost - now I’m found. I was blind - now I see - my Heavenly Father’s love for me!
My friends, if you too feel trapped behind the mountains of fear and doubt, simply go to a place of solitude, close your eyes and humble yourself before God’s throne of grace and ask Him to forgive your sins. He will be faithful and forgive all your past sins and give your life a brand new start. He will lift your heavy burdens and open your dark tomb of despair. God will allow you to spread your wings and fly free in His majestical kingdom of unfeigned love. My friends, there is no sweeter melody than that of God’s tender voice whispering on the winds of change - “I am here!”
Love Always In Christ,

That included myself. “Junior,” she called out. “Oh mom,” let me sleep for a little while longer. One thing I did learn and fast; she would not call you twice. There was a price to pay for that.
I do believe that dad must have had ESP-I'm not talking about extra sensory perception-what comes to mind Is extra slow perception! It took him forever to come home. He would show back up after everything was done.
The sun felt great on my back. My sister would tease me at how dark I would turn during the summer months. I can still hear mom say to my sister. “Leave him alone If you are going to finish today.” I’d smile at her, but I knew by that look, I had better keep an eye on her.
Breaks would come ever so often. One thing I can say about mom. We had plenty of cold sweet tea. She too stayed busy with bologna In a cast iron skillet. A couple of sandwiches was all It took for myself. Now that I am older, bologna now causes a rash to appear. What I used to love, now has turned against me.
I could handle lifting my end of the furniture. Since my sister was four years older than me, we managed together to bring out the last two items. Did I say the last two? Correction on that. Once I lifted my end of the dresser, I knew the mistake was too late. Flip-Flops are not to be worn doing jobs like this.
The bottom of the dresser skinned my big toe; but that was just a slight taste of the pain to come. My whole foot was In pain. The weight of the dresser rested on top of it. Thank goodness we never had carpet. Solid wood floors are a lot easier to clean.
I really do understand why my father never decided to be home when all of this was taking place. Oh yeah, I did let out a yell. This alarmed mom. My sister had to go all around the house to reach me. I knew she didn't do this to me on purpose. It seemed like forever when she lifted the dresser off my foot. Mom could only look in shock.
I didn't want to look or touch it. When I asked mom how It looked. All I got was “Umh! Umh!” That sure wasn't good news. The skin was broken and I sure could feel blood.
There was a wonder oil we used a lot. It relieves pain, soreness, and promotes skin healing. It is called red oil. It can be bought at a drugstore. Do remember I lived in the south.
Over the years, I found an easier way to move things without hurting my foot. A regular broom and a towel you can move just about anything. Lifting the heavy items up, place a towel on the floor, Place the broom on top of the towel, just center of the four red threaded lines, pulling with the handle. It will move it across the room.
When I got married and spring fever bit my wife, I pitched in and cleaned the rooms. One thing that did help was I wore boots and was careful where my feet were placed.
Unlike my father, I enjoyed cleaning the house. I have thanked my mother over the years for teaching me how to cook, wash clothes, iron, and to be thankful for the things In life we take for granted.
My sister and I are still close. All she has to do is ask and I will help her. Even if she has spring fever."

Barefoot Sally giggled.
Pete dug into his pocket with his free hand for his last two pennies. One for her, one for him. He would get twenty-five more next week for taking out the garbage and bagging the lawn clippings. He would spend all that on Barefoot Sally as well, bubblegum and sweets.
“Stay still,” smiled Pete.
With great apprehension, Pete released her hand. Barefoot Sally was a daredevil, had them jump off a bridge once, all because she saw it in a movie. Pete watched her, lost himself in her green eyes, but her eyes were elsewhere, fixed, staring down the tracks. PEte kneeled, placed both pennies on the rail, mere inches in front of her bare feet.
The horn wailed again, much closer now, a glint of its headlight piercing the fog...really close.
Barefoot Sally squeaked. Pete jumped to his feet. Sally reached out her hands, fingers wiggling him closer. She was stranded on the rail. Pete had carried her over the jagged rocks earlier that morning, piggyback style.
“Hurry,” she begged and squirmed.
Pete smiled, carrying Barefoot Sally was the highlight of any day. Before Pete could turn around to give her his back, Barefoot Sally squeaked again then launched herself airborne. It was all Pete could do to hold his ground, her arms and legs spread wide, she flew through the air into his arms, bare legs wrapping instantly around his waist. This was new. Her arms wrapped around his neck as she tucked her face into his long blonde hair, like a strawberry vanilla swirl.
“Hurry,” she shivered, her breath upon his ear igniting shivers of their own.
Pete looked up. The locomotive broke free of the fog, a big old diesel, brown and rusty, angry and huffing. It blew its horn again, more angry, more urgent. The ground began to rattle, it was time to run. It was like carrying an overgrown child but Pete managed to run them off the tracks, down the embankment, and into a bush before the train was upon them. Pete spun around back towards the tracks then carefully lay down in the bush, Barefoot Sally beneath him. There was no reason to give the caboose easy targets for their pepper guns.
Barefoot Sally leaned her head back to watch the passing train. Pete’s eyes were glued to her freckled long neck. Her body was mashed to his, she had not unwound her legs or arms. A breeze from the passing train wafted both of their hair, puffing at their faces, creating a little slice of heaven. Pete tingled from head to toe.
It was now or never. He had tried before but his timing was never just right. Green eyes left the train. Blue eyes never left her face. Green on blue, blue on green, they leaned, they met, they kissed. Shots fired! Not the pepper guns, it was fireworks bursting inside Pete’s mind. Soft, gentle, moist, tender, everything he thought it would be, and so much more. Their lips parted, their tongues met, what he thought would be heaven was only the matinee."

My papa would literally spend the prior week planning it. My mom would tell him, “You are mad with all of these preparations!” He would plan and replan down to what live animal he would slaughter then cook up. One year, it was a hog right off a farm in Camarillo, California where my primo Hueno worked. I recall another year where he brought home a goat that he tied in the backyard. That was the year he slaughtered a calf we raised ourselves. I remember my seventh birthday, feeding this calf grass and feeling sorry for this creature. I was admonished and told not to feed an animal that’s already prepared for our slaughter.
About forty-five minutes later, my papa grabbed this huge butcher’s knife while his friends held the animal down, and just like that my papa went at it, starting at the throat.
I didn’t watch the rest of the slaughter, but stood around once music started blasting. The fiesta was on! It’s strange and funny how I can still vividly remember that particular birthday that we celebrated. And now here’s the best part, I was always first to open presents. My Papa loved to watch me with his huge proud smile.
My Nina Sylvia, who always called me by “Mi Rey,” gave the best presents. Whether it was my birthday or Christmas, I could always count on my Nina for the best toys. The woman knew her way to a kid’s heart. Visits by Nina were always accompanied by plenty of kisses and a gift. What a privilege it was to be loved by my Nina.
My childhood was so happy when my papa was alive and healthy. He even started his own contracting business with only a second grade education from Mexico. He was a pillar of the small community where was known for getting the job done and treating clients just like family, no matter who they were. He taught me a lot of life’s lessons that I carry with me until this day. How special is all that? Don’t ask because I could go on forever telling you about my papa. The man my mom loved wholeheartedly, made all the sacrifices to maintain his vows, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part. My mom was his backbone and kept him truly humble. She would often taunt him when he got worked up.
“Que genio!” she called. “El famoso coraje.”
He was a man slow to answer, but watch out because he was an incredibly proactive man of action. On August 14th I not only celebrate the day I was born, but also the life of this great man who took part in giving me life. He will always be remembered as my idol. Happy Birthday Senor!"

The recession of the 2000s shook the foundations upon which all levels of office stood, and as a result, questions and audits ensued, knocking a lot of rotten apples and dead limbs out of governmental trees nationwide...For that, I am thankful. It means that the suffering through which we went was not in vain, because not all, but many of those responsible for the financial collapse were forced out of office. Now, new computer algorithms keep better tabs on what’s going on. No more “hidden books.” The whole political game has changed.
The problem, currently, is that some still try to hold onto days of the past, and they learn, one by one, that the Internet (as a medium for the people’s voice) keeps them on a virtual leash, as every act they perform, good or bad, gets judged by the web-surfing voters at large.
I’m thankful for this new information age that makes political corruption and law enforcement manipulations, biases, and corruptions known. Bad laws, and contradictory or outdated legal ideologies are brought to light. Publications like Prisoner Express give voices to those of us stuck inside a broken prison system that’s forgotten its purpose: rehabilitation. The public is now being made aware of our tax dollars being diverted from rehabilitation and used instead for the cheapest form of warehousing. And for that exposure, I am thankful.
I am thankful for those that work to expose corruption.
On my MIT hosted blog:
http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/316
I constantly exercise my right to free speech. The prisons were a little reluctant at first in its allowance--but, now, ten years into it … they respect the truth. And for that, I’m not only thankful, but I returned the respect by only writing of factual events in my snail-mailed posts, and trying always to tell things from both sides, and all angles. Over the years, I think it’s helped me to become a better write, and a better person.
Writing, has been my mode of personal growth.
I’m thankful for those here trying to repair the Southern Justice System, as they call it. Driving out its impurities wherever found. If we could only get a non-conformed, fresh set of candidates to run for South Carolina Governor, and lower offices. We need someone to turn the whole “good ole boy” system on its head. We don’t need another “Trickie Nikki” or another F-ing lawyer in the office. We need someone with science in their background, that goes by the facts instead of the prayer circle and the bank deposit record. We need a complete state-wide rebuild, one that will bring South Carolina up to par with other states in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Get us out of the bottom five (or so) in the nation and up past the 25 positions. Is South Carolina reaching at least the middle too much to ask? I hate that the education here is so low. More resources need to be devoted to STEM, and liberal arts! The prison population of S.C.’s future will be greatly reduced by changes in the laws--making them more fair-- and a devotion to education, not just of the current prison population, but of all schools statewide of all ages.
I’m not the only one that sees this.
And some are actively trying to change it. And for that, I’m thankful. Our current DEFAULT governor, represents the old South Carolina. He’s the kind to take offense from an essay like this--despite its truth. The South Carolina Department of Corrections, SCDC, is--post-economic-fall--going through some changes, to say the least. It’s now obvious to the public, that laws set in place in the mid- to late ‘90s, are no longer sustainable, or even make sense. So, those laws that screwed everything up, are now being revisited-- and some have already been changed. And for that, we are ALL thankful. A complete sentencing reformation is inevitable. The only way to reduce the killings taking place here, will be to put hope back into the hearts and minds of prisoners. A prisoner without hope, or any human (or animal) without hope-- is a dangerous thing.
So, if you’re an honest, unbiased, science savvy person in need of a legacy--come to South Carolina, run for office, show them how it’s done. And for that, we’ll ALL be thankful."
2162,“Emerging from the Fog” by Timothy Finley,,No,2018.0,06 - June,Word Theme Essay,https://www.notion.so/Emerging-From-the-Fog-030a89775d564ee29a4948bd452f5dc7,Katie Kwak,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTSLHeSvd0AVPoP7x1ymsnJ2S89ufigpulJXLisj5-w/edit,No,"We tend to judge women on two fronts: emotions and sexual exploitation. We believe that because they’re overly emotional they make irrational decisions. We only think this because as men we are not commonly wired with emotions so when you’re not equipped with something you lack understanding of it, and this leads us to judgment. Emotions are what make you human and separate us from the wildlife.
Also, maybe you’ve been wronged by a woman before, or seen it happen. Don’t let a few faltering incidents set the tone for your reception of women as a whole. “Judge as you want to be judged.” Because if you’re being honest and fair, then you should take no offense if a woman judges you on the actions of, say, a “Harvey Weinstein.” Would you rather be known as an emotional or a sexual predator? Me, personally, I’m going to get started on crying a river.
Harvey Weinstein… this name is why I find myself participating in this theme. To me, “emerging from the fog” means women are finally getting recognition publically for what’s been happening since Eve stepped out of the garden. The “me, too” movement is just the beginning. But I think there needs to be more, we need to be tracking more than just celebrity profiles. What about those that aren’t being heard? There needs to be a network channel based strictly on sexual harassment, assaults and abuse. Sex offenders being broadcast, support groups on the network, issues on trafficking. The tracking of a criminal and civil cases, a wanted list, etc. Maybe Ellen could start a network like Oprah started her own.
Until this issue is tackled as a whole with 24/7 coverage, these issues will continue to exist. It’s going to take a collective group. And ladies, don’t be scared to lose your job or promotion. Stand up for yourself, keep the momentum going. Also, ladies, don’t take offense but some of you need to quit adding fuel to the fire with the voluntary prostitution, porn, stripping, exposing your bodies. All these things plant seeds of preexisting fantasies, which plays a role in how men operate sexually. You must limit that arousal so that you’re not putting yourself at risk.
The bottom line is “you” have to change men’s perception and until that’s done it’s a perpetual vicious cycle. Now I understand that some or a lot of the times an assault will occur that can’t be stopped because of force. There’s only one answer to those types of men, and it’s called a firing squad! So focus on the things you do have control over and “emerge from the fog”...
If you are interested in sharing thoughts, I’m very diverse. Please add your address in the letter, as Michigan mail policy is prohibiting us from receiving envelopes with the address on them."

I enjoy looking at tomorrow. So, my past days got lost like eyelashes. I laugh because people pay attention to just about every hair on their bodies, but only a small percentage of them ever look at the loss of eyelashes. Nobody counts them! But when I realize one has fallen, even if it ends up on my fingertip when I wash the sleep out of my eyes every morning, I smile and let it wash away like nothing. They grow back, just like possibilities of our futures. But when we lose them, we don’t even notice. To me, that gives me a good way to look at the future.
In essence, because 20 years went by quickly, I do consider it like passing in a “blink of an eye,” or to my estimation, 92 eyelashes. Yep, it doesn’t feel like yesterday, it feels like tomorrow."

Harris,,No,2018.0,07 - July,Word Theme Essay,https://www.notion.so/Weddings-ef5ca531c72442c7a00d32a5cb6c988c,Katie Kwak,"February 21, 2021 4:48 AM",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xm4-LAHCz9725S4iNQfcO1f4zzOvI_oVgXi-6uIqAi0/edit,No,"I used to try to rationalize my behavior by telling myself “I was young, and high all the time.” Then I remembered that that bitch was the one who seduced me and introduced me to drugs. Those were that bitch’s friends, not mine. I never knew them until I met “tha game”.
I also look around. There are many, many young guys behind these walls who dated “tha game” and never got high. Never even smoked a joint. Yet, they’re in the same exact predicament as I am. So I can’t blame my poor choice on my youth or on getting high- although they surely didn’t help matters at all. Now, the next red flag that should have told me that bitch wasn’t right for me was that the bitch wanted me to to have “power” and “money.” (I was only twelve years old). But, I was so captivated by the bitch that I joined a gang, started selling drugs and played around with weapons to carry out violence against anyone who challenged me. Whether it was a rock, a brick, a stick, bat, a knife or a gun. Whatever it took, I used it.
Through my displays of violence, willingness to fight and to do anything I had to do to survive, I gained a reputation (among my peers). I was considered “thorough,” “real,” “a stand up ni##a,” “a rider,” and “one of the Lords.” Although, looking back, that really wasn't such a good thing. Because eventually, I got put on the police’s radar. Once you get on the police’s radar, you are guaranteed to see the inside of a jail cell sooner or later.
Besides, having a reputation like that couldn’t get me far in life anyway. Unless I chose to limit myself. Because in reality, gang members are a minority inside of a minority. So their social, political and economical power is superficial, almost non-existent.
That is not to say that gang members have no potential, or that gangs in general have no influence. They do. Just not on a scale large enough to have any real, substantial impact on the social, political and economic issues that actually affect us the most. Because they exist, not as one, but as too many different fractions.
Nevertheless, I stayed faithful to “tha game”. Yet, even though I sold drugs, I stayed broke. Because I had no real concept of “economies.” Remember, technically I dropped out of standardized school at the age of twelve. That’s why I had no real substantial concept of finance.
Sure, I knew money could buy “things.” But I didn’t really comprehend the value of money. Not until I was well into my thirties. So, just like many young and naive people, I wasted my money on a host of insignificant “things.” Too many to list them all here. But, you get the picture.
Now, don’t get me wrong, me and “tha game” had a lot of good times together. She introduced me to a lot of good people and we had many great, fun and exciting experiences. I wouldn’t be the man I am today had it not been for “tha game”. And I do appreciate that, and I cherish that (gunshot wounds and all).
But, at the same time, I’ve come to realize that “tha game” is what had been holding me back all this time. You see, the only times in my life that I ever really sat down to learn and educate myself about the world were when I was incarcerated. However, I never really did any amount of real significant time (before this time), so my educational experiences had been sporadic. That’s because every time I got out of jail or prison, I was right back to running the streets. Right back to “tha game” and the same ole things, drugs, guns and violence. It became a cycle. I was running in place.
Then came the pivotal point in my life where the state had given me enough time to really sit down and to study to educate myself. I started reading a lot (just as Malcolm X did). I devoured every book I got my hands on. I didn’t discriminate. I had to study the law, so I used to read dozens of case laws everyday. Then I started writing legal briefs, petitions, etc. Eventually I became proficient in both criminal and civil rights law.
Simultaneously, I studied other subjects such as history, philosophy, Psychology/Social psychology, political science, and business. I also would read autobiographies and biographies written by and about successful people. I read self-help and motivational books. I even studied the concepts of several religions including Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and even scientology and satanism.
But all the wisdom, knowledge and understanding I’ve acquired has been beneficial and/or conducive to my future success. The study of slavery and the development of America from different perspectives than the perspectives of those caucasians that contributed to the American history textbooks I was told to read in school had the most profound effect on me and my contemporary point of view. Compounded by my growing knowledge of psychology/social psychology and politics, I came to understand how “the system,” which has become a self-sustaining institution for the oppression and exploitation of all “minorities” (whether white, black, hispanic, or Asian) that had been developed by the so-called founding fathers of this country psychologically conditions many young men and women to believe they’re “powerless” so they will submerge into subterranean cultures (i.e. tha game).
The so-called “powerless” cling to guns, drugs and other forms of criminality as their only source of “power” because they/we do not realize we have “options.” That’s why jails, juvenile detention centers and prisons all across this country are up and running at full capacity. Because we’re psychologically conditioned by “the system” (in many different ways) to feel “powerless.” In psychology it’s called “behaviorism” or “behavior modification.”
But, boy oh boy, can you imagine the day when the so-called “powerless” wake up from the “American Dream” and realize just how powerful we really are? It can happen. It will happen one day. I woke up…
What happened to my marriage to “tha game”, you ask? Well, like I said, “until death do us part.” To me, that bitch is so dead."

Whether it be my journal, some poetry, or a piece of fiction I might be working on, when I’m engrossed in my writing I’m not in this 7 by 9 foot cage. With pen in hand, I’m free of this prison of hate, fear, racism, ignorance and oppression. I’m free of my many problems and my numerous issues. Once I turn my writer’s imagination on, I am truly alive. I’m free to slip into my very own world; free to lock the door, throw the bolt, draw the shades, and lose myself. I don’t have to worry about always having to hide my emotions or my kindness. I can truly relax and be me. If it were possible, I would buy a one way ticket leaving right now. I wouldn’t even pack.
I must now learn how to harness my demons and use them as fuel for my writing, fuel for my pen. Being locked in a room with one’s demons can either be dangerous or beneficial and in order to make it out of this gulag alive and somewhat sane I must learn to master my nemesis, my forever opponent. If by chance I can harness and then channel my nemesis into my writing so I can then create, not only fiction, but a voice so those going through the same thing will know they’re not alone, to be able to help someone with my vowels and consonants, will be well worth the despair and sorrow. To let someone know it’s okay to feel the way they’re feeling, to show them a way out, is worth the torment.
This is what I must master, what I must overcome. Now that I’ve started writing once again, started thinking once again, I’ll never stop creating, never stop sharpening my skill. I can’t afford to lose the high ground that I’ve conquered, the little bit of progress I’ve made. These are the things I must deal with since emerging from the fog."

“Train!” blurted Pete.
Pete dug into his pocket with his free hand, pulling out two pennies, his last two pennies, One for her, one for him. Next week he would get twenty-five more for taking out the trash and bagging the lawn clippings.
“Stay still,” demanded Pete.
Apprehension welled in his chest as he let go of her hand. Sally was a daredevil, wild to the core, once had them jump from a bridge just because she saw it in a movie. Pete watched her, dared her to move, but her green eyes were elsewhere, fixed on the distant fog. Pete placed the pennies on the rail, mere inches in front of her bare feet.
The horn wailed again, this time much closer, a glint of its headlight peeking through the fog...really close,
Sally squeaked. Pete jumped to his feet. Sally reached out with her hands, fingers wiggling expectantly. She was stranded on the rail. Pete had piggybacked her across the jagged rocks earlier that morning.
“Hurry,” she begged.
Pete smiled. The ground began to shake.
“Kiss me,” asked Pete.
“Don’t be silly,” her fingers waved him closer. “Come get me, the train is getting closer.”
Pete gulped. “Kiss me.”
The horn blared, louder now, angry. The pennies were shaking.
“HURRY!” Sally’s eyes were frantic.
“KISS ME!” Pete had to yell now, just to be heard over the road of the engine, nearly all-consuming, fast approaching.
Barefoot Sally jumped from the rail into his arms, arms and legs wrapping him tight. She kissed him. Pete snaked his arms around her waist and hugged her for all she was worth. Her bare legs cinched tighter around his waist. Pete turned toward the train. She kissed him deep, tongue and all.
The train engulfed them, roaring right through them.
And then it was gone. A crushing silence. Everything was gone. No trees rustling in the wind. No critters scurrying in the bush. No jagged rocks. No roaring train. The rail that held her dainty bare feet, gone. Barefoot Sally, frizzy fiery hair and all, gone, gone from his aching arms. Nothing but white walls, white ceiling, white floor, and no door to be found anywhere.
“Sorry to bother you, Captain,” came a female computerized voice, “but we are nearing an asteroid field that will require your navigation.”
Ten years in space. Five years, six months and eleven days until he returned to Earth. Pete stood in the middle of the holodeck wondering what Barefoot Sally would look like today, why he had never stolen a kiss, why he never asked her to be his girl?
“Thank you Alice,” sighed Pete.
The hum of the deep space freighter vibrated under his bare feet."

She’s just completed her safely lecture and now she’s making her way through the cabin, ensuring everyone complies with her directives. I see people turning off their phones and other electronics as we prepare for takeoff. I just stare out the window at the tarmac, trying not to imagine the worst-case scenarios. It’s safer to fly than to drive, I remind myself.
Everyone has found their seats now, and the plane backs away from the terminal and taxis onto the runway. We wait a few minutes for our turn to takeoff, and then the plane wends its way onto the main runway. The jet engines rev up and the pilot releases the break. The plane accelerates as I am thrust back into my seat. I’ve already closed my eyes, and I’m thinking about my breathing. “Find your happy place,” I tell myself. Just another minute or two and I’ll be fine.
As the plane lifts off the runway and climbs rapidly, I realize that I’m now looking out the window at the landscape below. Everything gets farther and farther away as we climb. The skies are blanketed in thick clouds, so the landscape soon disappears. The windows stream with moisture as we speed through the clouds, and the plane shakes from turbulence in the atmosphere. But within a short time, we break through the clouds, climbing higher. Still looking out the window, I’m struck by the oddity of flying above the clouds. It looks like a sea of grayish cotton below us. This trip from Chicago to California is going to be remarkable.
After a while, I thumb through the Skymall catalog I find in the pocket seat in front of me. Who buys this stuff, anyway? It’s outrageously expensive, and mostly useless stuff. I soon get bored and wonder how to pass the time. The lady next to me is sleeping, so conversation is out--so is retrieving my book from the overhead bin where my bag is stored. There is no inflight movie for some reason. I close my eyes and decide to sleep a little.
Sometime later, how long I don’t know, I feel like someone is shining a flashlight in my eyes. Slowly I open my eyes and realize it’s the sun setting to the west. It’s beautiful! The whole sky is orange, and the sea of cotton clouds is burning now in deep oranges and reds. I wish I could take a picture! I’ve seen sunsets over oceans, over lakes, behind mountains and California redwoods. But this sunset is by far the most beautiful I’ve seen. Nothing constricts my view. It’s just the sun and the blanket of clouds. Since we’re traveling west, we follow the sunset, making it also the longest sunset I’ve ever seen.
Still, too soon the sun finds its way back to bed and the sky grows black. The rest of the flight is unmemorable. Eventually, we land at LAX. Again, I grip my armrests and close my eyes as the wheels touch down, but this time I quickly find my happy place. The jet engines roar in reverse as the plane decelerates, but I’m somewhere else. I’m sitting on a bed of fiery red cotton clouds watching the sun set the sky on fire."

Only the meat and half a slice of bread remained. Nadine held that morsel out in front of her.
“It’s all I have left but you are welcome to have it.”
The little dragon yipped and swirled in the water, its body staying just below the surface while its tiny little head and long preening neck danced above the surface, like a cormorant out for a swim. Nadine tossed the morsel, whole, into the air, just above its head. The cute little dragon burse forth out of the water, its jawn unhinging disproportionately wide, sharp needle-like teeth glistening in the morning sun, snatching the half sandwich whole out of the air, then torpedoed back under the water.
“Aw,” whined Nadine as the critter disappeared into the depths. It was so cute, Nadine wanted to play more.
It was Nadine’s turn to yip, not happily or begging, more shock and fear, when Wendy the Water Dragon burst out of the water, landing square in her lap. Nadine’s mouth fell agape. It took a moment to catch her breath, to catch her wits, but when she did, her hands could not resist petting those smooth slick scales. Narly instant, the little green dragon purred like a kitten, and so a friendship was born.
That was ten years ago. Nadine was only eight years old at the time. Now her life-long friend was hanging upside down atop a wharf in town. All because of some stupid girl who fell into the water, who was too stupid to learn how to swim, and intead of just sinking to the bottom of the lake, she splashed around frantically until Wendy, much bigger now, nearly twenty feet from head to tail, came along and scooped the stupid girl out of the water then laid her safely ashore.
The story spread quickly. Why they believed the stupid girl and never gave Nadine a second thought was beyond reason and just plain stupid, but believe her they did, and more stories morphed from there. From chickens and cattle stolen in the night, to fire-breathing mayhem of barn and house alike, even the snatching of little babies from their carriages when their mothers were not in sight. But Wendy had done none of that, she preferred deer and elk and the occasional moose, even rid the town dump of their bear problem over cold winter nights. She was gentle and kind, way fun to ride. Wendy could even humor Nadine with the occasional game of fetch. Clearly not the depraved evil monster these stories made her out to be.
And now she was gone, life snatched from her being, a friend snatched from Nadine. Another tear fell as Nadine dipped her big piggies into the cold empty waters."

We will succeed.
We can cross to the Isle at will now. We are working on translating all the runes and inscriptions carved into the surrounding stones. It is so beautiful! I can feel eternity, as well as oblivion, in this blessed and holy place. Soon, very soon…
We have had two workers pass through the gate! We eagerly await their return. So far, no one else can figure out how they did it. One of them was my own granddaughter! To think that one of my very own line was the first to rediscover how to get through the gate! Marvelous! The blood runs strong in her. At first I thought it would take several lifetimes, maybe even a couple of centuries to get this far. Look how close to our grasp. We will be a great people once more!
It’s been years and they have not found their way back. We still haven’t figured out how they got through as well. Some have grown worried about the project and want to stop working around the tomb and gate. I overrode them. We will not rest until we relearn all its secrets.
We have come to the conclusion that we must negate all the wards inscribed in the stone to open the gate. These wards are all that’s holding the stone together, however. We must find a way to reinforce the stone, while still maintaining its proper alignments. This will take some time to figure out properly. We will do this. We are so close. The end is in sight. We will succeed.
This is the day. The DAY! We are going to open the gate. We will once again travel the paths our ancestors walked! We will bring back our ancient civilization. We will be great again. Our people will be able to work great wonders, master all fields of knowledge, have the power to do many things that we only thought was fairy tales passed down through the generations.
Noooo...It’s too late. What have we done? What have I done? Why did I push so hard to do this? How can I undo the undoable? We opened the gate and a god came through. It is a monster that devours our flesh and soul. How could we be so naive? So ignorant? Who would have thought the portal was sealed to protect us? And we reopened it to our doom.
All we can do is worship it and hope that our prayers will get through to it and change it.
Until then, we serve, we obey, we die. Soon it will be too much for our world to handle. The ground is already dying. No bit of life escapes its maw.
It hears my thoughts. I can’t keep it out of my head. Now it comes for me.
I don’t have much time. Please forgive me for what I have caused. Hopefully you or those who come after you will find a way.

I’ve found my worth, my hope, in prion. Within two months of landing in New Jersey State Prison, what they call “The Last Stop” (because more than 70% of the population will never be released), I got my high school diploma, was nominated valedictorian of my graduating class, and became a Teacher’s Aid, all at 20 years old.
That allowed me to incorporate education, along with my writing, as my sanctuary. I have never felt better and I’ve taken pretty much all of the programs NJDOC offers: Focus on the Victim, SEALL (Successful Employment And Lawful Living), Cage Your Rage, Thinking 4 A Change, Workforce Learning Link, Stock Market Game Worldwide (4 times), and several correspondence courses from Criminon New York (The Way to Happiness, Conditions of Life, Personal Integrity), American Bible Academy, Set-Free Prison Ministries (15 of them), EMMAUS (15 of them), and others.
But, it wasn’t until I encountered Helen and Maureen of Houses of Healing. I don’t know if you have this course at your prison- but take it! I truly love this course, and I genuinely love Helen and Maureen for what they’ve shown me. They don’t see the superficial you, they see the Core You! It’s beautiful. After that, I found College Guild (www.collegeguild.org) and it is amazing. I’ve taken their creative language course and Poetry Club 1 and 2, I’m working on Poetry Club 3, too. Their staff is incredible: Julie, Beth, Bekah and all the others. I owe them so much.
These were all my shields against my fog returning and being able to endure the systematic dehumanization that being in prison succumbs you to. Unlike dear Catherine LaFleur, we have no nature here. In Southwoods State Prison, you don’t even have the chance to step in grass. It’s a void that hurts a person like me who loves nature.
Even with that, I feel no loneliness. I have the company of angels- all of you. Sure, we do not speak face to face, but you know me, I can know you… the true you… the true me. We spend time every time we write and read. Now, I am participating in the Build a Book Program. Wow, I truly appreciate that program, and Maia for sharing her expertise. Also, thank you Jennifer for being another reader of my poetry. Thank you all- every single one of you! Fog… gone."

Pouring out my heavy heart because it’s too filled
And yet still, the love increases
Allow me to share the time my heart shattered to pieces.
My family shunned me, said I was the cause of Grandma’s death
My incarceration brought on too much stress, made her depressed
She went to lay down to rest, but never woke up.
Heard the news, got choked up. My heart broke up.
I beat myself in the head, like an egg my mind yolked up and scrambled.
I hate this part, can someone please change this channel
It’s more than I can handle.
I descend to my knees, desperately with a desperate need
I retrieve the scarlet shards of my heart, I’m desperate, please!
Hoping if I could put pieces back together
But each prick hurts worse than before
Like white hot pins pierced through each of my pores.
I suffer with every movement.
And I know I have to be strong enough.
I try to reach out to my family, but I guess my arm isn’t long enough.
I can’t blame how they feel.
I never intended to unintentionally kill.
The first woman we ever loved.
The last woman I ever hugged.
Grandma taught us to be kind and do right.
But I went down the wrong path on this cruel hike.
She disapproved, but still provided provisions
And now she’s no longer here due to my foolish decisions.
Tell me, why didn’t I listen.
Abandoned as a baby, starving and naked
In an empty, frigid apartment that was supposed to be vacant.
I only survived because a neighbor had heard my high pitched cry.
Grandma took me in and provided supplies, like food and pampers
But I wasn’t around when she got sick with cancer.
No matter what I do, I could never repay this debt.
I have to begin somehow, so I take baby steps.
I miss talking to my brothers, I love them till death!
But if that’s the price of my love, than I suppose hating me is best.
Six, five, four seconds left of Grandma’s last phone call
Now we are down to two.
She rushes to say “stay safe and I love you”
Before I had a chance to open my mouth, the phone cut out.
I don’t know if you can hear me now, but I hope you do
I just wanna say, I miss you grandma, and I love you too."

She never faltered in her faith, never compromised her beliefs, never blamed any of life’s hardships on God; she just gave more love and caring to those around her. She worked hard at the same company for over thirty years, even though they refused to pay her fairly or recognize her dedication. She believed in keeping your word and being loyal even to those who didn’t deserve it.
She raised her grandson with the same beliefs and philosophy on life as she had lived on. She gave him her heart, wisdom, security, and all the love and understanding one could ask for. Yet, he was hard headed, thought he knew it all in this youth, and wouldn’t listen to reason. He broke that lady’s heart more than can be counted on both hands and feet. He was constantly in and out of jail, in trouble of every kind, in and out of relationships. He couldn’t keep a job, a place to live, or even clothes on his back at times. But Daisy never gave up on him, and never faltered in her love, understanding, or caring. She prayed for him constantly.
In 2007 while the grandson was finishing a short prison sentence in a Georgia prison, his father died of cancer in a Tennessee prison. When the grandson was released later that year, nothing had changed for him. He was still bent on destroying his life. In 2008 that beautiful lady lost her life to a stroke, but all the years of worry and stress over her son and grandson were the real killers.
I still carry a heavy burden over that. I am the grandson. But, that same kid that came to this prison system has finally started to put all of that wisdom and advice she shared to use and has started to become the man that she always thought he could be.
For many years I mourned her loss, these days I celebrate her life. I love you Daisy, the most beautiful flower of my life.

Neither blamed the other. God, I just needed them back quicker than expected. The two babies only lived a few hours but stayed forever in our lives. I remembered as a kid, the entire family (now 5 kids) and our folks would walk the ten minutes or so to the cemetery and visit the twins. The trauma of the loss turned mama’s hair white overnight, but she was stronger than any of us gave her credit for.
Neither were ever unfaithful to the other. It was not even considered. They did not not smoke or do drugs. I had never seen my dad drunk. Mama, maybe tipsy once! A few beers once in a while were their vice and when I say once in a while, think 3 times a year-- 4 if you count New Years.
They were both satisfied with just enjoying life, family, and a quiet abundance of peace and joy within their souls. When it was dad’s time to start the next step of his journey, he passed peacefully in mama’s arms.
We all thought she would be lost without him and would soon follow but as I speak of the huge strength that she possessed, mama stayed in this world for another 13 years. She still had many more lives to brighten, whether they were family or strangers she would meet and never see but once.
She would use to say: ”If I was a better mother, you would not have done this to go to prison”
All I can say is this: If I would just listen to the wisdom and the advice of these two marvelously kind and loving people, my path would have gone another way. It was neither their fault that I made a bad choice. I have, for the past 16 years or so, tried to turn my life around to be just half the person they were. I know they are smiling down at me, proud of the person I have become.
For this gift called life,
I thank you Mom and Dad.
I’ll make the most of it."

Deadbeat dads always pissed me off. They had these wonderful children that looked up to and relied upon them, and they ran from that. All a kid really wants is a mommy and dad who loves them. They didn't ask to be brought into the world. Now their dad is too busy to spend time with them. He complains because they need money. A kid can’t get a job and support themselves.
You’d think a man who created an innocent child would want to give money to the little person who carries their last name. You’d think they’d want to guide those little people in life so they can grow up to be good big people. But way too many in our world today look down at those babies they created and see nuisance.
When they hear them cry, they only think of the noise. They don’t stop to consider that maybe the baby just wants to be held by their daddy. They run away from their responsibilities.
Those dads ignore the children they brought into the world and complain because the government garnishes their wages. While men like me would die to have a child who calls them daddy. It would be a dream come true. The government wouldn’t have to take my money because I would love to give every penny I have to make sure my child has everything they need.
I never thought I’d get to experience being a daddy after trying for so long to have a child of my own with no success until I met Barbara. Even then, I didn’t get to have children the typical way. They technically weren’t my daughters. But you wouldn’t be able to tell them that. No, to them, I am daddy Jay.
I cherished every single second I got to be a dad. If you want to know what I’m thankful for, it’s pushing two little girls on a swing set. It’s talking to the baby through Barbara’s belly when she was still pregnant with her. It’s laying between them on the living room floor reading the “Wizard of Oz.” I’m thankful for every smile we ever got to share. I thank God I got to be daddy Jay.
I may only be their stepdad and I might not ever get to see them again since Barbara and I aren’t together anymore. She left me when I came to prison. But when they started calling me daddy Jay and I told them that it was okay; it’s a responsibility i accepted for the rest of my life.
If they ever need anything, I’ll be there. I’m going to put money in three separate accounts for them for college, even if I’m not allowed to see them anymore because their mother moved on. Then, when they are older, they will know daddy Jay always loved them like they were really my daughters. I’m thankful for every single memory I got to make with my little family. I’ll always be daddy Jay and those baby girls and their mother will always be the reason my dreams came true."

After walking around the house to ensure all of the storm windows were properly closed, Jannie went into the spartan living room. Devoid of the most common of furniture and family photos, the only exception to amenities was where she found Jared, sitting in his over-stuffed recliner. Despite the plentiful space, an aging TV with a very modern satellite attachment which afforded them 200 premium channels from around the world sat in front of him, nearly touching his knees.
Jared sat motionless with the TV remote in his outstretched hand, pointed at the news channel that repeatedly showed a short, amateur video of wild geese flying in a perfect circle across the screen.
“Well, would you look at that,” he said.
“What’d reckon it means?” she asked.
“Dear, it could be a sign of the times.” He turned to look at her. “We knew it would come without warning.”
“Come on then, husband. Let’s go downstairs.” She kicked off her shoes and began to move toward the kitchen. He followed close behind, just in time to see her easily slide the kitchen table into the corner. Underneath was a small hole with a latch that she depressed. It popped back up, and she pulled it to her. The square door opened quietly on hidden hinges. She stood back.
“You first, husband. I will seal it behind us.”
He moved over to the door that had covered a stairwell leading down into the darkness. WIth familiarity and the dexterity of a much younger man, Jared climbed down. She followed close behind, sealing the door.
When she was halfway down, bright lights flickered on, but she expected them and didn’t so much as pause in her descent 20 feet below. When her bare foot touched down on the cold metal floor, there was no sound. She looked around at the monitors, control panels and multi-colored switches that covered 3 walls. Jared was turning on the panel in front of him. He turned to her with a look of excitement and began to undress. He hastily stripped his clothes off while his loose, weathered skin simultaneously began to draw tight. The wisp of white hair on his head came off with a swipe of his hand as easily as wiping off water. With his clothes off, he stood in front of her, his arms up as if putting himself on display. His skin was smooth, tight, and ashen grey, and he had no visible genitalia. His head, much larger than it should have been for his body size, was set above two large, slanted, ebony orbs.
“I like this look much better,” she said, having removed her clothing as well. SHe appeared just as he did, with no distinguishing features to tell them apart, except the ice blue contact lenses that she was removing.
After Jared sat and stared at the console, he began moving levers and typing; his arthritic hands were gone and replaced with three thick fingers that moved swiftly over the keyboard. “I’ll let them know we are ready for contact.”"

Especially those of them that are children because they are still forming and due to this, much more susceptible to disease. And now that vaccinations aren’t working--due to them using eggs as their base and not plankton--its growth within them is more rapid.
On top of all of this, they are smoking. Destroying their feeble, still forming lungs. All the while knowing the end result of it. I myself did it. Even after watching my own grandmother suffer and die from emphysema. And, they have access to similar knowledge. But even more so, they have access to nicotine.
E-cigarettes are the worst possible things that could be allowed at markets. This becomes even more true if it is unregulated. Not only by making liquid cancerous substances easier to acquire, but due to the fact it will make other drugs easier to hide. Do you actually believe that a kid cannot come up with a way to make a cocktail to smoke? If a politician can legalize THC oil, you best believe a teenager can manufacture it.
In Texas this year, marijuana oil was legalized for children’s use. Now you take that, put it in your E-cigarette, and get high with all of your kids. Oh, and just mix it with incense and liquid tobacco, and you can use it anywhere. And if that’s not potent enough for you, add a little sherm. That’s right. Zooda-bang that mix. Hey, for the club, liquify some Molly or speed, or heroin and H-base ecstasy. Be sure to chase it with an energy drink though. We need to be sure we’re hospitalized at the end of the day.
Hospitals and comeback medications are the number one and two leading industries in our entire world. This has been true year after year, especially during the Recession. For this reason, the powers that be will never outlaw cancer-causing substances. Just like they’ll never find a true cure for anything anymore. I mean, look at the product Belsomra. All it does is help you get a good night sleep. But it can give you suicidal tendencies. Do you really need a night’s sleep so bad that you’ll risk waking up in the morning to kill yourself? Even still, killing ourselves in groups is exactly what our so-called betters want. Only, the governments want to tax these deaths, and corporations want us to pay them outright for it. Do you believe it? You should. Because you can get wind of it from all of their back alley deals. Foreigners own us; they always have. Just ask Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If not, take me at my word now, and you might live to see it manifest because your eyes. It’s either that, or to submit to the will of those that are no longer allowed to love.
Your children are your very own. It’s a very simple and innate principle that you should want what’s best for them. But even you can’t, with all your heart, soul and might, save them from the circumstances of the day. You can, however, teach them the best you can. And also, check every single label very carefully. Even calling the company or FDA if you have to. This will show your kids and their friends you care. It will make it far more than just a conservation in passing moments. Don’t do it. And your child will be the next one going out to smoke a few with a couple of his friends."

I chose and was selected to attend U.S. Navy Hospital Corps school after boot camp.
Motivated by the life waiting back home for me should I fail the academics and demands of Corps school, I did amazingly well. Graduating first in my class, I was offered the chance to attend an advanced school of Aviation Medicine. This would likely further my chances of being sent to San Diego.
The sun was indeed shining on me the day I received my orders to report as the new Corpsman for VF-111, an F-14 Tomcat squadron based in Miramar, just North of San Diego, California. I mean, San Diego, a fighter squadron based two hangers down from the world famous Top Gun school? To quote Eric Cartman . . . . . “Sweeeet!”
My 3 years with VF-111 were at the same time difficult and amazing. Difficult being away from home for as much as 6 months at a time, but amazing to see the world as I did.
Back in San Diego, I met the people who were also Corpsmen that trained Pilots and aircrew in Aviation Physiology and Water Survival. These were a very select bunch and there were only so many centers of training in the fleet. I applied for, was accepted to, and graduated from my next school as an Aviation Physiology Tech and Water Survival Instructor. I was then sent to Naval Air Station, Barber’s Point, Hawaii, to begin what I imagined to be the next phase of a long Naval career. Prior to leaving VF-111 in San Diego, I was decorated with a Navy Achievement Medal and promoted in rank for my performance there. In my eyes, the future in the Navy looked very bright to me and I had no reason to look elsewhere.
My life in Hawaii was nothing short of ideal. We lived in a large house, one mile from Ewa Beach, there was an abandoned World War II airfield near my house where my dog could run off leash and free, and my job duties included teaching water survival at the outdoor base swimming pool. The group of people I worked with were close and our families spent weekends at cookouts or camping right on the beach.
The physical demands of being an instructor in this field were well above many other sailors in the fleet. Therefore, a substantial part of our day was spent working out to maintain our physical readiness. My day typically started at 5:30 a.m. in the gym and also included an hour run or swim at lunch time. As you might imagine, we were in good shape. We had to be, given that our facility trained not only Naval Aviation personnel, but all the other special forces from all branches on the Islands. This included Army Rangers, Green Berets, Navy EOD (Bomb Squad), and even some Navy Seals.
The other side of our department’s training included the annual training of service members in the altitude chamber. The chamber simulated the conditions at high altitude and reinforced to all aircrew the dangers of hypoxia. Hypoxia simply refers to low oxygen levels in the bloodstream. At altitudes above 8,000 feet, oxygen was typically used via a mask by all aircrew. If a malfunction in the system that delivers the oxygen were to occur at altitude, anything from confusion to unconsciousness to even death could occur in mere minutes if they did not recognize the signs of O2 deprivation.
The altitude chamber itself was a danger, as there was a small chance to suffer “the bends.” Similar to diving underwater, when the atmospheric pressure on our bodies changes, nitrogen gas comes out of solution and can and does circulate in our bloodstream. With normal, controlled ascents and descents in diving or flying, nitrogen typically returns to its harmless state. In some cases, however, it can lodge anywhere in the bloodstream and can cause anything from excruciating pain or even death if the obstruction occurs in the brain. For this reason, our center required that one or more of our staff be certified as a Navy Diver. In case of an emergency, that person would accompany the victim to the University of Hawaii’s dive chamber to treat them.
One of the divers at our center was due to rotate out and so we had to select someone to attend Navy Scuba School to take his place. I eagerly raised my hand.
Navy Scuba School is no joke. I was told to expect rigorous physical training that would challenge even the most fit individual. So with a couple months to go, I decided to increase my already strenuous regimen. That decision would prove to be the end of my Naval career, but the start of one even more challenging and fulfilling than I could ever have imagined.
The very next morning in the gym found my working out with the other Navy Diver in my command. I trusted him to coach me through what I needed to do to prepare me. We began the morning with some lunges. A common lower body exercise, nothing too hard or me and I thought nothing of it until the next day.
The following morning, I woke up with what literally was a pain in the butt. It wasn’t horrible then, but later in the day as I got out of the chair, it was as if somebody had stabbed me there. I made quite a scene in the office as I hobbled around like a man 50 years my senior. I thought nothing of it for about 2 or 3 days even though it didn’t subside and, if anything, seemed to intensify. Finally, I went to the base clinic where one of the doctors diagnosed me with a strained gluteal muscle . . . . . in English, I pulled a butt muscle. At this point in my medical career,  I knew some things, but not enough to understand what this was that had happened to me and now threatened my goals to finish dive school.
Daily life wasn’t too awful. As long as I was on my feet or upright and moving I was fine. However, the minute I sat in a chair or a car, or tried to get up from bed, the pain was incapacitating. By that time 3 months later, 2 other Navy Doctors had seen me, diagnosed a gluteal strain, placed me on light duty and there I sat, or tried to. I missed out on dive school and because of my injury, was taken off of flight status. In a matter of months, I went from top physical condition to riding a desk.
The initial injury was in October. By February, 5 months later, the pain was now in my left leg and foot. I could not sleep in a bed and most nights walked the floors until I was so exhausted, I could actually get 10 minutes of sleep. Not on a bed, mind you, a hard tile floor.
Finally, 5 months later, miserable and at my wit’s end, I was given an answer to my problem. Unable to move one Saturday, with no Navy Doctors available, I went to see a local civilian chiropractor. After a mere 5 minutes, he told me I most certainly had a herniated disc in my spine pressing on a nerve that runs down my left side. I now was developing some mild weakness in my foot. That, coupled with the failure of several doctor visits and ER visits to diagnose the issue over the last 5 months, prompted the chiropractor to insist I see a surgeon ASAP.
One week later, I’m in the neurosurgeon’s office. The next day, an MRI of my spine is done, which showed a huge herniated disc which was indeed pressing on a nerve that controls part of my left leg and foot. The next week, I underwent surgery to address the issue. Surgery went well and I woke up with a numb foot but no leg pain for the first time in 6 months. I was very pleased.
I was sent home to recover. Off work entirely for 4 weeks, then back to desk work for a while. I was eventually able to do some swimming again despite some fairly persistent leg pain. Overall, the surgery helped the worst of the discomfort but not all.
18 months after the surgery despite PT medications, 2 more MRIs and no return to full duty, I was diagnosed with Battered Nerve Root syndrome. The severity and duration of my condition resulted in an improvement but an incomplete ability to recover.
During my year and a half of recovery, I met a Navy Physician  Assistant. He talked to me at length about the career and I was excited and hopeful to pursue it. I took as many college courses as I could at night and on the weekends until I finally separated from the Navy in 1994.
I returned home to Minneapolis and enrolled in a Pre-Med type course designed to fulfill the requirements for application to their PA Program. The work ethics I learned in the Navy served me well. I had become a very capable student, finally determined to apply myself to the coursework.
I was accepted to the PA Program in 1995 and graduated with honors in 1998. Despite my current situation, I am proud and thankful for my 26 years in medicine. These were, at the same time, the most difficult and most enjoyable of my life.
The prompt for this journal project is The Blink of an Eye. I believe my blink occurred in that Hawaiian gym, early one October morning with a barbell of weights on my shoulder. All of that led to what I’ve just described. None of which would have happened without the lunge."

I really like the old saying that has been around longer than myself. When you feel that life is moving too fast, “you have to stop and smell the roses.” Not everyone will stop and do that in life. Food for thought. Remember flowers are living, breathing plants. They brighten up our prison as well as brighten up a person’s eyes. Share a smile, share a flower.

A time when young boys could explore nature close up, where you felt safe and at peace
We frequently camped overnight. It was too great to be in nature at night. When you reached the river’s edge, you could see downtown Sacramento. With light a plenty, and lange paddle wheel boats cruising the river. Each year old replica ships sailed up to the area, and anchored on our Side of the river to avoid intruders. But we could just wade night up to these old time sail ships and climb aboard as we knew the crews.
These crews came from all over. Each year, another strange, exotic lizard or kind of make would get free and join our nature’s zoo. We had lizards from the South Pacific which run on two legs with that giant skin collar, flared over. I forget their name but definitely not from America.
My zoo had wild born, as well as aligarh not seen anywhere else. Other than a zoo in California.
Hey, admission is free but be ready to pitch in to clean trails and pick up litter. This was at Broderick zoo, a pool child's delight.
We are still very proud of our little nature zoo. Now old Broderick is gang riddled. Poverty and drugs around. Yet even today, our private trails are clean, safe, and the nature area is the same. That is because many of my schoolmates never left. As now they take their children, grandchildren too to see our Broderick Zoo.
You can never locate these places, as the last way to maintain our childhood wonder was to keep secret where it exists.
A small warning to outsiders to. You don't want to go exploring to locate my tale’s local. As Broderick oes keep somethings just how God meant them to be timeless today as it was back when I was a child too!
How about you? Do you have a childhood memory of that special place? We all do. At least I hope that’s true."

A lion knows who they are, where they are going and they fear nothing. No one can herd a lion.
When a lion roars people stop and listen, knowing he roars with a purpose. Josh I can’t help it, I’m a lion and one day this world will hear me roar little brother, and you will be right there with me.”
With the unfavorable circumstances Caleb and his little brother Josh must endure, most people would say that Caleb’s dream of rising above will never happen. Maybe it looks that way, but not to Caleb. For him there is only one way he can go, and that’s up.
Caleb and Josh know loneliness. Having no more than each other they search the streets and allies for a place to belong, but they find nothing that can hold Caleb’s ideal of the life he will one day have. He will not settle for anything less. Caleb must one day roar.
Caleb can not relate with others that define who they are based on whether they have lots of money or how much they own, or some title they received.
A lion is a lion. Nothing can be added to or taken away that could cause a lion not to be a lion. They need nothing and by doing so have everything.
Caleb and Josh do not know how it is to lose everything they own or have who they are take away when all is lost. For that to happen to them, they must first have something to lose. They have no family, no mother to comfort them, to hold them tight during these long dark nights. No father to protect them, to show them how to walk the path that has no light. To lift them up when they trip and fall over the labels set before them by others. To uncover the seed of doubt that lurks in the dark place, less it take root in their hearts and choke on the faith needed to lift their lives out of the clutches of defeat into the light where they will learn to roar.
How will these two kids break free from the chains they were born with clamped tight around their lives? They will embrace them for what they are.
These chains are the only gift their parents left to them. Their parents were born with the same chains. However, Caleb and Josh, unlike their parents, see their chains not as a device to hold them down, chained to a life of suffering, but as a gift binding them together, giving them a constant reminder that nothing can ever pull them apart. That no matter where life will take them, they will be there together. With their hearts and minds chained together, Caleb and Josh will take that which was meant to oppress them, the very tool designed to destroy any chance of having a life, a chance to rise above their circumstances and soar.
Standing tall, they look at fate straight in the face, and smile, removing the dark veils that covered their faces. The dense coverings that made their faces invisible to the world around them. The eyeless mask that kept them out of sight, out of mind, to the world around them. A world where those that have it all, also have so much to lose.
Caleb and Josh discovered a secret. How it’s not a misfortune not to have many possessions if they are not used to define who you are, or cause you to suffer if they are taken from you. They are a wonderful gift.
To them the most wonderful, most valuable possession they have, or could ever want is their unconditional love for one another. The comfort in knowing that no matter how high they one day rise in this world and even if everything they accomplish is taken away, the chains of love will still bind them together. Knowing that when you start with nothing, you end up with everything.
Josh, I promise you will look back on this day. The day when we have nothing but each other and are thankful. For what could not hold us down made us stronger. String enough that we could rise up and roar. We are our brother's keeper."

I explained my plans for Grandma and Grandpa and he’s been to the campground so he knew how to get there.
Curious where I was, I told him. He said he was nearby at a small party and told me to come by. What the hell. It's been a long time since I've seen him, so I put the address in my GPS and drove over. Turns out he was about 15 miles away.
What a wild night that was. At about midnight we heard sirens and went out front to investigate. The sight In front of us was absurd.
A man presumably intoxicated was on a riding lawn mower driving down a country road with a long gun laying across his lap, followed by a painfully slow procession of brightly lit squad cars following like a mother duck chicks.
That was enough for me. I was 18 and shouldn't have been drinking, so I hit the road seeing all the cops were going in the opposite direction with the redneck hot wheels. I was blasted!
On the way to the wayside, I drunkenly fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the center line In front of a very attentive trucker who blasted his air horn waking me up. I pulled over turned the CB on apologized to the trucker and also thanked him.
True fact-most accidents happen close to the intended destination. Mine was no different. My blood pressure never should have been as high as it was that night. In my truck I rolled down the window, took a couple deep breaths, lit a smoke and drove to the wayside parking lot. It took me forever to calm down. Scared the hell out of me. Talk about a close call. I will never drink and drive again.
The best part was having that anniversary brunch with my beloved grandparents. If only they knew how close the brunch came to not happening, when they had no idea It was gonna happen. I was incarcerated soon after."

Soon, all will have forgotten of your very existence.” The Man began frantically trying every method to escape he could conceive to no avail. He then sank to his knees and told the World, “Alas, you are harder than I could have imagined.

Going exploring and playing in the hay barn or whatever.    We didn’t have much use for a sister. We weren’t included in her stuff so, return the favor.
It turns out sisters are helpful in one good way. They help a man relate to daughters in future life.
Family troubles occurred when she was nine. My family was split apart and my sister was adopted away from us boys. A doctor and his family thought my sister was special enough to call theirs. It took seventeen years to see her again. Mindy came to Texas to visit and reunite with us, her brothers.
I learned she had moved with her new family to the north and become a Yankee. Ain’t that special! Hearing a Rhode Island accent come from my sister’s mouth was hilarious to me.
My sister had followed our family tradition and served an enlistment in the United States Armed Forces. She chose the Navy. There are so many jokes available there.
I discovered my sister had three tattoos and their meaning to her. Awesome! Tattooed chicks are cool! After seventeen years, it’s more of a cool friend than a sister.
I took my sister out honky tonkin’. Mam! She was a spectacle on the dance floor. Red silk shirt and black slacks in heels. I’m prejudiced, but she was absolutely beautiful too. I’m pretty sure they figured her out for an out-of-state. They wouldn’t have believed she started out Texan. That evening was special. I’d pay good money to know the conversations she had back home.
We were sitting around talking and a female country singer named Mindy came on the radio. I told my sister all these years each time I heard that singer I thought of her. Mindy told me, night back, all these years, she wondered if when I heard that singer, I thought of her because of the name Mindy? Great minds think alike.
After she returned home, I used her tattoos as inspiration for a couple of nice poems I did for her. I sent them to her to let her know I still think of her and she’s special to me. I'm thankful I have a sister. Mindy is special to me."

One weekend, she was hanging out with me and some other friends at my house. A couple of weeks later, I got the tragic news, she’d overdosed on heroin. I didn't even know she did heroin. A few days before she overdosed, she’d called me and said she needed a place to stay, but because I was trying to work things out with my girlfriend at the time and knew it would cause problems, I told her I couldn’t help her. When I think back on all of it now, would she still be alive if I’d have given her a place to rest her head? I’ll never know, but that is probably the part that hurts the worst. Never knowing causes guilt. I wept at her funeral. I thought whatever she was going through, everything would be okay but it wasn’t. In the blink of an eye, heroin took a wonderful person from the world and changed the lives of everyone she knew.
One of my best friends, Josh Duran, and I got into a dumb argument over a female. It seems so stupid and insignificant as I think back on it now. A while after this happened, a mutual friend told me she’d talked to him and he’d told her I was mad at him, so he was obviously pretty bothered by it. Being the hard headed guy I often seem to be, knew we’d eventually talk about it and be friends like we’d always been. I ended up in prison. Then my granny told me about the car wreck that had taken his life. I got the clipping from the newspaper in the main, but we never were able to apologize. One of the best friends I ever had went to his final resting place with us not on speaking terms. I thought there would be plenty of time but in the blink of an eye all his time was taken away. I had to tell him I was sorry through a prayer. I can only hope and believe he received that prayer, I believe God shared it with him up there.
Life happens so fast as it is. Today, we is all we have; right now we are here but what about tomorrow? How hard would it be to apologize to someone you care about and swallow your pride? How hard is it to help someone in need? I promise you it is easier than it will be if you blink your eyes only to open them and be robbed of the chance of being able to do so in the future, because they are gone. Sometimes it really hurts to blink your eyes, so if you have a chance to lessen that pain, do it, before it is too late."

It’s exactly why cherry bombs and children never mix well. The little child had the split too close to his face. He lost an eye and a couple fingers for good measure. I was the one who had to do first aid to the child, deal with screaming Joker whom I kicked the living crap out of, several times that day and the following year. It was the parents I had the hardest time with. Dad wanting to kill, literally, the joker. Mom who could not hold it together for the sake of the baby boy who was maimed. I was 14 almost 15 and very much an adult by now, due to the life I was raised in.
I hate practical jokes. I have never cared for them and had no use for them. Now I won’t tolerate them in good humor. Practical jokes can kill. Grow up, America: humor and fun are fine. But pulling jokes on another is never okay. As I write this, Sunday 15th of November 2015, France is mourning. The world is mourning. Babies are dying in the sea when parents flew war so the child can live as an adult.
Do we really need a word prompt titled “practical jokes”? Not in this world. What we need in more thoughts about empathy, tolerance, united, one world-one people, parole day, hope for the future… Think of this: You are asking us inmates to express ourselves and upload emotions hidden far too long.

My britches were mudstained at the knees, my face streaked with dirt, as I would proudly hand her the bouquet of ill-gotten flowers. If I hadn’t been so darn cute I think I would have gotten scolded for the misdeed!
As a young adult I used flowers to get myself out of the “dog house” with my significant other, or buy her flowers for no apparent reason which usually led to a little gratuity in the form of “nooky.” Thanks flowers!
When I entered the world of the penal system there were no more flowers, no more bees. No more butterflies. The “yard” was covered in sparse grass and gopher holes. My relationship with flowers had withered away as I feared my soul would too someday. In 1998, I was transferred to Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, CA. Don’t let the name fool you, there weren’t many pleasantries issued out there. However, I managed to procure a job on the yard-crew and my designated area was a large swath of grass- 10 feet wide by 200 feet long. Inside that area I began planting flowers, bushes, herbs, and some dwarf trees. In a few years time my flower beds were thriving. Suddenly, the bees and butterflies returned. But I no longer tried to catch the butterflies nor did I harass the bees. I simply relaxed and admired these small insects doing what nature intended for them to do. I had grown over sixty rose bushes. I also had planted daisies, petunias, goldenrod, and philodendron. The herbs consisted of thyme, cilantro, and rosemary. I enjoyed my job immensely. Finally I had slowed down. I no longer rushed through life, missing all that there was to see, all that there was to hear, and all that there was to smell. This flower garden was an oasis in the middle of hot concrete walkways and buildings. A place to admire instead of fear. Seven years later I was transferred to Valley State Prison in Chowchilla.
Valley State (also known as VSP) was once a women’s prison, but was now occupied by men. I noticed on my first day that there weren’t any flowers. The following day I went to the back main yard to go to the chapel and that’s when I first saw it. My initial reaction reminded me of all those years ago when my father would drive us to see the California poppies. We’d be driving off road over little rolling hills and as we began to descend we could see the poppies stretch out for as far as the eye could see. That initial view was breathtaking. And so it was when I rounded the corner of the gym and saw the chapel lawn area for the first time. The landscaping was immaculate. Large, lush flower beds encircled a wide grassy area. On one end of the lawn was a waterfall. At the other end, (the entrance), was a stone archway. Large, decorative stones with plaques declaring donors' names adorned a side of the flower beds. This is where I spent my Sundays from 11:00 to 4:00 during our Buddhist services. The flower, the bees, and the butterflies had returned.
I spent three years there until I was once again transferred to my current locale: California Institute for Men in Chino, CA. This is a dorm setting with four dorms on each side of the yard. In between the dorms are “mini-yards,” and they are all well maintained with flower beds and vegetation. So for now my life is once again in the company of flowers and bees and butterflies.
Side note: I have not written the Prisoner Express for over two years. I have immersed myself in college and self-help. However, thanks to a couple of women whom I shall gratefully call my “muses,” I have been motivated to once again share my view of life with you all. The first shout-out goes to fellow writer Catherine LaFleur. Your mention of my story “The Healing Power of Toys” warmed my heart. Isn’t that why we write in the first place? To touch others? Thank you. And to let you know, you are truly my favorite author. I almost feel as if I know you. My second shout-out goes to a woman whom I am absolutely crazy about. Alas this relationship is forbidden fruit but hopefully I can someday melt her reserves and we can remain friends. She inspires my mind, challenges my intellect, warms my heart, and fills me with hope. Thank you."

Well it won’t be easy, I also have claws to cut up your face
To win, to be the victor, you got to stay on your feet
For me, that’s easy, I got 4, so if you slip, you’re fresh meat
Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just be friends
You could pet me, we could hunt together, two old enemies making amends
You came to feed your ego, make a trophy out of me
I came to feed my family, I see you, do you see me?

Kid was out of ammunition and the bad guys were on the move. Our less than hygienical hero started stealing the Queen of Diamond’s diamonds from right off her plump fingers. There were 4 whelped up bad guys. After the dead eye dick with a wrist rocket began propelling diamonds there were 4 dead bad guys strewn about the carriage with holes in their throat.
The homeless urchin found himself full of acclaim and applause for rescuing the queen from certain death. All the queen’s diamonds were recovered except one. The diamonds were dug from the cadavers of evil men getting their just reward. However, the one unrecovered was the most important, the kingdom’s heirloom. Whoever held this diamond was controller, autocrat, king, queen, sole ruler of a nation.
Of course this shady urchin stole the diamond. To him it was nothing but a big shiny rock. A certain queen wanted her right to reign back, and would stop at nothing to get her just. It was all planned out in a meticulous manner. Urchin was pretty much kidnapped, groomed to the extreme, run through the body scanners time and again, and about to be tortured. The good queen quavered at this excessive display, and thought to persuade the child to reveal the whereabouts of the kingdom’s diamond.
There was a knock on the queen’s chamber and her majordomo entered, as grumpy as ever. Telling the queen her guest had arrived.
“Your majesty, to beseech thee to permit your servant to lop the boy’s head off” pleaded the Majordomo. She looked nonplussed at this statement. She was never one for violence, to the complete aggravation of her officers.
“Oooo Tippleworth you have my diamond?”
“Not as yet your highness.”
“Idiot, why do you want to execute my little savior then?” The good queen huffed. “Go get the child and bring him in please.” Tippleworth bowed, and clicked back towards the foyer closet and found the urchin- remarkably- where he left him. The kid had shown an amazing aptitude to disobey even the smallest order.
“Boy, the queen wishes to see you, and I admonish you to be on your best behavior. In fact, it may be best for you to place your hands in your pocket,” Tippleworth patiently explained.
“Well what about my flowers I picked ‘em special for her,” our hero whined.
“You scapulous curr, you picked those flowers right out of the royal flower beds, oh, alright, carry them yourself.”
“Thank you sir,” and off the urchin and Majordomo went.
Upon entering the Queen’s private chambers the urchin did not stop or bow, but walked right up to the Queen of Diamonds and thrusted the flowers at her.
“Well, what have we here?” The Queen beamed, pretending not to notice where the flowers came from.
“You saved my life and all gratitude is warranted, but you have something that belongs to me, you took it right off the royal finger! Now hand it over please, sir.” The hard look in the usually benevolent eyes of the queen made the urchin realize that he was in the presence of a queen indeed.
With bowed heads, the raggamuffins quivered: “The diamond is in the flowers, your majesty, right in the middle of ‘em.” The queen looked and it was there glowing as she had never seen it glow. Mesmerized and transfixed, the queen had a vision, and knew she must marry her daughter to this street urchin before her. Her grandson would begin the 1000 year reign."

We don’t try and make him who we want him to be. The flying creatures with wings work diligently for him day after day. Forever spreading seeds of new beginnings all over the world. They never complain about their work, for they understand their very purpose for being. They never worry for the things they need, their food, their clothing, their shelter. The creator provides all.
We all watched the two-legged creatures begin to perish. It started thousands of years ago when they began to covet one another’s possessions. Never satisfied, never content with what they had. The deep desire for more began to grow. They began stealing from one another and killing one another for the monetary gain. Rivers of blood shed for the single sake of greed. They had no cares for the laws of the creator, they simply made their own.
The humans wanted to create their own world. A perfect world of power and domination. No one submitted to no one. Women seeking power over men. Men seeking power over everything. They rebelled against their creator. After all, they were more wise in their own imaginations. One world power was believed to be the answer. They began to create bigger weapons of mass destruction. Any kind of destruction. Even their children’s games were teaching them destruction. Their intellectual technology enhanced their destruction. Their very greed led their way to destruction. These highly sophisticated two-legged creatures, where are they now?
For days since the storm, the flying creatures have searched for signs of life. They searched the ways to the North, only to return. They searched the ways of the south, to no avail. They searched the ways of the west, finding no refuge. The creature with wings they call an eagle led the others this morning to search the ways of the east. One last chance of hope.
We all liked the two-legged creatures for the most part. Not all sought destruction. Some built their lives on the rock. We’re all in hopes that these humans are still standing tall like the trees beside me. Deeply rooted. This time the flying creatures have been gone overnight. A new dawn is beginning to rise. The bright ray of hope shines through the gloomy grey skies.
A dolphin leaps into the air, chattering praises to the creator for the newness of life. I hear the eagle in the distance, singing a brand new song. I can faintly see something in his beak. Yes, I see hope on the horizon as I stand behind this cross. A new earth. A beautiful earth. Clean. Plentiful. Peaceful.
Fruits producing from the trees of life. Leaves bringing healings to the nations of the two-legged creatures that still stand tall after the storm. The humans are gathered before the great rock that came from the east. They are learning the ways of love. Their tools of mass destruction transformed into tools of cultivation. Hope shines brightly for their children.
Yes, a new dawn is rising, cultivating laughter, joy, peace, and love. As I stand firmly on this rock, hope is now in my sights. Hope riding on the wings of change. The eagle now lands before me, carrying in it’s beak a new lilly from a field. Hope. Yes. There is hope when you build upon the rock."

The king was frightened and convened all the artisans in the kingdom, commanding them to make a garland of water bubbles for the princess. Many young artisans were at their wit’s end and extremely anxious for fear of the princess’s disappointment.
One old craftsman claimed that he could do what she wanted on the condition that the princess be his consultant. The king was overjoyed and sent his daughter to the craftsman’s workshop. The craftsman told the princess, “I can make the garland, but I can’t tell nice water bubbles from ugly ones. Please bring me the ones you want, and then I will make them into a garland for you.”
The princess happily agreed and went to choose her water bubbles, but even after trying for a long time, she couldn’t catch a single one. Exhausted, she turned around and ran into the palace to tell her father, “Water bubbles are very pretty, but when I try to catch them, they don’t even last a moment. I don’t want them anymore.”
Suffering is rooted in clinging. The more deeply you realize the law of impermanence, the less overwhelming your suffering will be. If, for instance, you understand the impermanence of life, you can recover from the le vestetran of a loved one’s death.
The moon waxes and wanes, dim and bright, likewise, people can become happy or sad, together of seperated. This is the law of impermanence, and nobody can transcend it. If you understand this, your mind will open, and change won’t drive you to despair."

Anyone who thinks that such is cool, go ahead and have these scars, these tendencies to overreact, this panic when in new places or around strange faces!
The point I seek to make with this essay, a point I’ve sought to make before, is one that needn’t be made to those who actually care about people but one that I realize will never be grasped by those who condemn and refuse to understand people. That point is that most prisoners have been punished (for sins they didn’t commit) long before they came to prison and the carefully concocted punishments that are de rigueur in America’s prisons are, at best, futile.
When pushed in a corner, I’ve cut and stabbed too. I’m not bragging. The violence I experience prepared me, like a dog tortured to prepare him to fight: who’s really bad, the dog or the dog’s trainer?
No thanks to prisoncrats, I’ve committed to not using violence: my contribution to the revolution; my resistance. I refuse to contribute to the cycle of mayhem that is relied on by ----s to feed The Beast. This commitment is a struggle, but what helps me endure are the handful of dear friends I’ve made in and out of prison and my wish to spare others the sadism I’ve witnessed/experienced.

Absence gave birth to the words you see. I’ll never make it

How lonely life has become longing for you, my sole desire,
That I’ll never see come true. Oh, I don’t think you can

We humans blink our eyes almost 100 times in two minutes! The cliche that life is the “blink of an eye” is truly profound if we connect to the idea that time does not really exist. If we do not watch time, life flows more freely with moments passing quicker than expected. So we must not think of time or look at clocks, so that in the blink of an eye we may pass from this fleeting physical existence and transition through Saturn unto our higher selves. Saturn represents the death of our old selves and the transition of this life unto the next. May all sentient beings enlighten themselves!

Growing up is inevitable. Still, I wish I could find them small, beautiful, and innocent - just as I left them.
I also have to be grateful because both have amazing mothers. We don’t always agree, but it’s my job to be supportive and understanding because any decision they make affects the kids. I can’t be judgemental or get into arguments, and risk my only line of communication. If they kill that line, it’ll eventually kill me.
Sometimes, I do the baby talk and Daddy’s Little Princess loves it, but he doesn’t. He’s a “Big Boy,” he says, he wants Nerf guns, roller coasters, and made me promise we’ll jump off a plane in parachutes. I made that promise. On her 6th birthday, I asked her to stay 6 forever, she said, “I don’t know how” and I had a cuteness attack. According to her, I’m not allowed to date, and neither is she until she’s 18, that’s the deal, hopefully it lasts. She’s the jealous type, I’m hers and she’s mine, end of story, and I agree. At the same time, Big Boy gives all the girls Valentines cards, most of the classroom girls are his girlfriends, and all I can do is give him tips on being a gentleman.
Another year goes by. She’ll be 10 on October 26 and he’ll be 8 on November 26. They would’ve been born the same month, but Princess couldn’t wait to meet me, I guess, and Big Boy was the best deal I got after a Black Friday. Experiencing their birth was the weirdest and most wonderful happening ever. There’s no greater love, only the love of God for us, and He wants us to grow and learn. I’d love to tell them to stop growing, but I also want them to grow and learn, and right now, I couldn’t be more proud.
Should I try for parole which adds three more years, or max out when she’ll be 19 and he’ll be 17? I know the answer. In the meantime, I can close my eyes and see them just as I left them: small, beautiful, and innocent.
Love is patient and forgiving, and the only thing we feel that transcends the dimensions of time and space. Time is always short for those who need it, but for those who love, it lasts forever. I’ll love you Emely and Emmanuel until the end of time, and hope you love me and forgive me for missing all these years.
I invite you all to find ways to stay involved, it may be hard but love finds a way. One way I’ve stayed involved with my daughter is by having flowers delivered to her school on her birthday, she absolutely loves it. With my son, I send a gift for his birthday, books that he reads to me, and we keep each other updated on the hottest Reggaeton songs.
Blessings to all the fathers, stay involved, and remember - they will not stop growing."

He was the consummate survivor. His catchphrase “I see nothing! I hear nothing! I know nothing!”, makes him the master sage. As a young child it was hilarious. As an aged man, his wisdom is unsurpassable. At 20 years of age, I knew it all. Ah, to be that ignorant again. I knew exactly who I was, my purpose in life, and I had a solution to every ill of mankind. Being a favorite of the gods, exacerbated my egoism. Now these same gods have brought me to humility.

Don’t get me wrong, I was only ten- that made her fourteen.
And it must’ve been at least a half hour later- but this dude’s about eighteen… and a big sumbitch- too big to fight, I’ll tell ya that.
But when I stick my head out the “front” door, “checking the scenery” (peeping game) Toni says ‘they’re fine’, ‘they’re just talking’… and about five minutes later, this muthafucka’s tryna kiss my sister! (WTF?!)
We’re in the “Boonies”- don’t have a phone- and my momma’s working at a sweet potato wearhouse at least 25 miles away, with a different area code, so even if I could use one of my neighbors’ phone (WHAT!! NEIGHBORS??!!) they’d act kinda funny (as John Cougar Mellencamp sang) about it being: long distance... So I told him to leave.
Which is when- WHY!- shit hit the fan. He’s saying he ain’t leavin’- Toni’s saying ain’t nothing going on! Hollering at me…
So I go down the hallway, open the closet, stand on my tippy-toes and grab the milk crate that’s on the top shelf, with this and that… and momma’s .22 caliber revolver, long rifle- hollow points. Six shots… kinda quiet gun… and I open that other front door, and say “You think I’m playin?!!” They get the message.
But I had pointed the gun at him- and when Toni got hysterical screaming “what’re you doing” ……. I pointed it at her…
I went down the back steps, walked up on them- him, really. I cannot remember, but I think I bust a shot… not ‘at him’ but at him, know what I’m saying?... He takes his ass up that path…
Of course I went and put the gun up- but I don’t remember doing it. I just know I must have… because I went and used the toilet, and when I came out the bathroom, walked up the hallway- there’s Toni (sister of mine!) sitting in the chair in the living room.. With the pistol in her hand!, saying “you wanted to shoot me?” very calm, very quietly, when I had stopped stepping… us, eye to eye… saying she’d do it herself then (some such shit as that)...
I “knew”... I don’t know what that fuck, exactly, I knew, but I just did… so I kept trying to get the gun from her- she never got up out of the chair- but there was a lot of pushing me away with her other arm, shoving… and she pointed the gun at me, two handed (just like she had been taught how to shoot, target practicing) and time stopped…
It broke my heart that my bestest friend- my big sister!- wanted me dead; to shoot me. It froze me, all ten years of me… yet, I turned as cold when Toni turned the gun on herself, two-handed, and pushed the trigger back with her thumb…
The truth: I “knew”... I just, knew. Somehow…
I had turned from her, when she turned the gun to herself- I ran over to the couch. I was cryin’ like a bitch, screaming “No! Don’t!” And plugged my ears with my fingers… and buried my head in the laundry we were supposed to be folding, when I seen her thumb the hammer back…… and it locked. Cocked.
It sounded like one of those plastic cap-guns, with the red circle 8-shot caps circles you put in the revolver…
And I hated the world and God Himself, ever since…. Maybe still do;I’m not sure, now- stirring all these feelings up. You ever tried to write, with 33 year-old tears flooding your visual?
I shot out the door so hard and fast, the screen door slapped the trailer’s side loud as the gunshot. I screamed… I hollered… “HELP!!” over and over… and over… and ran straight up the field- barefooted, across rocks and broken bottle-glass… through a backyard of grass full of sand-spurs (STICKERS!) across that ole-two lane blacktop (it must’ve been 150 degrees, it was so God-Damn-Hot!)- and beat and banged on a latched screen door, until somebody came…
Momma…
Rescue-squad…
Hospital- weeks and weeks…
Intensive care- weeks and weeks…
Toni-
I’m glad you survived! I realize I’m hard to understand, but you are my sister, who I love very much. I’m proud of you… Know this: the world still kinda sucks, but God ain’t so bad- if not for Him, who really knows the outcomes- different, of that day…

Did I forget her birthday? To take out the trash?”
This feeling can hold a man hostage! I remember asking my uncle Chuy,
“I don’t understand girls.” He mumbled,
“Don't worry that’ll change. When you get older, you won’t understand women.”
It's uncomfortable on my comfortable sofa.
What is she thinking? In my head I begin to wonder, my conscience screaming, “squirm you measly worm!”
What I do know is that when she leaves this world in her mind I feel more lonely. Then I can stand; I become an island.
She won’t turn to look at me. The room is quiet. Maybe she only needs some “me” time? Do I get up and leave? Do I say something? What if I say the wrong thing?
The first time I laid eyes on her I was mesmerized. We met at a bar. We were just out relaxing on our own. I asked her, “What happens when an immovable object collides with an unstoppable object?”
She looked at me as if I was from another planet. She let me talk, was she listening? …
And I was even able to prove my theory that for every action there is an equal or opposite reaction. She was lost.
She said,
“All you have proven is that you know absolutely nothing about women.” I lost my nerve, I paid my tab and about to walk out when she said,
“Where are you going?”
I said,
“Home.”
“But the night is young,” she said.
I pull out my pen and write down my phone number and give it to her.
“When you want to teach me about women, call me.” A few days later my phone rings. “Hello,” I answer.
“Is this yon?”
“Who?” I reply.
“Thy guy I met at the bar.”
“Who?” And then I did remember. “Oh, hi, hello, how are you?” I say.
She laughs.
“Well, it’s good to know you gave me your real phone number. I’m glad you didn’t pressure me in anyway. Most guys just want one thing and well I thought you are genuine. I mean who would’ve known I’d actually like what you explained to me?”
I wanted to say, “well it was actually the alcohol talking because I really don’t know what I said,” but I said,
“Really? That's a first, not many people pay me that much attention. Really I was trying to impress you. Hey, what if we met somewhere? Where do you like to eat, how about dinner - your treat!” Why not? Women want to be independent so why not see if this was a miss independent?
She said,
“Ok, my treat but you got to explain why water is wet.” It took me all five seconds to guess “I got a live one here”. I said,
“Okay.”
That seems like it's been forever ago. That young woman now mature with real-world issues. Being independent, it seems the world finds reasons to hold her back. Once she explained,
“The hardest question a girl can ever be asked is ‘is it hard being a girl?’ Then she asked me, “Can you be a man in a woman’s world?” I know this was a question that needed an answer like no other,
“Women and girls of the 21st century wear their empowerment on their sleeves. But sometimes I think that all those ‘We can do it’ and ‘girls rule’ T-shirts are meant as much for their own reassurance as they are brave declarations to the world - mantras I hope will carry them into the future. “That they keep and should insist will be female,” I stated. She just stared at me as if I was from another planet. As a man I totally do get it that women are as valuable as the next man. Why can’t we just get along … Whoever coined the phrase “women, can’t live with them - can’t live without them,” understood their true value. But then there's the question, what happens to women when men fail, and the storyteller is a woman? My mother always spoke highly of my father. They spoke to each other with respect. Wasn’t that the deal maker, to have someone honor and respect you?
And watching her sit by the window, I wanted to say something so bad, and I decided to just speak and see what happens … So I say “It’s you I like, It’s not the things you wear, it’s not the way you do your hair, but it’s you I like.”
She is looking out of the window and then responds with,
“Please don’t think it's funny, when you want an extra kiss. There are lots and lots of people who sometimes feel like this.”
We were in the same room after all. Often all this time she has me guessing yet never disappointing.
“I’m here for you when you need me,” I told her. Her eyes turned to meet mine.
“What else could a woman need?” was all she said. She turned her eyes back out to the city and its endless sky. “After all … it’s for me to know and you to find out!”"

Janie was the silver-spoon fed teenager whom I’d coveted since she came to work at my Little Caesar’s. Blind Melon, 311, straight long hair, no makeup, about to leave for Chapel Hill in the fall...that kind of girl.
She wanted lawn seats. Of course.
They were the hardest set of words I’d ever had to say at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning, “Two lawn seats,” I protested. The Ticketmaster ticket mistress looked puzzled. She knew that I always camped at her door for front row seats. Janie tugged at my sleeve, signaling a trip down the used CD aisle for another “jam band” disc to torture me on the long ride home.
I never kissed Janie. I never held her hand. At 29, I just wanted to feel the things that she expressed so well. If love came, UNC would take it away. So I chose the innocence of roaming with Janie that summer.
I met my brother at Lollapalooza. He had won cheap seats, so we both longingly admired how high the stone wall loomed that separated us from The Ministry banging out industrial metal only twenty rows beyond. When I went back to find Janie, I almost tripped over her outstretched hand. I looked back and froze in the heart-catching tangles of her breeze-blown hair. She posed on elbows, an open book by her side. Who reads when The Ministry is on? Suddenly, I got it. As I looked around me, the autumn air whispered change while it did those magical things to my summer muse. Janie smiled her pseudo-hippie happy smile and danced while lying still. An illicit puff (or ten) later, I started to panic. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming! It was dark! People were gathering blankets in a pile! Fire!
I’d only danced once in my life, at the ill-fated wedding that I’d stumbled into with wife number one. I saw my brother spinning near the growing pyre. The band was playing “Give it Away,” and I ran into the melee. Lost in a sea of synchronized struts and flailing arms, I danced around the fire. We pushed and shoved. It was the end of communication… the birth of the internet. No one held up phones for a memory. Maybe we were just protesting the impending implosion of Kurt Cobain, but it felt like war to me.
The Chilis ripped into “Higher Ground,” and I thought about my dad explaining Kent State while Stevie played. Those “in the know” know that Anthony Kleidis spews the words until the band breaks into mosh-pit punk at its finest.
On that bridge stands Janie.
Janie is moving, but in a snapshot memory she forever stands still. Suddenly, she is an aggressive blur, charging towards me with that book outstretched towards our blaze. I know that it was only a few seconds, but at the cusp of everything it is forever. Janie hurls the book at something burning between us. She looks up in rage and almost flattens me with a thrown shoulder. It was more intimate than sex I’d imagined. It was deeper than love.
There were other songs, and yeah, we laughed a few more times after the fire that we shared had burned away. On the long ride home, we discovered the latest Juliana Hatfield CD together. It was called Become Who You Are, but when I checked it was almost midnight.
Janie left for college the next day. I haven’t spoken to her since.
Maybe that is what I was protesting. Maybe it was the change we both sensed that would lead Janie to Carolina blue, and me to the woman at Circle K who would become my wife only months later. Her name was Jeanie, an aberration of only one letter from perfection. On the lawn that September, we all stood at the brink of technology, but my next decade would only bring simple things, like the leukemia to a daughter that I hardly knew. It would bring another divorce and a son who was never really mine. It would bring the sudden death of a parent and close in prison at 39. I wonder what became of Janie.
This year, Lollapalooza will be streamed live and even available on TV. Thousands of people will scramble through Grant Park in Chicago, iPhones searching like periscopes for what my eyes saw in 1992. There will be no fire, only the lighter flame apps on books too expensive to toss in protest. Individually, social media will vent the rage that I felt until some kid buys a gun. I guess Janie would know better than I do, a dozen years removed from her world. I wish that I knew why she threw her book, or even what it was. The truth, however, is a feeble thing. It resides in the tone of my daughter, now 26 and cancer-free.
She packs her blanket and a book to see Lana Del Ray on her “Ultraviolence” tour, and Tara will lie on that same lawn where Janie and I burned so brightly in 1992.
I hope that Tara bumps into Janie there, too."

The first link in the chain was homelessness. Maybe not living on the street. But she had no stable ground‑ it always shifted, from day zero.
“Las Vegas,” she told me. “Then Seattle. Then Japan. Um, lots of airports. Christ. I don’t remember. Back to Vegas. Then Oregon. Then finally here.”
Here, Alaska, when she was twelve. I met her a couple years later. She told me everything. Matter-of-factly, like she was someone else she barely knew.
“He wasn’t always like this,” she said, “he” meaning her father. “This” meaning absent. Maybe not physically gone. But cold and distant. Occasionally mean. Working too much. Absent. The third link in the chain.
Oh, what was the second?
“He used to LOVE me,” she said, putting a little too much honey on the word. She even winced slightly, like the word tasted funny. “You wouldn't believe the kinds of clothes he bought me. This thong? Yup. He bought me this.”
I can’t even tell you link four. It’s actually a whole fucked-up series of links, long and tangled enough to make me lose count. And I’m not allowed to talk about it. But worse, much worse, is that SHE’S “not allowed” either. Maybe not because she’ll be punished by prison guards, but by society. Social recoil‑ or unwelcome prurience. A family that would rather not rewind explicit scenes. The dirt has long been safely swept under the bed. Further links in the chain.
“I like calling you ‘Daddy,’” she murmured, licking my mouth. I kissed her back, intoxicated. By her beauty, by idvenous lust, by the egomania of being her surrogate God. Intoxicated as in poisoned, as in the body feels good, but the mind is sick.
“I love you,” I said, and meant it, but it doesn’t absolve me. I was the next link in her chain.
I study the prostitutes. Not dispassionately. But soberly. One cocks a hip, in an expert pantomime of provocation. The chains are long. She never had a chance.
That’s my girl!"

Some of the people where I come from in Boston, Massachusetts would have had a mental meltdown by now; why not me? Well, I can only attribute it to my walk in Christ and my willingness to do His Will and help those lost souls. One day a few weeks ago I said, “Lord, I’m so tired of all this noise, dealing with two roommates who fight all the time, everyone who walks through my cell door having problems they need me to solve.” I said, “Lord I need a little peace and quiet.” Three days later I was put into solitary confinement for a misunderstanding...at first I was really upset because in five and a half years I’ve never run afoul of the authorities, not so much as a warning...but after day two of lying peacefully in my one man room, listening to the quiet, I knew God had answered my prayer (Thank You Jesus)...
In the three weeks I’ve been in here, I’ve gotten into working out again, lost about ten pounds, shaved off my fro-hawk, gotten deeper into my Bible studies...all and all I’ve been able to strengthen myself, physically, mentally, and most importantly spiritually. I’ve been blessed to come across a book called “The Resolution for Men” by Steven and Alex Kendrick, with RAndy Alcorn. Every Man must read this book. It tells men to step up, be the men God created us to be, raise our children so they don’t grow up Yelling, Screaming, Arguing, and Fighting like first and second graders. Though this may not be me sitting alone on a dock, in peace, talking to God and enjoying the beauty He created, it is me, sitting alone, talking to God, At Peace, seeing the beauty He is creating in me.
God Bless You All!

By an unlucky coincidence, Dee Gee will catch that Blue Bird bus back to prison. He promised to send me a Korean girl.”
She patted my knee. “Second generation, yes. You’re two months younger than me, baby boy! I don’t mind being your Korean girl, but you’re my Baby Boy!”
My train of thought moved onward to the next car in the train of coincidences. “Princess told you about the stunt she pulled when she threw the baggie in my lap to entrap me. By coincidence, you told me in the restaurant that you’re no longer a peace officer. When I showed you Joker Box 31, you said your problems are an order of magnitude more serious than entrapment.”
She patted my knee again. “Princess told me her dark, drizzle story. You caught the entrapment on video. She has to give you some sex to get the video. Hey, who entrapped who? Princess’ word is good. You took a rain check? Princess will pay.”
“By coincidence, when we came out of the restaurant, there was a very young woman standing across Main Street, under her umbrella, watching. You’re a trained observer. You saw her watching us.”
“She was very young, wasn’t she? We need to call her something. We’ll call her Baby Girl. She was indiscrete. I trained my children not to stare.”
“Give it up! Who you riding with? Federal Bureau of Investigations? Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives? Immigrants and Customs Enforcement?”
Abbey Red made the right turn onto Airline Drive. “Yes, I’m with Homeland Security, but I’m on administrative leave while they investigate me. I shot someone important. No, I don’t know who Baby Girl really is. She might be one of my children from Homeland Security, but maybe not.”
“Is this ‘Spy versus Spy’ from MAD magazine?
“No. A federal grand jury might have indicted me. Baby Girl might be watching so they can plan when to arrest me.”
“There’s a U.S. Supreme Court case, Miranda v. Arizona.”
“An ex-cop knows her Miranda rights.”
“Your first Miranda warning is most important. You have the right to remain silent. Don’t tell me anything.”
Abby Red sighed. “It’s headline news; all America knows.”
“Your second Miranda warning amplifies the first. Anything you say will be used against you. When the U.S. Attorney questions me, I’m snitching! Quick, fast, and in a hurry!”  “Humph! What a friend you are, Baby Boy!”
“If you tell me nothing, then I can’t snitch.”
Abbey Red made the connection. “My Miranda rights can really rain on Government’s parade.”
“Government is raining on yours. You’ve got an umbrella like Baby Girl had. Your umbrella is Miranda v. Arizona.
She laughed lightly. “Baby Girl might be named Miranda.”
“Baby Girl might be holding Miranda, the umbrella. Better than being left holding the bag.”
“Baby Girl Miranda in the rain, yeah. What a picture that makes.”"

I made my living as a baker/pastry chef. Many of my jobs required that I work the “graveyard” shift. Getting off work at 7:00, I rarely felt like eating breakfast. In those days breakfast consisted of a couple of “slim-jims” and a six-pack. I still ate plenty of boxed cereal (mainly Captain Crunch with Crunchberries) but saved them for when I got the munchies.
After the birth of my daughter Kriste, I too fed her pre-sweetened cereal. She preferred “Kix”, dry, right out of the box. In 1987, my wife and I “separated.” She remained in Seattle and I ventured off to my mother’s house in Illinois. It was there in the small hamlet of Sauk Village that breakfast took on a whole new meaning for me. The women of Sauk Village, single or “not-that-married,” all hung out at the two watering holes located on each end of the village, the “Upfront” and “Casey’s Tavern.” Newly single and from the west coast, the pickings were easy. It reminded me of fishing for salmon in the Snohomish River during spawning season. I am not the stereotypical guy who after “hooking-up” impatiently awaits his newest conquest to leave. I’ve personally never understood that. In my mind, it makes much more sense to “snuggle” afterwards and then invite her to a hot, soapy bubble bath. Look, if a gal goes home with you and the two of you hook-up, treat her good. Not like a whore or a hood-rat. Snuggle, bathe her, give her a massage and then try and talk her into spending the night? If you can rock like that, I guarantee she’ll rock you back in the morning and, if she’s good, invite her back! How does one coax a girl to stay the night? Offer a her a fine breakfast cuisine in the morning. Trust me, it works. My specialty is either eggs benedict or New York strip steak, broiled with chili and cheese topping. But, beware! If you are not seeking a long-term relationship, LET HER KNOW! IF not, you may have laid the ground-work for a Fatal Attraction. Suggest being friends with benefits.
Today, I am 54 years old. Memories of all of those different “styles” of having breakfast live in a warm place in my heart. Now every morning I wake up at 6:00 am, walk outdoors for 100 yards or so, wait in a long-line of 200 hungry prisoners, and then gratefully “catch” my plastic tray which had been flung uncaringly out of the 18” square hole in the wall. The food is always the same and always disappointing. Powdered eggs, nonfat milk, Frisbee-like waffles and pancakes, mystery meat sausage patties, soy creamed beef, and dry coffee cake. Choke it all down with a cup of scalding hot watered down coffee and voila! Breakfast! Still sound like the most important meal of the day? If so, Bon Appetit!"

Marriage, the state of being lawfully united to the opposite sex as husband or wife; an act of marriage(1 Cor7:14)... for the wife brings holiness to her marriage and husband bring holiness to the marriage(Gen2:24) God gave marriage as a gift to Adam and Eve. They were created perfect for each other.
Marriage was not for convenience, nor was it brought about by culture. It was instituted by God and it has three basic aspects. (1) The man leaves his parents and, in a public act, promises himself to his wife. (2) The man and woman are joined together by taking responsibility for each other's welfare and by loving the mate above all others. (3) The two are united into one in the intimacy and commitment of sexual union that is reserved for marriages, a strong marriage is how many guests showed up at your wedding or how huge the hall you rented is? Or the place you went for honeymoon, it is by centering yourself around Christ who is the cornerstone and the foundation which you and your spouse stands on, known as unity.
Next time you plan to marry someone or someone plan to marry you think of the true value and factors of being wed, there’s calamity, ups and downs, trial, tribulation and all intertwine into being wed are marriage also there’s hope, joy, love, kindness as well but most of all as long as God is first and is centered in the midst all will be well. So I ask you: let us get back to the basics of what’s important: living in Holy matrimony in love and in truth committed under God almighty."

Here, we, for the most part, suppress our feelings for we don’t want to be seen as weak. But when it comes to family, sometimes we must just put that foolish pride to the wayside. To keep these feelings pent up we will eventually forget how to let them out, how to express ourselves. It will eventually turn into a wave of anger that consumes the soul. Grown men do cry--even in here.
This girl in this picture to me represents a life that could have been. A life cut short. It also portrays the cockiness of innocence, freedom of the heart, and hope that there are those with decent ideals.
Monique today could be doing something, perhaps looking at her fingernails pondering what she is going to be doing later, tomorrow, next week--next year. Just chillin’, living for a moment.
In one event so many years ago, my life was changed from fatherhood to a mourning parent full of grief and guilt. The what-if’s forever implanted into my conscious mind. Monique is free today. I’m not in so many ways."

My legs loosened up and felt great. I really enjoy nature. What that is seen by walking is missed by those who travel by train. Everyone I know who travels by train is too in depth with conversation to enjoy the beauty. It mimics what you only see on TV.
Three hours in my walk, I came upon a bridge made out of truss. It looked solid and with one foot trying my weight, my confidence built strong enough to go forward, my hopes were high now.
The sun high over head, my body needed energy and rest. The pack on my back had four days’ rations, along with two canteens full of water that had been frozen. What else could a person want.
Hours went by and the sun was on its downhill motion. The stars would be my roof and the ground, my bed. For those who love the outdoors, this is like home. Better than a room at the Hilton. Should I be lucky enough, I just might see a few shooting stars. That would be great.
The sky was just getting a little hue to it. Time to make tracks, our motto in the South. If you camp in the woods, you leave it just like you found it. No trash, foot prints, and no burning embers. We lose so much forest due to people not caring.
The tracks were taking on a strange shape to them as I ventured on. I like to use V.W.R. (visual walking rules), not to mixed up with V.F.R. (Visual Flying Rules) -- what pilots use. Here in the woods, you have to watch where you step and stay focused on your surroundings. I hope it isn’t too complicated. For every step a person takes, a snake could be close by.
The fog laid heavy on the tracks. I really felt this could be the reason for the odd shape. My pace slowed. If you have even had the hair on the back of your neck stand up, you will follow your instinct and back pedal. I felt lured to travel forward. The fog just didn’t seem like it was going to burn off. Now my chest began to burn and I noticed my breathing was fast. I tried my best to control it and still walk. Something just wasn’t right.
Get off the tracks and out of the fog. There in my body, I could sense the sudden danger. Almost all the time, my feelings are right. Through my shoes, my feet felt the vibration. My fear of an earthquake flashed through me. The trees seemed stable enough.
My feet were well off the tracks now. I barely could make it out. A train that I knew hadn’t been on these tracks in years. This train showed no signs of slowing. A sound of picking up speed told me I didn’t want to be close.
The tracks, as I glanced down, still showed rust. I know for sure I saw this train. Even felt the wind from it. Really glad my feet moved and I was out of the way. It sure would have torn me apart.
I headed back home. This was one adventure that was over by Sudden Danger."

The blackouts, waking up in places that I cannot remember going to or how and the hell I got there. One time I remember lying on the Louisiana Gulf Coast then finding myself in Corpus Christi Texas a four days later, I wonder how many people out there can relate to this.
There have been lights, can wrecko and waking up in jail none accomplishment of a same and righteous life, I have let many people down so many times.
I go through the paces of life. I have explored the possibilities. I have accomplished some goals only to later squander them in pursuit of something better. It seems the more that we have the more we want. It appears that we can never have enough, on that we need more and better.
I see animals around this farm, they can leave if want yet they stay. They are happy with what they want, even within the core lines of prison walls, They seem to have accomplished all that they want set out for. Food, shelter, and to reproduce. Nothing more, nothing less. The fends, cats, and nats due free within these walls.
Human life is so much more complicated. So much competition, displeasure and discord. We live with hatred and anger. Jealousy and envy have their part too. It’s a small wonder that there is anything left of the human race with all of the extra luggage we carry in a day to day life. The main thing men here have accomplished is getting ourselves locked up for long periods of time. All of the persistive things in our lives have been turned negative
In prison everything changes, we seek to accomplish renewed freedom while we understand that our lives have changed, nothing will ever be the same. Some of our right are misdeed and in so many ways we all frowned upon by society.
I think though we can once again have some success with perseverance to overcome the stigma that comes with the overwhelming odds we are faced with after incarceration. We can still accomplish late in life. Happiness and peace of mind can be acquired but will take work.
I have known love which is a great accomplishment for truly it is better to have loved and lost than to have never been loved at all. The greatest accomplishment I can think of would be to die happy–knowing that my life isn’t in vain. To die with a free spirit."

Do whatever you can, with whatever you have, wherever you are, right now. Hang your socks by the vent in your cell as a token to your faith. Any 350-pound rascal who can fly a set of reindeer all over the world in one night...well, that rascal can put coffee in your socks. It’s the season of hope, y’know? Hang your socks. Santa Claus can accomplish his mission.
At 0930 hours they brought lunch trays. They didn’t return the commissary lists. The season of hope continued. Santa Claus might be loading his sleigh. Maybe...just maybe.

Right behind the Chow Cart came the bedraggled Commissary Girl with her elfish-looking trusty's pulling commissary sled!

As he ducked for cover behind a barricade of boxes, he cowered behind, looking out with his back to her. She took one blue bomb and gave her best war cry as she propelled it from her hands and down into his head.
She laughed with glee as he stood there, rocked and disoriented as to the origin of the assault. She screamed in primal fury as the other two were already in route and hit him in the face and chest-one, two-as he turned in her direction.

I suppose it was from the lack of food and water. It was still no reason to not go on. The spirits do things for a reason and I would do my part by trusting their plans for me. I would not give up. I would not fail them. I continued on. Later that evening, the wolf stopped. It allowed me to walk right up to it. So I sat down on the ground in front of it expecting some great revelation to happen. It did, I feel into a deep trance like sleep.
As I was sitting there locked in this trance, a vision unfolded. Five wolves, a cadaverous thin mother wolf and four half-grown cubs, came up to the spirit wolf and smelled him. He rubbed muzzles with the female and then as one, they turned their eyes to me.
Desperate hunger and slavering chops surrounded me. The she-wolf locked on my throat as the younger pack members ripped open my stomach and began to feed on my intestines. I lay there watching the spirit wolf watch me being devoured alive. Just watching the pack gobble down hunks of my flesh that they had ripped from my living body. Before I could think, before I even realized it was not a vision but was actually happening it was almost over. My last sight as the darkness came was the she-wolf’s eyes looking straight into mine as she lapped up the blood leaking from my throat.
Turns out that animals have guardian spirits too. The she-wolf’s mate had been killed during a hunt and her and their litter would have starved to death if he hadn’t come back and led me, the weakest prey he could find, right to them. Before moving on to the next world, he insured that his family would survive in this one. Who would have known?"

But deep down I know they just don’t get it. Besides, Julius is cool and I’d rather spend my time with fly people vs. fox of the non-existent reich supremacists, who in all actuality are not even really foxy supremacists but merely blending into the mold of the preconceived “code” of ignorance and adjoining hoopty-doopty that’s been pervading these places since 1932 something or other era of nincompoopery.
...Are we not all from the same fabric of the universe, the same stars of unified purpose, the same magma of life that erupted into the surface of this world a long, long time ago? Don’t we all live on Earth and ultimately depend on one another for mutual survival if we are to explore the galaxies and live forever in this mortal reality? Don’t we all have the same mother, the very same beginning and pulse of Purpose and destiny? Who has time for quarrelling with his brothers and sisters over such a thing as fur color and goosy territory and stereotypes? Does that seem like a “superior” and “intelligent” thing to do?
But God help them all, nobody can understand or comprehend this little pea of knowledge rattling around in my little fox brain. Some of my fox people think they and I should be “better” than geese like my brother Julius. They sit over there at “that” table (like high school) gossiping on the late neuron morsels of “foxy Superiority” and “furry domination.” But the truth is, I don’t want to conquer anyone BUT MYSELF. And I did, at least to the point where I realized the psychological thinking errors of my own primordial stupidity and the overall insignificance of my genetic fur tone in the face of the entire universe! I realized I...just like all things...are stars. Born out of pure impossibility at the very beginning of all time. I realized that we are all beings of life and creation and my true “family” is all things and living beings. So I push my brother Julius. Not because I’m “trying to be a goose” but because I move with a Higher Purpose. I kick it with him out of Universal Oneness, not ignorance simply because he’s “a goose” who quacks and has an orange beak, like some of his friends do. Limit my “own kind” to simply foxes? Hahaha, what a crime that’d be!
Me and my homeslice Julian lean on each other. He’s the funniest goose alive and keeps me quacking up. And my only skill as a fox is not merely limited to pushing a cart with my “G” in it, I also tattoo and Julius is dying to get his one remaining limb and foot done with some bad-freaking-ass Japanese traditional.

Families hid or fled in fear from blood thirst death squads, military bombings, and oligarch-created right wing paramilitaries.
As time went on, at the end of the eighties and early nineties, the love and unity in my family remained unchanged. However, family reunions were less common. The family had also grown in numbers. Birthday parties and baby showers allowed for some reunions.
In El Salvador the carnage continued. Tens of thousands were indiscriminately being murdered. Women, children, and the elderly; whole families wiped out in seconds. Community leaders and the religious, even foreigners, suffered the same fate. Death was no longer feared; it had become expected. But the people united.
My family kept growing in the U.S. Growing in numbers and growing apart. Family reunions became rare.
Thankfully, by the mid-nineties, the Civil War came to an end. A peace accord was signed. Those that survived the horror made their way back to the towns and villages they had fled and found them completely destroyed. Amid the rubble, they found the remains of their loved ones. There was a haunting smell of death and smoke in the air. Dead or alive, people felt a sense of comfort with reuniting with their family members. It was a new opportunity to recreate their family. They didn’t ask for it, but they were glad to be alive to do it.
By the late nineties, there was perhaps one family reunion comparable to the ones we had when we first arrived in the U.S. from El Salvador. Personal feuds, resentment, unkept promises, unaccomplished expectations, lack of unity when situations got bad were some of the factors that dissolved the tradition of family reunions.
While the situation in the home country began normalizing, my family split apart. Where the dust settled and families rebuilt their lives in El Salvador, my family moved far away from each other. Two or three cities over.
At the end of the nineties, the new generation of my family was in full bloom. As kids, they grew up around each other, as time went on they casually spoke to each other and by chance would sometimes meet up. The home country was nothing but a detail of their parents’ past and the Civil War simply something that occurred of little importance today.
Family reunions? Never again, not the kind that we had when we first got to the U.S. My family became sort of “cliquish” and apathetic to one another. It’s almost as if when we sought refuge from civil war, we were celebrating the survival of our family. Survival and unity away from the horror of war. But as the Civil War ended so did my family’s spirit of inseparability. The survival of our entire family, the oneness amongst us, the love and joy that embraced us all at family reunions ended with the Civil War in El Salvador. But we were in the U.S."

Even the great philosopher Socrates recognized this when he said, “An unexamined life is not worth living.” One must reason, then, that to take an opportunity to step back and evaluate yourself- our strengths and weaknesses, our dreams and fears- is required in order to truly be permitted to live. In the same way that an architect inspects the foundation of an area before he finishes his blueprint, we must see who we are at the base in order to build ourselves into all that we can be.
We all live in our own fog. Maybe it’s out in “that world” and maybe it exists in a world of steel bars and concrete. Maybe it’s drugs or negative social influences.

Nothing gives me a feeling of peace like visualizing the numerous flowers grandma introduced me to.
I learned to make dolls for my little sisters from hollyhocks; to tell time by the flowers on Four O’clocks; to make a Snapdragon roar and how to make its pods explode in a shower of seeds. It seems that every flower in our garden had a secret or some amazing characteristic to tantalize my young mind.
Year after year throughout my childhood I experienced the flowers with and through my grandma. Every spring we turned the soil; Grandma with her spade and me with an old spoon, later growing up enough to handle a trowel and much later replacing Grandma on the business end of the spade.
Once the soil was turned and the clouds smoothed over we put the tiny seeds to bed, covering them with a blanked of healthy, aromatic soil and settling shower of misty water.
I was always rewarded with the honor of being allowed to hold the water hose to moisten the soil into a soothing blanket for the baby seeds so they would get plenty of sleep and wake up to grow into strong, beautiful plants able to produce radiant flowers.
Even this simple, mundane chore afforded Grandma the opportunity to share the wonders of our world and rewards of gardening. Putting the seeds to bed took a backseat to my having my own rainbow. I focused on creating rainbows and forgot all about misting the soil, while Grandma laughed and praised my rainbow skills. Sixty years later I still hear Grandma’s voice in every rainbow I see.
After the seeds were put to bed came the worst part of the gardening for me...waiting! Every morning I woke up and rushed outside to see how many of my baby seeds had awoken. I can recall the disappointment when day after day, not a single sprout appeared. I feel the same six decades later.
Weeding, watering, and waiting were the fundamentals of my following days. Each day I watched as my children grew tall and strong, changing every hour, right before my eyes, until that first bud appeared. I was hardly able to leave the garden, knowing that bud would soon explode into a vibrant flower...with hundreds more to follow.
When you see this grizzled old recluse walking the yard alone, don’t bother me...I’m walking through the flowers of my mind."

To this day, I don’t know how or where that island is. I do know nobody wants to drink from it. I guarantee it!"

Thwarted for seeking triumph,

See if I stand on a corner I’m thwarted,
A target
A sore thumb to be martyred as a product of a generation who never chose to be brought up
If I even find success I’m thwarted by thwart,
From those who feel they froze my mark, and oppose my art
But the root that grows of thwart will never expose my skin or my heart
I see thwart in starch, I see thwart in clovers in march
That’s why I speak folgers to wake up the sharp to play their parts and march

I can look towards my future and not be overcome with fear, depression, and self pity. I've set goals for myself, learned how to hope and dream once again, and I have aspirations that drive me everyday to live better, to become better than I was the day before. I must surround myself with positive reinforcements, true encouragements, and those with similar thoughts and feelings. I can't afford to lose this bit of progress I've made by allowing the wrong people to remain In my life, or to enter my life. To regress back into that hopeless empty cask would surely mean the death of me. I refuse to die, to backslide into that blackhole that is my past.
Gods helping hand has changed the way I perceive my surrounding myself, and my future. I've fully submitted myself to Allah, to living how he wants me to, and to whatever happens to me.

A figure passes by the cell door. Getting up, I run out to see a female guard just outside of my cell. She’s standing in the moon’s light coming through the window.
“Are you ready to go?” she asks in a soft, tender voice. Then a guard walks right through both of our bodies, only to have stopped at cell A-18. The alarm sounds and the cell door opens. The lights inside the cell have stopped flickering. The TV is on the late night comedy.
Slowly, I start to walk closer to her and we start down range. Getting to the steel door, there’s two more inmates standing there. Looking up range, I see they’ve closed my cell door.
We walk through the gate into the darkness of night. We go down the walkway, staying in between the yellow lines. One inmate disappears with his mother and the other inmate vanishes, holding his wife.
We head on down the path to where the grass and flowers are. There, before my eyes, my ol’ dog Buster is wagging his tail. He drops a ball at my feet and as we float up into the moonlight, we play fetch. The closer we came to the clouds, the female guard turned into an Angel. Her wings white as the moon.
There before us, the gates the heaven. The gates open as the ball goes through. Ol’ Buster runs into Heaven and there holding his ball is my wife. The gates close behind me as I held her. The feeling of being loved once again consumed me and looking at my wife, I was truly thankful that God opened Heavens gates to me.
“Thy Love” by James Schmidt
The last of the sun’s rays fell upon her for the last time. Her green eyes gazed upon thee as her body fell to the ground. Her soul was gone like leaves in the wind. She was dead as the day dies when the moon rises in the night sky. She was gone like waves in the sea. She was gone to all that loved her.
Standing there, thy listened for her voice; it never came, though crickets sang loudly. The darkest night, the rains beat down then snowflakes floated to the ground. It turns into a very cold night. Thy brown eyes look all around though they could not find her.
To my heart’s content, thy pray to see her again. The clouds part in the sky, the full moon shines down on thee, it makes me feel like the world is mine. With thy arms stretched out to the skies, looking deeply at the moon. Thy cry out for thy love
Missing her with every heartbeat. Thy look to the forest floor, seeing thy love in the moonlight. There in the moonlight, we held each other tightly. The clouds float in the sky covering the moon, thy sadness ‘tis gone for I am with her now. Now, when the light of the full moon shines down on the earth, we walk together hand in hand ever so briefly.
“Thy Freedom” by James Schmidt
The breeze so wild
The sun’s rays so warm
The tree’s so high
The flowers so beautiful
The ocean so quiet
The air so crisp
The earth so free
‘Tis thy freedom they long for!

The sort of comedian who can’t let a good opportunity for a joke to pass. He started out in prison a little timidly, not thinking he could use his talents for protection. Not in a prison! But he couldn’t contain his inner jester. He finally found his balance and used his skills--a mixture of verbal sparring, physical clumsiness and a face that can express any emotion he desires no matter his real feelings.
I have done a lot of time and am still amazed at the magic-like ability Melvin has to resolve a situation with the power of laughter. How he makes the most serious things seem funny. One time, I saw Melvin in one of his many elements. We were in the day room area of our section where he was playing cards while I watched TV. A dispute began over some perceived slight on Melvin’s behalf toward one of the more hardened convicts (I’ll call him JJ). I didn’t see how it started, but when I looked over, I saw Melvin on the floor with JJ looming over him. The section became silent. I felt despair creep over me like a smothering blanket. “Whatya gotta say bout that?” J.J. shouts down at Melvin. “You little f___! Get up and let’s handle it!” Melvin sits there a moment longer, scoots back away from J.J., and slowly stands up. Fixing himself, he steps back another couple steps, watching J.J. from under his slightly bowed head. He looks up and smiles one of his best smiles and softly says to J.J., “If we came here for any other reason than our crimes, it certainly wasn’t to enjoy ourselves with violence and grovelling. But I’m pretty good at grovelling when the situation calls for it.”
Silence. J.J. stands there unsure how to handle this unknown reaction. I notice his lips quiver slightly, like two worms having sex. Someone in the crowd snickers, which sets everyone to laugh. J.J.’s body relaxes and a smile appears on his face--ending the illicit sex--and he steps forward, slapping Melvin on the shoulder and says, “I’ll take care of the violence then, you little f__.” Melvin grabs his arm in mock pain. Grimacing dramatically with his expressive face, “That’s a relief. I’m terrible at violence!” Very funny! I feared he was a dead man, but it was him that did the killing.
Time’s easier to bear for those living around Melvin. Laughter eases the anxiety that is implicit with life inside. Our overall situations aren’t comical, but to be able to laugh at everyday things, and at oneself, with others, life becomes a little easier."

This is the final stage of their diss-game, and they reason why it is at this stage that many of their victims decide that it is time to quit overlooking their incivility, quit feeling sorry for them and become immune to their epithet, “Racist!” The people who like to exploit others and love to call themselves “thugs”, think that hiding inside a gang of cowards gives them protection. Mostly, it does make them safe, but only up to a breaking point. For instance:
I was once forced to live with a Nazi dopie who thought he was hot shit because he had a girlfriend stupid enough to bring him dope. He had all kinds of other dopies on his hook, whom he played unmercifully. I didn’t want his dope, and his inability to make me want something from him rankled. I politely endured his control-freak BS for weeks. He liked to lay up on the top rack, daydreaming and feigning sleep, making me tiptoe around him. Then he mumbled a throat about my quietly crinkling a cheetos bag. I got the powerstrip that the cops had made me buy when they stole my extension cord. I used it to smash his nose and break out his teeth. His “gang” of friends didn’t like him either. They only liked his dope. He realized:
When you’re an asshole, there is no protection."

I clenched my muscles tightly and crossed my arms for more warmth. The night wasn’t windy; it was actually very still, but the sky was cloudless. The stars glistened with such vibrant contrast like Christmas lights on a festive evergreen. The moon was so big and bright that it was like a spotlight that was focused on me to guide my way.
I felt like an astronaut that just exited his module and made his first step on a martian planet never explored by mankind. This must have been what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin felt when they landed on the moon. Every star and nebula they have seen seem to be completely different ones.
I have seen the stars before, but now I was miles out in the country. Here I could see them much better than back when the city lights of my hometown interfered with the visibility of this magical world above. I searched the constellation for Orion and looked at the three stars along his belt. Those stars are in perfect alignment with the pyramids of Giza in Egypt. I imagine to myself that I am in Giza right then, looking at the stars that inspired such a marvel of the world.
Just by staring at the stars, I could take a quantum leap of sorts to any destination in the universe. An out of body experience better than any Tryptamine could offer. I was soaring on Haley’s comet, jumping out, and taking a dip in the oceans of the Jovian satellites of Europa. Swimming in the strange chemistry of the planet and the exotic species that inhabit it, I took a sip of the fluids that overflow out of the Big Dipper. I danced to the percussion beat of the pulsars and figure skated on the ice rings of Saturn.
At that moment, I was the astro-median that could look centuries into the past. I could bask in the wonders of the cosmos, roast marshmallows off the thermic rays emitting off of the star, breathe in the diatomic gas from the atmosphere that surrounds me, and watch the quasar light show.
As my mind drifted off, my body was discovered back on the walk. I was paralyzed from the stars and pulled 3,670 million miles back to earth by the sergeant yelling at me for being out in the walk for so long. He took my DOC number and said that he was going to write me up on an Out of Place #366 for staying out too long and making them go look for me. I can’t be mad because if they only knew how far I escaped that time, he would have thrown me in the SHU.
I went back to the unit and made up my mind that I would never take the wonder of the universe for granted again. I will travel to the desolate deserts of Arizona with a sleeping bag and telescope and take that wonderful exploration through the Dark Matter of space again. Allow the stars to light my way."

Our shorts-and-t-shirt attire was easily explained by the assurance that we were going to change over at our friend’s house, and we made a big show of packing up our formal dress wear. My dad had given me permission to use the SUV, a green GMC Jimmy; what he didn't know was that Angie had spent the last twenty minutes pulling camping gear out of our storage shed and passing it to me over the backyard wall, while I used my tetris skills to load the back of the Jimmy.
Our first stop was the grocery store to purchase hot dogs, chips, marshmallows, and other junk food, and to fill up our five-gallon water jug. Then we headed north out of the city in search of a nice camping spot. I had never really paid attention to where my dad drove when we went camping, but I figured it wasn’t rocket science: you drive until you hit desert, you find a flat place without any cacti, and you set up camp.
After a time, the two-lane highway bent eastward and with the setting sun blinding me in the rearview mirror, I realized it was already four-thirty. We needed to find a spot soon while we still had daylight.
I spied a likely-looking dirt road and turned onto it, mentally crossing my fingers. We were in luck! The desert terrain on both sides was amazingly flat: no large, unpleasant rocks, and little sign of cacti-- or any desert flora, for that matter. I drove for another five minutes before turning off at an indiscriminate location, pulling forward another fifty feet or so and parking. Time to set up.
Sngie was busy digging the fire pit and I was pounding stakes for the tent when I noticed three vehicles in the distance, driving toward us across the desert plain. One of them had flashing lights. As they approached, we heard a voice yell over a loudspeaker: “Stop what you’re doing immediately! Do not move!”
It turned out that Angie and I had ventured onto the Yuma Proving Grounds, and there were unexploded bombshells and other ordnance all around us. At any moment, either one of us could have struck paydirt.
The military police took out IDs, ran background checks, and quickly realized we were two dumb teenagers. All I remember saying was, “Please don’t tell our parents!” They didn’t, but they escorted us off the property and admonished us to never return. We didn’t.
But we did go to the prom party. :)"

The problem with that religiously inspired1 theory is that your will comes from your mind, your mind comes from your brain, your brain is made of matter and not only is matter affected by other matter (energy too is matter- e=mc2) but the brain is an organ designed to be affected by material experiences.2 Laws of both physics and neuroscience make any theory of “free” will impossible.
So, we don’t have “free” wills. But we do have wills and highly developed prefrontal cortices, which generally enable us to consider our options and potential consequences before we act out our wills, like a chess game, ideally, generally.
But we “decide” many things in the blink of an eye, based on instincts (e.g. fight-or-flight from a perceived danger) and/or emotions (e.g. anger, desire), both of which came into play during my near tongue-ectomy. We may analyze shit afterwards, but, “What’s done cannot be undone…”
Those of us who’ve been raised/ trained in environments saturated with fear for our safety, worry about where we’ll get money for food or rent. We were anguished about our bodies being violated by someone who’s supposed to care for us, or one of the other 10 most widely recognized Adverse Childhood Experiences (A.C.E.s): exposure to such “Chronic Toxic Stress” (C.T.S.)3. These environments can train us to overreact to perceived threats or stressors, as I did at that house party, as many of us did when we did the things we did that landed us in prison.4 In such cases, it is not rational or justifiable to condemn such people by claiming that they “freely” “chose” to do something that hurt themselves- no sane person chooses to hurt themself, but that’s what we did by committing crimes (I’m not addressing those few prisoners who plotted, deliberately, to prey on others, as politicians often do).
You learn things in prisons and other dangerous environments I’ve been in, such as: there is no escape when you’re threatened and calling me a bitch is a threat, that severely punishing the violator is your safest “choice”, your only choice, even if the administration punishes you for it. Violence and threats at home prepared me for that education. From reading Sheila LaBarre’s essay “The Vow” and Dillon Gresham’s essay “Guardian Angel,” as well as from many conversations I’ve had with fellow prisoners, I know that I am not the only one in prison who scores 10 on the A.C.E. survey and was trained to overreact in ways that I’ve seen shock most people.
It’s a little comfort, knowing I’m not alone.
I hope it comforts others, knowing that their past mistakes are not evidence that they’re “evil”.
Those who’ve been through C.T.S., who score high on the A.C.E. survey, if you can, check out a Mindfulness group, try yoga, which helps me calm down.
My Best,
Nate
1For Westerners, it is hard to accept that people’s wills are not free from their past experiences/ training. It is hard because it has been hammered into our Zeitgeist that we have “free” wills, as part of our monotheist heritage. (God would be a monster if he damned sinners who were born or bred to sin in a particular way, such as homosexuals, addicts,etc. Our society would likewise be “evil”...)
2If a person’s spirit or soul is not made of matter/ energy, is immaterial, then such a spirit or soul cannot influence their brain and thus does not “matter” when considering the nature of our wills.
3In a 23 Feb. 2018 episode of PBS Newshour (see pbs.org/newshour), Nadine Burk/Burke Harris explained that C.T.S. can cause something like P.T.S.D, which has often been misdiagnosed as A.D.D./ A.D.H.., something that I personally have experienced.
4In Jame Rivers’s theme essay, “Anchored by Immaturity,” he gave us a typical example of someone overreacting to stressors, one after another, until people got hurt and he got sent to prison."

Janie appeared from the back of the house and she looked scared. She told me I probably should go home but the man smiled and told me to stay. The next thing I realized, the man was taking pictures of Janie and me. The young woman began instructing us on what they wanted us to do. We were instructed to fo things to each other no child should ever know how to do. As I lay on top of janie tears were streaming down her face as well as mine. A morbid darkness was engulfing our souls and minds. We were then instructed to get dressed and told that if either of us ever told anyone we would be killed and so would our families. I never knew who the grown-ups were.
At the tender age of ten, I was moved away from Janie with whom I shared a type of love
with like no other person in my life. After arriving in Kansas, I spent many more sleepless nights crying for Janie. I was introduced to marijuana and told that it would make me feel good. It did but there was a major drawback. It made me think about the things I missed doing with Janie. At the age of eleven, I was introduced to cigarettes and alcohol. My young life continued to spiral into a web of darkness I couldn’t escape.
By the time I turned sixteen I met a girl named Karen who was almost a spitting image of Janie. She was fifteen and our parents agreed to let us get married. After three months we had the marriage annulled. I then got caught up in a whirlwind of girls, sex, drugs, cigarettes and alcohol. I had been taught, along with Janie that sex was love and I loved lots of girls. At the age of 24 I met Julia. She didn’t look much like Janie but my heart fluttered when I first looked into her hazel eyes. We married, had two children, then divorced. My world was torn apart to the point of no return. Again, I found love in drugs and alcohol but no girls. For seven years I stayed single. The no-girl-clause I had set for myself only lasted one year. Again, I showed many girls how much I loved them.
Then I met Becky. She favored Janie in a lot of ways and I was determined to marry her. We stayed married for 11 years then got divorced. My third divorce and my fourth destroyed home. I hit rock bottom and allowed drugs to overtake my mind. Soon I felt as though someone else was running my life. I no longer had control over any emotions, my heart became a heart of stone. I no longer feel love or give love.
After three marriages, two children, and twelve grandchildren, I found myself alone and spiraling even deeper into a life of lies and deceptions along with my drugs and alcohol. I spiralled into a world of self-pity and loneliness like I had never known. Ona drug induced stupor I made a mistake that cost me a 35 year sentence behind bars. I felt thwarted to the point that I wanted to die! That night in County Jail I met Jesus Christ and He assured me that if I confessed my sins to the father in heaven, He would forgive me and set me free! I began reading the Bible a Preacher gave me and learning how to become a child of the living God. I’ve been living my life for Jesus and He has turned my heart from stone to flesh. He has taught me how to love the way God loves me.
I have learned to forgive others and show them compassion like my Savior has shown me. When the spirit of God comes into your soul, your moral thoughts will be transformed immediately. You will see sin for what it is, nothing but darkned lies and meaningless deception. You see, Jesus let me out of the darkness into His marvelous light of love and compassion. So to answer the question--am I thwarted or am I set free?-- I can only answer by saying this; God has graciously re-kindled the little light that once became darkness. Jesus Christ has set me free to once more twirl my finger in the air and sing.
“This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine! This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine! This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine! Let it shine! Let it shine! Let it shine!”"

One court victory resulted in an ego-inflation experience. Here, the attorney brought a garnishment action against me, which the judge just quashed at my request, offered me a job immediately following the hearing resulting in his defeat. Not bad for an electronics specialist lacking formal training in law.
Disruptive as the prison experience has been regarding achieving prior life goals, new horizons for personal gratification have presented themselves. The two most important areas relate to endeavors I would never have considered in the “real world”. The realm of primary importance aros when I was hired as a teacher’s aide in the prison’s education department. Over the roughly 6 years that this assignment lasted I was able to assist dozens of my fellow felons obtaining their state mandated functional literacy certificates and to pass their G.E.D. tests.The second domain is creative writing. This ego-centric obsession began with a prisoner constructed curriculum approved by the education department under the guise of adult enrichment. I was hooked! The unit’s monthly newsletter published a few of my short stories and about two dozen of my poems. Other publication credits include poems appearing in “prison living” and “cell door” magazines as well as “prison express” anthologies.
For this dyed in the wool techno-nerd to make the transition from engineering specialist to author/poet is viewed as an accomplishment equal to obtaining a circuit design patent.
Am I better/smart than anyone else? In those areas my talents and experience have been developed; this might well be a correct conclusion. BUT, and that is a “but” in caps and bold print, I am green with envy of many others I have met whose talents and experience lie in areas I have never had the opportunity to explore."

I had gone to school for elementary education with reading and library minors. And at one point we had lived less than 30 miles apart and had gone to a conference in the city where she was currently living. Too strange, huh?
About 5-6 years later, i got a call on my birthday from the International Reunion Soundex Registry who’s paperwork I’d filled out back in college. This organization tries to find matches between adoptees and birth parents (or adopted siblings split up). They had upgraded their computers and found thousands of potential new matches. My birth dad has ironically also been searching the whole time, but had the wrong birth year. The lady from the Soundex Registry said she would look further to see if she could find a phone number or address for him. She called back 2 days later, she had bad news - he was dead - murdered in a 10 year old unsolved mystery. I was able to find news articles online about the murder as well as his obituary. I was able to track down some aunts and uncles. One of whom still writes to me here."

The cat died, and so we buried it beneath the tree that he fell out of, which to my way of thinking, kind of seemed like an insult. I mean to be buried under the very thing that caused your death is akin to the hunters that use the mounted head of a trophy deer as a gun rack. I asked a teacher later on why he thought the cat didn’t land on his feet. The only explanation that he could offer was this: that since the cat was so obese, perhaps he had a heart attack from the exertion of climbing up the tree and that may have been the reason for his fall.

I stopped and smelled the roses, to shamelessly use a cliche. The fragrant spray of the honeysuckles infused my memories with the enchantment of that Summer. Nature’s vivid palette was my muse, the aromatics my inspiration. Life’s vibrant hues became manifest. The pictures taken were imported into my computer to graphically manipulate their flora pixels. It was an impressionable technique conducive to a rich interaction with the bounty of the landscape, by appreciatively exploring the subtle touches of creation. In those moments, the flowers and myself both belonged there together.
“What are you doing picking flowers?” My Uncle Sonny said one day. He was passive aggressive, and was attempting to emasculate me in front of the neighbor. I looked down; I was guilty; I was picking flowers, but I had a good reason. I liked to arrange them artistically in natural-edged wooden bowls that I turned on the lathe. It made me feel connected to the life force of the Summer. Uncle Sonny would never understand. So, I railed into him, full blast, in front of the neighbor.
“Yes, I am picking flowers. Your wife is a master gardener, and we live in a wonderland. Maybe, if you spent time picking flowers instead of being controlling, you wouldn’t be such an asshole.” I stalked off to console my wounded pride, leaving them both speechless.
At the end of the Summer the time came to present my project in art class. I had feathered the edges of the individual blooms, and overlapped the petals in an intricate collage. There were varying degrees of transparency and colors in a complimentary arrangement. I blew it up poster-sized and brought it to the professor. He was not impressed. In fact, he aired me out in front of the shocked class, telling me it was unfinished. The criticism stung. After exchanging words, I stormed out of the class and never came back. The rejection was taken personally. Perhaps I was hyper-sensitive; after all, I had been picking flowers. In the end it was the way he went about it that miffed me. He used his critique as a weapon in our personality conflict. My Aunt Linda, on the other hand, absolutely cherished it. It was the coolest thing ever. She got it. Our connection was evident through the medium. In that sense, beauty truly is in the eye of one who beholds, because that is where the deep, intimate connections are nurtured. There, the subjective perception collides with the creative radiance of the artist and creation itself- sometimes becoming legendary."

God is not a human being who speaks falsely, nor a mortal who feels regret. Is God one to speak and not act, to decree and not bring it to pass? I’m here to tell you that God will give you a helping hand. All it takes is efficacious prayer and unconditional trust. That means trusting him when you don’t understand. God can see things in you that you can’t see in yourself. His plan for your life is bigger than your plan. But God doesn’t take us in a straight line. Part of his plan involves twists, turns, disappointments, losses and bad breaks.
If you have conditional trust you’ll get discouraged and think why is this happening, but God is still directing your steps. Trust him even when it feels as though you’re going in the wrong direction. God has the final say. Right now he is working out his plan for your life. There may be some fiery furnaces. Are you going to trust him only if he delivers you from the fire. I believe with all of my heart that if you trust in him he is faithful to give a helping hand. The longer I live the more I pray God let not my will but your will be done. Let God do it his way. God will not only give the desires of your heart, he’ll do more than you ask or think.

Dogs still barked, hollow and distant in the gray haze, but there was no other sound save the dull drumming of our feet. Nothing gave any hint of the passage of time except the growing ache in legs and back. My hands clenched until I wasn’t sure I could release them, and I wondered if I would ever walk normal again. I glanced back only once more. Shadows in the fog seemed to race behind me, but I couldn’t be certain. The chill and damp soaked through my shirt, soaked into my skin. Only the rush of air past my face and the gather and strain of my legs told me I was moving at all. It must’ve been hours.
“Hold up!” Mark softly called suddenly. “Stop!” I was so startled that I forged ahead, running into Don, before I could stop. Houses loomed in the fog on all sides. We had reached Mark’s destination. He strode forward again. “Follow me and keep quiet.”
Discomfited, I fell into place without complaint as the party moved deeper into the neighborhood. A lone dog, unseen in the cold mist, barked at us furiously, then ran away. Here and there a light appeared in a window as some resident stirred. Other than the dog, no sound save the muted steps of our feet disturbed the night. Mark stopped before a dark house that looked exactly like any other. Fog swirled around Mark like smoke as he strode forward alone, mounting the steps. At the top he hammered on the door. A light appeared in the window of the next house and someone shouted angrily. Mark kept on hammering. Abruptly, the door was flug back by a lady in a skimpy nightgown that barely covered her. A light from further inside illuminated a narrow fence with pointed features.
“What’s this?” She said angrily. “What’s going on?” Chill gray tendrils curled into the doorway, and she hurriedly stepped back. “Come back tomorrow,” she started to turn away. Mark caught her wrist, giving her a hard stare. She opened her mouth to protest; then, recognizing Mark, she licked her lips and stepped further back, letting us in. Chewing her lip, she shifted nervously, peered out at the mist laden night one last time, and closed and locked the door.
We found the help we’d hoped for. We had a chance now."

I narrowly missed a direct hit from another spurting geyser. Still, I caught my left leg with enough pressure to make me spiral forward and land hard on my back. I slowly pulled myself together, and looked up into the climax of this bizarre polar eruption awestruck. Though I was subsequently stricken with unbridled fear by what I witnessed next.
An odd and angular aircraft, about the size of your standard seaplane, gently levitated through the settling chaos. It had a sleek and fluctuating, almost liquid, metal shell. The steam from its underbelly swallowed me, and for a second I thought the vapor would enter my lungs and take my life. However, the mysterious craft just hovered before me; tilting and swaying like a curious creature investigating my unfamiliar presence. It then settled itself and, surprisingly, a crescent-shaped window formed up where I assumed the cockpit to be.
I squinted, as I could barely make out the shadowy figure sitting inside this unknown airborne contraption. Then, streaks of light inside the aircraft sprang to vibrant life, and I instinctively recoiled at the initial view. It… was more or less humanoid in shape, and its upper body appeared very sizeable and strong. Its skin seemed scaly though, much like a fish, and it reflected a polished bronze color in the clear light. It lacked a proper nose or ears or hair; and its mouth seemed painted on in a narrow inexpressive stripe, but its large anime eyeballs glowed through inner lights like the aurora borealis - directly at me.
A few seconds passed, and I heard something like tapping on a microphone, followed by the high-pitched blare of feedback. Suddenly, a spotlight sliced through the arctic air and blanketed me, just as a throaty American voice startled me.
“Greetings, Terrestrial Human Female. You have been of tremendous assistance to me. My ship unexpectedly malfunctioned, many decades ago, and I have been waiting on some form of electrical energy to help jumpstart my systems. I can finally return home now… You have my most impassioned gratitude. Farewell!”
And just as quickly as it had spoken, its aircraft ascended and vanished through the dense clouds into the infinity beyond - leaving me alone in the cold calm. I heard what was left of my equipment reignite with an electrified hum. In silence, I gathered what I could and hiked back out to where I had left my snowmobile. I shakily straddled it, and sped off in the direction of camp seeking something resembling my sanity… and maybe some fresh underwear."

Other areas of social change are not as easy to describe because they deal with changes in attitude. Among these are changes to the family structure and high school rights of passage.
Today the forms of discipline employed by my parents and their contemporaries would result in some form of counseling, possible removal of the child(ren) from the home, or some other penalty up to and including imprisonment. In other words, the family structure has been stood on its head- children now “rule the roost” in defiance of parental wisdom with the blessing and backing of the government.
In keeping with the 1960’s “free love” mentality, getting to “second base” or even “going all the way” during high school years was a right of passage and rarely subject to more than parental intervention and./or the occasional “shotgun wedding.” Now, however, the same conduct results in lengthy prison terms for the “offending” male (it is rare that the willing female participant is prosecuted).
Although I have lived through these and numerous other “social reforms,” I still find it hard to believe how much our society has degenerated over my lifetime. The most disturbing aspect of these realizations is the fact that I did not recognize what was happening as the incremental changes occurred. It is only through this kind of retrospective reflection that I have been able to identify these deplorable developments. Shamefully, by failing to oppose detrimental changes where and when necessary makes me equally responsible for our society’s degradation."

I headed deeper into the woods. I dove over a fallen tree to hide. As I hit the ground I scared a large hare which jumped over the tree and ran, unknowingly, in the direction of the wolves …. I heard them coming. I looked out over the tree and watched as four hungry wolves picked up the scent of the hare and ran by.
After a few moments, I heard the feeding frenzy. I jumped over the tree and followed -- hastily -- my footprints back to my cabin.

Long straight dark hair, just like hers, only shinier. The shape of her face could pass as her sister, only younger. Trim and curvy, only firmer. She approached, his eyes locked on the jiggle of her breasts. There was an air of freedom in her step. Brown eyes, just like hers, only softer, vibrant, sparkling in the sunlight. He locked onto those brown eyes, waiting for them to meet his. She passed without a glance.
At first it was only his eyes that had followed her passing, but when she passed, his eyes dragged his chin around until it banged into his shoulder. He was still holding his fiance’s hand when his chin pushed his shoulder back, hips turning to save his balance, feet sidling so not to stumble. His back was not to his fiance. He whistled.
A moment of echoing silence.
“ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!” Her hand grabbed his lead shoulder, her jaw flopped in disbelief, brown eyes turned into daggers. “Five days until our wedding and you are catcalling?”
Still holding hands, her grip on his shoulder taloned, ripping his attention around to her. She was speechless. He was lost. They stared at one another, his left hand still holding his right hand. Then her right hand wound back. Like a hook from a prize fighter, her anger uncoiled, slapping him soundly across his cheek. She yanked her left hand from his right, ripped the engagement ring from her finger, then tossed it violently into the street. Right on schedule, an impatient bus rolled over the ring.
There were no words spoken. None were needed. She simply stormed off, leaving him standing alone, gulping for words that would never fix the damage done. Her long, shiny dark hair swayed from side to side. Her bounce was angry, her hips sassy. She did not look back. He turned around, looking for the distraction. She was gone, vanished. Was she ever really there?
Another bus rolled over the discarded ring. He waited until it passed. He stepped off the curb, then plucked the ring from the asphalt. The gold was scratched, the mount bent and smashed, the diamond flawless. He glanced after his fiancee, gone, done and gone. He searched for what had distracted him, nothing. He had nothing. He tucked the ring into his pocket as he walked back to the jeweler."

You ‘ole polecat you!” said Maybelle. “Well baby, I guess you better get on up there.” Donnie said as he joined the rest of the crowd in applause. Maybelle walked over to the stage and grasped the band leader’s outstretched hand to step onto the stage.
“Alright sweetness,” said the man, what would you like to hear?” Maybelle asked. “Do you know anything by Miss Billie Holiday?” The bandleader said,
“of course sweetness,” and started up the band.
Now Donnie knew that May had the prettiest voice he had ever heard. He also knew that she was happiest when she was singing. But what Donnie didn’t know was the fact that in the audience that night sat Mr. Bobby Banks- the man who owned and starred in the biggest radio show around. As Maybelle finished singing her song, there wasn't one person in that club not on their feet applauding. Maybelle stepped down off the stage and headed for Donnie, grinning ear to ear. Before she could cross the dance floor, Mr.Bobby Banks was standing in front of her with his hand out to introduce himself.
“Hello there beautiful. My name is Bobby Banks. I own the Bobby Banks radio show and I believe you just may be a star.”
Something ignited inside Donnie when he saw a man stop his girl and talk to her. So he closed the gap, walked around the stranger and put a protective arm around Maybelle. As he planted a kiss on her cheek, Donnie said,
“That was the most May!” Donnie thought to himself, “I don’t like the looks of this clown.”
Almost sensing his thoughts, the man extended his hands once more; this time to Donnie. “Hiya buddy. I was just tellin’ this lovely lady that I would like her to come be on my radio show. The name’s Mr. Banks, but you may call me Bobby.”
Maybelle interjected, “Thank you Mr. Banks, but my pap would have my hide if I even suggested that I wanted to go on the radio.”
“Well honey, said Bobby, I wouldn’t wanna make your good ole pap mad, but does he know that I would pay you twenty dollars to sing on my show?”
“Well no, but I would have to ask him if it was okay.” said Maybelle.
“Fine, fine, said Bobby. Here’s the address to my radio station. Just come on down on wednesday at seven if it’s alright with your pap.” Maybelle took the little piece of paper and looked at it with round eyes as Bobby Banks walked away. Donnie- glad that he was gone- reached for the paper in Maybelle’s hand. “ Here May. I'll hold onto it until you ask pap.” She looked at Donnie with stars in her eyes, and said “ I'm gonna be a star!”
Donnie said,
“ Now wait May...” Maybelle answered,
“Wait nothin’. Donnie James Franklin, you want to marry me don’t you? Well the twenty dollars sure would help pay for it!”
Donnie sputters
“wh.. wh.. Who told you?”
Maybelle placed a hand on Donnie’s cheek lovingly.
“Nobody told me Donnie Dear . I love you and you love me. It was obvious. Well… especially after I found the ring in your coat pocket.”
Then Donnie pulled the ring out of his pocket and dropped to one knee. “May, my beautiful Maybelle, will you marry me?”
Maybelle reached for Donnie’s hand and said,
“Oh Donnie, I have to ask Pap.”"

Again? Jaime!”
“Yeah. Yeah. I know… I already know Slyvia… ¡Ya basta!” Comfortable silence accompanied them the rest of their way home. When they reached the apartment, Jaime’s teeth wouldn’t stop clattering.
“Ay, ¡ahí está mi princesa! Anda, wen aquí mi corazón,” greeted Raúl, their father. Slyvia obliged, kissing the rough stubble on his cheek. Jaime waited in the doorway. Raúl locked glossy eyes with his oldest. One look. ‘He’s drunk,’ thought Jaime. He didn’t enter. Slyvia went off to their room, tears threatening.
“Close the door estupido. Y, ¡metáte aquí!” ordered Raúl. His thick, well-used, good-for-everything, brown leather belt was already half out of his pants’ loops. Raúl asked, “where’s chour chacket mijo?”
The first syllables left Jaime’s lips as the belt whizzed through the air. It's buckle hit him on his jaw’s left side, just above the neck. Pain sizzled. The next one scored his shoulder. Then, his full lips. His jaw again, right side. Jaime curled into a ball. Every lashing punctuated by a curse, “estupido. Malcriado. Hijo de puta. Tonto. Comemierda. Desagradecido.”
In their room, Slyvia sobbed. For the next three days she went to school alone. No one asked about Jaime.
“Jaime?” asked Slyvia, “¿por qué no tienes zapatos?”
Busted lips, he smiled, “el perro de nuestro vecino.”
Slap. “Ouch! Hey, that hurts stupid!” cried Jaime. Slyvia crossed her arms, glaring. It was 26 degrees.
“Not as stupid as you. The dog? Again? Jaime, just tell dad they got stolen or something, please!” begged Slyvia, carefully outlining five day old cuts on his face.
“He only does it when he’s drunk.”
“He’s always drunk.”
Jaime’s head drooped, “I know…”
Slap. “Pendejo!” Punch. “Cabrón! Desagradecido.” Jaime fell to the floor. Fresh blood coloring his new, tan coat. It was a few more kicks later when he passed out. He awoke, his head in Slyvia’s lap, her singing “Te Busco,” by Celía Cruz; their mother’s favorite. Tears fell on his face. Jaime went back to sleep.
The next day.
“I no work all f--ing damned day por nada. Chou idiot! How yous lose everything?! Huh?” Raúl was too drunk to finish. An inspired kick. He stumbled away. ‘Thank God for small favors,’ thought Jaime.
Slyvia was vexed. If her brother wasn’t missing clothes, shoes, or his backpack, entirely. He didn’t have his lunch bag, or all of the above. She knew he wasn’t forgetful. He didn’t get picked on by anyone, save their dad. She just couldn’t figure it out. She’d ask. He’d smile, say the same old thing, “the neighbor’s dog,” the “, I know.” He’d come home, get beat and never cry or say anything. ‘Someday,’ thought Slyvia, ‘he’s really going to get hurt.’
“Someday,” was a month later. A serious concussion, cracked ribs and collar bone.
The hospital wasn’t far from their apartment. On the weekends she smuggled him in sofrito, black beans and rice - moros y cristianos. She wasn’t his only visitor. No worries, detective Slyvia was on the case. Two and a half weeks later, she found her man, New Jersey Devils’ hat, tan jacket, black and red nikes, Raphael, the ninja turtle, backpack; all her brother’s. She followed the culprit home. In a surprise attack, she knocked him to the ground, just inside his apartment doorway.
“Myri!” screamed two hand-me-down-clad children. They swarmed to protect Myriam. The oldest, no more than five, said, “hey, meanie! You leave my sister alone.”
Myriam lay sprawled behind her tiny defenders, terrified, embarrassed.
“Qué chingada?” cursed Slyvia, bewildered. Four hours later, Myriam and Slyvia said goodbye. Myriam said “please don’t tell him.”
“I promise, Myri. I’ll never say anything.”
“He talks about you so much Slyvie. Thank you. I don’t know what we’d do without him…”
Jaime’d left the hospital that day, alone. He was home when Slyvia returned, “where the hell have you been all dam-”
Slyvia ran to the couch and onto his lap. “Ouch, stupid! I’m still hurt dummy!”
Smooch!
“What was that for weirdo?”
“Because, I have the most awesomest, dumb brother alive…”"

Planes roaming way up in the blue flying along puffs of marshmallows. Living in this endless winter, alive only in visions of things that never occurred. Oh, how many lives I’d have lived in a different way. So, so very few, the remembrances of moments that went well, or that I wouldn’t change if I could. Brief respites, hidden, secret, wholesome memories of long forgotten days of lore.
Drowned in the icy abyss of dark cool tossing waves below a never ending depth of drenching salty freezing tears. Horror threatens, swimming near, out of translucent shadow shades of seam pushing along a current, snapping jaws of rows of razor teeth, cutting, puncturing the flesh of spirit, bleeding out strands of odious contempt. Drowned beneath the surface of ever tossing, turning undertows of brilliant crashing waves.
Then something deep and dark in late, late night, a vision, a dream, a memory returns of the wide eyed full and crushing uproarious laughter of my own little child. She would shout in gleeful chuckles, scream in joyful giggles, and I hope she may never lose her smile. As we grow, we might forget our own lone laughter while that of others brings a sigh. Perhaps only a child knows true laughter, but in a crooked old wrinkled and withered smile, there’s something only age can teach us to laugh about."

The girl braided Safayah’s hair, decorating it with moonstones that dangled over her forehead. The old women adorned Safayah’s fingers with gemstoned rings and slipped various precious-metaled bracelets on her wrists— one dangling a small key like a charm. They attached a priceless ceremonial torc around her neck. Lastly, the old woman slipped gilded sandals onto her feet, the girl affixed a gown-matching headdress. “Now you look like a princess,” the girl said breathlessly. Safayah glanced at her image in the cheval glass. She felt goosebumps pebble her body.
After the servants departed Safayah’s mother entered, admired her daughter, and escorted her out of the house. Proudly displaying her daughter to the cheering crowd that awaited, Safayah’s mother paraded her daughter through the streets to the Shrine of Deliverance where the ceremony was held. The proud mother reveled in this signal accomplishment of Safayah’s. Her family would rise in rank this day.
The sun was setting as they arrived at the Deliverance, the sky blazed with mystery. The Shrine of Deliverance is a simple courtyard for worshippers with an altar at the western edge. A priest in amethyst robes stands at the altar. Nobody else is inside the Deliverance. The courtyard is surrounded by hundreds though. Safayah kisses and hugs her mother— clinging desperately for a moment— then walks to the altar. Bowing, the priest hands Safayah a lit and an unlit candle. She bows in return, lights the unlit candle, sets it on the altar, extinguishes the priest’s lit candle, and disguards it. Kneeling a short distance from the altar, Safayah steeples her hands, bows her head, closes her eyes, and prays.
He joins her at the altar. A severe-looking young man in ceremonial warrior-priest dress, a long sword hanging sheathed at his side. He stops slightly behind and to the left of Safayah. Without looking at her he sets his feet, left hand resting on his sword-hilt, his eyes straight ahead into the setting sun.
The priest takes an ornate chest from the altar and sets it reverently in front of Safayah then returns to this former place. Opening her eyes, Safayah pulls the chest closer and takes the key dangling from her wrist, opening the chest. A small vial of clear liquid is inside. Taking it out she kisses it, pulls the stopper loose, and kissing it, sets it inside the chest.
The priest speaks for the first time: “This solemn ceremony is dedicated to our fertility god, Zoridyah. We gather at this time that symbolizes an ending. This wedding ceremony solemnizes a new beginning— with this sacrifice of life, for life.”
Looking closely at the two figures in front of him he asks, “Do you willingly enter this joining?”
“I do!” Safayah answers loudly, quickly drinking the liquid from the vial.
“It is done,” the priest says. “You are now married to our Lord, Zoridyah.”
With these words the young warrior-priest unsheaths his sword, brings it up over his right shoulder, his right leg stepping back a pace, and with a soft grunt he swiftly sweeps his sword down and through Safayah’s tender-fleshed neck.
Safayah’s head falls to the ground with a dull thud rolling a couple feet into the side of the chest. It stops with her beautiful, smiling face illumined by the last glint of the setting mystery.
The crowd cheers!"

I developed a specific intention, with this breath I choose peace, with this breath I choose freedom. I learned how to meditate. Taking the Siddha Meditation program, also offered nation-wide in prisons, provided a lot of information on how to do this. Guru Maya taught me to chant “Om Namah Shivaya” and how to find the still spaces inside of me. This led to meditative walking, as there is a track here. Sometimes I can spend an entire afternoon walking. Not talking to another, not listening to the radio. Just walking. It takes three miles to clear my mind.
Reading books, uplifting novels and genuine life stories, both helped and entertained me. Reading these helped me to empathize with characters and place myself in their shoes. Soon I began to have empathy for others. I got a job as a law clerk helping people with their cases, and was assigned to be the legal aide in the SHU. Helping people who are in a worse situation than yourself keeps you humble and mindful.
I also became a part of the Alternatives to Violence Community. This is a program I have worked within for years. Learning how to tap into the Transforming Power is life changing. Using tools of Expecting the Best, Respecting Yourself, Caring for Others, Thinking Before Reacting, and Asking for a Non-Violent Solution. For years I’ve been working on the exercises in the AVP manual with the other facilitators. Some of whom are completely annoying and obnoxious, still I work the exercises.
The opportunity to practice these ideas in my daily life has changed me on a fundamental level.I’ve learned how to actively listen, how to place myself in someone else’s shoes, and how to release my anger in a non-violent way. My anger has slowly dissipated.
Sometimes the loneliness and isolation of prison becomes too much. Cruelty is not a personality trait, it’s a habit. I started feeding the cats and luring them to lie in my lap where I would comb and pet them. Their purring is hypnotic. Petting soft creatures makes your heart rate go down and lowers your blood pressure. I volunteer to babysit dogs, Golden Retrievers and Labs, from the service dog program. Lying in a field of grass and being licked by dogs on your palms and the soles of your feet is infinitely more enjoyable than the Old Testament would lead you to believe. Throwing the ball is therapeutic. Feeding the ducks and their ducklings is also soothing. They are like an adoring fan club and it’s funny to see them run waddling on webbed feet running to a bread crumb fest. Animals are always happy to see you.
Lastly, I started writing. There have been two writing programs here Artspring and Exchange4change. But Prisoner Express was the first program I started with. Prisoner Express is still one of the most important parts of my life. I usually stick to creative non-fiction about my life. The writing prompts are therapeutic and help me to put the past in perspective. Writing is an exercise in which you, the writer, want to be known and to tell your story. It creates emotional intimacy with other people. The readers of Prisoner Express may know more about me than many of my friends and family. And I feel I know some of them in the same way. I enjoy reading the essays. Every time a packet comes, I stay up late in the night reading. I feel like I am part of a community that is helping me to become a better writer. But again that is what happens when you write. You become known to others. No matter how impersonal you try to make your writing the truth about yourself leaks out around the edges. Being a part of this community, writing about both the pain and the farce of my existence brings calm.
And on that note I would like to thank the two gentlemen who complimented my writing/ Also, in no particular order, a short list of writers I have enjoyed reading but by no means the whole list. Thank you Mr. Matthew Tomlinson for your amusing story No Grace, but did you have to kill Midnight, the dog? Thank you to Ms. Shannon Guess Richardson for your brave story about pregnancy in prison. Thank you to Ms. Kwaneta Harris for your amazing Brown Baby story from 2016. And last thank you to J. Bauhaus for your biker stories, to Bobby Bunderson for his Toy story and to Cesar Hernandez for your many flash pieces, my favorite of which is an older one about the meaning of Security that I have taped to my locker lid. Thanks to all the many other writers whom I have enjoyed and still enjoy reading. I am honored to be included in the anthologies with you."

Unless I’m in an experimental mood, I usually begin with action. Some conflict, collision, or problem: a woman screaming, persons arguing, etc. It grabs the reader, but it’ll also grab you. This is what I call “writing like a reader.” I allow the story to carry me however it appears in my head. From the Big Bang to the conclusion. I’ll write, describing the scenes as I imagine them. Then I’ll go over it several times because the initial story is normally quite terrible.
A process of toning and building my muscle (redrafting) is essential. During this process I’ll apply what I learned by reading like a writer. Dialogue, scenery, character development, plot, twists and turns, pace, flow, and sense of purpose. After it becomes readable, I distance myself. I need to read my story with fresh “reader” eyes. Another round of toning and building and then I’ll send it to some unsuspecting victim: my advance reader. If my advanced reader responds awe-struck then, I know I have a story ready for polishing before I start submissions. If not, well… I’ll go back over it, eventually…
But such is my formula for creating stories. After I’ve got a skeleton I’ll cover it in skin, slap on muscle and connective tissues. Give it some vital organs, never forget its heart. Send my body to the gym. Slim down here, bulk up there, get quicker, or move slower, etc. Check results: awe-inspiring or not?
If not, it’s back to the gym. If yes, then it’s shower time. Your work’s done for the moment."

The cops a-looking for you. You better hide, the shadow on the railroad is near.”
I start to run as fast as I can and I don’t know why. But I start running for the woods near the railroad. This is not happening to me I think, as something from behind me starts to grab my shoulder. I feel an icy touch, and I smell a foul odor behind me. I glance back to see the cloaked figure is right behind me. I run as fast as I can and the closer I get to the woods, the clearer the song is to me. “...The shadow on the railroad is near. The cops a-trying to silence you. The shadow on the railroad welcomes you.”
I definitely did not want to hear that, I think. Then I hear a very clear order to run into the mist to fight off the cops.
I begin to shut my eyes, and I see another vision. I see the grove of trees I was walking in the other day and I see a mist that a shadow is pointing at. I begin to sprint as fast as I can towards the grove of trees that has been my safe spot since childhood. Since the time I saw little Jimmy fall off the shed on the hill near the railroad tracks. I was blamed for it, but I knew I saw a shadow. Now I see the cloaked figure pushed Jimmy that day.
I hear the song so clearly now. “...The shadow on the railroad is near the mist. Run into the mist to be one with the shadow on the railroad. When the shadow on the railroad is near, murder by cops is held at bay.”
I now run into the mist and I hear “Cops are cancer of people's shadows and you are now one with the shadow of the railroad.”
That was 2 days ago and now I’m in a town about 50 miles away. I am listening to the song of the shadow realm. It calls me to a little girl. I see her with her mother. “But Mommy, I didn’t push Mark off the bridge that is by the railroad tracks,” the little girl says.
I look around and I see at least 20 cops all waiting for me to leave. The girl’s mother leaves her. The girl whispers to the shadows, “Hurt Mark!” The cops glare at her. I sing my song.
“...The shadow on the railroad is near. Cops know who you are. Don’t run for I hold them at bay. The shadow on the railroad is near. Don’t run girl, for murderous cops are near, and this town needs you.”"

It’s not until we’re deep into them that our true nature and convictions come to light. What are your convictions? What are the standards and principles that you feel so strongly about that you would refuse to comprise?
I had some for a lot of years that I thought were rock solid. Life is ironic at times. What I thought were convictions were simply ideas that “felt good” to talk about, but that I just couldn’t uphold. I wilted in the face of something temporary and unfulfilling. I found out years later that a true conviction costs you something. It costs you the illusion of pleasure without consequence.
There is something that you gain to replace that. It’s called true conviction without compromise. That brings self respect, true respect from others… even those who may not agree with you - they can respect your lack of compromise.
Oh, you’ll probably lose some folks along the way as well. You’ll find that once you develop some convictions that those without them will drift out of your life or you’ll drift out of theirs. Those who have real convictions will eventually display them and those without won’t feel comfortable when they’re around at that time.
I recommend that everyone examine themselves and develop some real convictions. The younger you are, the better because they’ll come in handy to guide you through the rest of your life."

I felt sad for them. Healing is slow but I’m learning the art of patience. For me, writing has been instrumental in processing all these emotions and reconsidering my initial goals to retrieve my stuff and for them to be jailed.
I found the reward for me to be in the entire forgiving process, and they have lost me as a friend, I was stricken from the courtroom, Juvenile and Domestic, because the girl and I had lived together in the previous 2 months prior, so I wasn’t even allowed to watch the case after giving my own testimony, which they allowed for about 5 minutes. The bottom line is I’m in an orange jail suit so nothing I do, did, or said meant anything. They whisked me out, my handcuffed hand trying to hold all the pictures and letters of confessions, evidence spilling all on the floor. Having to get on my knees in front of everyone, shackled and handcuffed - gathering my months of preparation, was the most humiliating indignity of my life.
So when I began to write about the picture of the blimp for this project, my first impulse was to write about the horrible May 6, 1937 Crash of the Hidenburg and the deaths of 36 people, but I decided to wait and began to wonder why I was so hesitant to tell what I know about the theories of why it crashed, who is to blame, etc. I thought maybe it was a subconscious reason because of my dad being a pilot and my mom a flight attendant earlier in life, and my fears of airline crashes.
But I’ve come to believe, or what I’m choosing to see in this picture is not a tragedy at all. It is an image of hope and serenity. Of the amazing progress man has made in aviation not only through incredible accomplishments in the field of aerodynamics, but also the simple physics concept of heated air.
By re-examining our initial goals, or feelings as they relate to situations, images, or anything really. We can choose to be patient and consider our current mindset, emotions before we act on impulse.

American women in the 1800’s wore brooches and necklaces made with the hair of the deceased loved ones. Long hair in prison is a sign of a woman's wealth because she has to purchase the shampoo, conditioner, hair food, gel, and other products to care for it. These things do not come freely.
Paul the Apostle states in Corinthians, “But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her.” Many religious communities urge women to cover the hair. Kimhit, of the Talmud, bore seven sons who became high priests, and attributed her blessing to the fact that even the walls of her house had never been exposed to a lock of her hair. Hair seduces. Every representation of the Goddess Venus has long hair. The Muslims say that for every strand of hair a woman reveals she will suffer that many days in hell.
The Catholic church declared Joan of Arc a witch for cutting her hair. The Muslims say the hair of a slave if that slave is raped by the master. Long Hair, small intelligence, say the Turks. In World War II, Mussolini declared war on bobbed hair. Frenchwomen accused of sex with Nazi invaders were punished by having their heads shaved in public. A clipping of Princess Diana’s hair sold for $10.00 on eBay.
According to a Japanese proverb Hair is a woman’s life.
In the blink of an eye, I find myself speechless when the doctor tells me my scheduled surgery requires me to have all of my hair shaved off."

A white-tailed doe or buck pranced its way in front of us to duck out of sight. But the ultimate experience was to get a glimpse of a grizzly. Its massive bulk showing its claws leaves an unforgettable memory etched in your brain. Just to see its track sends a shiver down my back. A true killing machine.
The ride to my uncle Bill’s house in Longview seemed shorter than usual. There were no animals in sight. No glowing eyes in our headlights. Not even a bird in the sky. It was strange not to see even a doe or a cub on the roam. No one paid any mind to its silence. All I had on my mind was how many crawdads I could pull out of the creek and who would find its wet bottom floor first.
Before long, we pulled into the dirt drive of what was my great grandfather’s house.When we crossed over the bridge the creek flow showed its white waters as I remembered it. I couldn’t wait to jump in! But the work had to get done first. We were the first to arrive and the jeep needed unloading…
Auntie and Grandma were tending the morning chores. Grandpa and Uncle were at the jeep with its hood up attempting motor maintenance, discussing an afternoon at Spirit Lake, and I was at the creek as life began to settle down. It was there where she appeared in my morning views…
Softly with the sweetest tone of the songbirds tongue, she sang her tone with joyful tempo. She brings melody to all who listens before a new morning’s dawn strikes into the distance. She sings long stunning notes with a radiance that stimulates the senses inside the mind and soul.
Dawn begins to appear. The gleam of the sun’s ray sneaks a peek over the mountain’s crest lighting its path in every direction as I stare on. Its alluring sight slowly moves forward while the evening’s morning darkness starts to pass away. The blends of reds and purples spread the new day of glory upon us all. For just a moment, she shouts a beauty of elegance that sparks song and dance. Nature awakes its inhabitants.
She hops from branch to branch in a tall pine reaching the sight she seeks. The breeze shivers its branches and carries the tune of the songbirds' tone to a deeper whisper of delight while the sunrise matures. And she sings her song without flaw.
Quietly the grizzly yawns with a stretch then step out into the forests open air in search of pondering toward the flowing river. The trout treads its waters feeding off of its catch while the squirrel gathers its find. Soaring above comes the hunt of the hawk providing meat for her younglings, and Bobbie the cat, is on her prowl ready to pounce on her prey. Still, she sings her song with utter perfection…
An aroma of the bean strengthens as the sizzle of crimping pork pops out of its pan. The cracking of the egg and the rising of the cakes blends together to make a beautiful morning rise complete.
All at once, everything went silent. Her song stopped and she disappeared. The brush of the breeze stood still the sound of the creek’s water lost its lure like we were in the eye of the storm. And with a shake of the earthquake came a scream from inside the house. “THE MOUNTAIN!!”
I look toward the house when the loudest explosion I have ever experienced pierced our drums. Frightful disbelief of terror filled the hearts of us all in deep sadness. We scurried to the jeep and as I looked on a mushroom cloud above us filled the blue sky and filtered out the beautiful morning's colors. Lightening with gray clouds covered its blue and thunder growled with every flash.
It was 8:32 am on May 18th in 1980 that Mount Saint Helens erupted for the first time in 120 years. Its eruption was preceded by two magnitudes 5 Earthquakes. Over 60 people were killed, a widespread flooding and mudslides occurred from the ash and melted snow which included our family's home and properties. The surrounding forests were scorched, scattered and devastated. Washington and her surrounding states were blanketed with ash and panic as far as Montana as the nation watched on.
Our breakfast on this day would not be forgotten as the mountain’s eruption interrupted a nation’s morning with vast destruction of floodwaters, ash, panic that would affect the earth and its inhabitants for many years to come."

Kav popped the question to his partner and Kav has done all the planning. The event is taking place in a tiny chapel way up in the mountains of Colorado. Kav and El moved there shortly after I came to prison. Unlike the big royal wedding, the chapel only seats twenty-five people. It’s a forty minute hike up the side of the mountain. For most of the year there is some snow on the ground. The wedding guests will be wearing Patagonia and North Face, no fascinators will be in evidence. Although I think my friend may put some pink streaks in her hair. Kav sings with the Denver Gay Men’s Chorus, and a small quartet will provide vocal music along with a solo violin.
Sadly I will not be attending the little gay wedding but I expect it to be just a fairytale, because these two love birds, surrounded by the friends and family who care about them and accept them, can marry and pursue a dream of marital happiness just like Meghan and Harry."

Flowers are for people.
The Lee Correctional Massacre just may be a flower in disguise- perhaps now, with so much national attention, prison conditions and sentencing will change.
No, we don’t think much of flowers. But that’s only because our state only sees us as what they call us- “inmates”- with numbers assigned that they can add to their collective for claiming their “share” of the tax jar. It’s all about the budget- rehabilitation or empathetic sentencing costs money and effort- it’s about what’s cost effective to the status quo.

“Well Jace, do you know the difference between lust and greed?”
“I have an idea, but no, I don’t know.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

""Then you think it's stupid.""
She fought the urge to throw sand in his face. ""Let's just say I’m trying to understand the purpose of an island that's barely offshore.""
""It's a demo,"" Bill said, relaxing."" Think of it in the same way that a builder will display houses. Interested buyers can tour them.""
Lisa regarded the island. The ugly block-shaped building, the scraggly trees, the pointless little steps running inside what she assumed to be breakwaters. It looked like something child with a bucket, shovel, and a few sticks might build on a beach. ""I guess I still don't get the desire for an island located on the shore.""
""The demo is on the shore. We will build the island wherever they want it.""
""Does it float?""
""No.""
""Then how do you build it in deeper water?""
Bill shrugged, ""I'm still working that out.""
Making his way up to the block building, Bill leaned against and continued, ""It's like that old saying 'every man needs an island.' Well, now they have one.""
Lisa joined him on the island, but sat in the shade of one of the trees. Looking out over the horizon, she admitted to herself that she felt relaxed. They she looked over her shoulder toward her husband only a few short feet away, the scraggly scrub of vegetation fighting to gain a foothold in the sandy soil, and that awful looking block building; and reality came crashing back. ""I believe the saying is more like 'every man is an island; and I'm starting to think that once you go deeper you find it's barren.""
""Ha ha, very funny Lisa,"" Bill came over and sat beside her.
She smiled disarmingly at him "" I thought it was. Seriously though, what about food and water?""
Bill beamed,"" I'm glad you asked. Let's see if it works."" He stood, brushed the sand from his jeans and reached toward her.
Clasping his hand, she allowed him to help her up. ""See if that works, bill?""
Producing a remote, Bill pushed a button.
Somewhere inside the island, a low hum began. Lisa sensed a slight vibration emanating from the ground. ""Umm…Bill?""
He walked to the front of the building and looked down at a square block opening directly in front of the block building. ""The island in built around a desalinate. Fresh water will come out just above the well,"" Bill said pointing to the square block opening, ""flow into it, and after filling it drains by the spillway where it returns to the ocean. I plan to use the system to help cool storage for food.""
""So where is the water?""
""I don't know.""
Just then, water spilled from the block building behind Bill, soaking his jeans and almost knocking him into the well. He scrambled away and stared dumbfounded at the rushing water.
Lisa laughed.
""Not funny Lisa.""
""It's absolutely hilarious, Bill.""
He kicked at the ground. ""Now what am I supposed to do!""
Lisa watched the water cascading from the building. After a few moments she said, ""Well, I suppose you could put a slide on it.""
Bill stopped and stared at her. His inscrutable look made her nervous. Suddenly he grabbed her in a strong bear-hug, lifted her from the ground, and spun her around. ""That's it!"" he said.
""What's it?""
""Water parks! We can market it to waterparks! Lisa, you are a genius. Heck, maybe we can design our own water park.""
""Ok, put me down now.""
He set her down, and she reached up and tousled his hair. ""Being your wife is never boring.""

Then the phone went silent. She could be my last hope. It was Friday the 13th. In no way am I superstitious, after hearing all the negative people who believe. One has to think outside the box.
Monday morning I got up and had a coke and a honeybun. Not much of a breakfast, money was tight, my savings were getting low. Once it is all gone, I’d be out on the street or on my way back home as a failure.
Sitting on the window box looking over the city, I was wondering how many others had the same problem. They would have to leave everything behind and return to the places they had come from. How many kids were involved with their choices?
My heart had become heavy and I sure didn’t want to return home. I wanted more to prove to myself and others this was my dream. I would love to have my life to be fulfilled with all I have ever wanted.
I was watching the clouds float by. They reminded me of cotton balls. They were so close you just wanted to reach out and grab one. The constant noise of sirens traveled up to the seventh floor. The building had a total of twenty-two floors. Not included in this was the penthouse. It was owned by a couple, I had never seen before. They had their own private elevator.
The phone rang, it was on its third ring by the time I held the receiver. “Hello,” I said. It was Anita. “Wanda, I have good news for you,” she said. I listened as she told me about the new job. “My boss is willing to hire you as an intern, you will start this Thursday.” “What will I wear to the job?” I asked. “Come by to the office and I will have a voucher for you to pick up some clothes.” “Ok, I will be there within the hour. I hung up the phone feeling secure this was going to be my home.
It has been two years now since Anita helped me get the job with this law firm. So far I have worked my way up the ladder as they call it. This woman has left the internship behind and has studied real hard for the paralegal course. I passed the exam for it and will be working on getting my law degree soon. It takes a little effort to get things done in life you don’t give up. Believing in yourself and putting time into it will always be rewarding in the end.
Now that Hamilton, Snyder, and Associates believe in me, I could very well see my name on the door also. This is one of the largest law firms in the state.
I really can say that I have a place of my own, closet full of clothes, shoes, bills paid, and money in savings. Most of all, this is my last move."

Her name was GillyAnne. She thanked him for saving her and apologized for assuming the worst of his intentions. They talked the entire way, without any awkward pauses, about their families and their personal thoughts and desires. As they drew near her home, she told him to stop and leave her right there.
“I dare not risk your tail,” she explained. “For my brood is loathe to understand. I shall cry out once you have departed safely and surely, my sisters, they worry and will make their way to retrieve me.”
Roman paused, gazed into the soft onyx of her eyes and asked: “And when will I be blessed to see you again?”
They agreed to meet in three days, in the apple orchard near the old man’s farm. It was well beyond picking season, and it was far enough that no one they knew would see them. The smiling fox bid adieu and was off into the woods.
On the day Roman was set to meet GillyAnne, he carefully groomed his fur and hurried off to the apple orchard. GillyAnne was there, smiling and awaiting beneath the shade of a tree on a warm, sunny day. He wanted to kiss her. She wanted to kiss him. When they embraced she could feel his heart beating quickly against her chest. For the past three days, all she could think about was how his presence made her feel so complete. When they finally kissed she felt like she was flying as high as she’s ever flown before. Without a word, they stood there for a moment, over-blissed, staring into each-other’s eyes.
Just then, a dog barking close by interrupted their elation. Roman turned to see the old farmer’s son aiming a rifle at him. A shot. GillyAnne pushed Roman out of the way. The virgin white feathers of her bosom flooded red from her own blood. She collapses. Another shot. It hits the tree bark to the right of Roman’s head. Roman snarls and runs towards him, as he draws near he jumps at the old farmer’s son. The final shot. It pierces Roman’s chest, throwing him back on the ground. A day later, in the apple orchard, it was a curious owl who spotted the lifeless bodies of a goose and a fox peacefully huddled together."

American by way of slave trade, revolutionary both in concept and conception, mentally and by way of actions. On this journey to regain knowledge of self and my original culture which is I- God culture. My most ancient and contemporary identity is one and the same, god of all creations. Thankful that my skin is original again, that my attraction for my luscious lipped, curvaceous muse and intelligent goddess counterpart is still my sisters, moors of all mothers wombs. Speaking to skintones from charcoal black to the lighterst gold all who were created independent and strong. Conscience of original beauty being their own nature. This is the reason why stranger tan, where make-up made with colors, pay for botox to fatten lips, hips, and shapely buttocks. All the while misleading the true goddesses of their intentions of being grafter back to original beings. They’ve got no virtue and history knows the meaning of virgin being All Natural. If you don’t believe me then ponder the meaning of virgin olive oil or virgin hair and you too will see that the only true virgins are my Black Madonna’s Auset who successfully reincarnates as mother, sister, lover, and motivating force of change in stages and degrees…

Of course I’ll cry, mourn over loss. Proper respect demands it of all human beings. I’ll rail against wrongs - curse my dying body for breaking down. For I’m a mere mortal, who has foibles, flaws and emotions same as the 7 billion other living beings on earth. It’s what is done “afterwards” that means the most.
If we all prepare ourselves to endure the tragedies and sufferings we know to expect in the blink of an eye; then we shall recover quickly and be a better human for it. Moreso, if we take the time to just be there for others, even strangers, we sense such losses have consumed them; we will quickly learn how precious such agape love is. Just offer an ear to listen to those who hurt. Offer your own experiences and what you did to overcome the same sorrows. Let me tell you firsthand - our Creator has infused us all with special hormones called endorphins. When we give unselfishly of ourselves to comfort another, we will feel a priceless euphoria from our endorphins which is so much more powerful a euphoria than any/all drugs ever to exist. It’s priceless - it’s free - and it’s a noble addiction to acquire.
Altruism is the center of most religions. Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism, has altruism as the highest level of perfection a soul may attain. These attributes I have barely scratched the surface of above - if you adopt them - will make us all better beings for it. People worthy to be welcomed to the eternal spirit form when we die, and are reborn - released from the physical plane to the spiritual realms.
Wish I had the words to better help you internalize these pearls of wisdom I learned by personal suffering. But I am but a mere human, mortal and flawed as all of you.
The act of trying your best is all the Creator ever asks. So please today, try to share yourself with others. To learn and to teach how to prepare for major tragedies in the blink of an eye shall fall upon us all. Learn to endure with a cheerful heart. With Deepest Agape Love, Respect, Honor, Sincerely Yours, Tommy Hightower"

An example is the university dorm out west; a six-story building blew up when things didn’t work. A personal account where this could have happened was had here a few months ago.
The booster heater had been on the fritz, so we replaced it. We rebuild the entire unit and replace everything but the tank and circuit board. The refurbished unit should last about 18 months. The replacement lasted a week, and it only came to our attention because I was in the servery working on something else and a worker mentioned a burning plastic smell coming from “that box over there.” When I opened it up I immediately saw the burned wires. The same wires burned as the one we replaced. Strange. Coincidence? Unlikely, but maybe. Instead of replacing the entire unit I decided to replace the heating element.
What I found was the element had exploded inside the tank, but instead of drawing enough power to trip the breaker, the stubs continued to get power and electrolyzing the water into hydrogen and oxygen. All it needed was to sit for a while without flushing new water into the system and the gases would’ve pushed the water level of the tank down for enough for it to expose the element stubs and spark...BOOM!
That was an almost-catastrophe caught because someone smelled a whiff of burning plastic. These ubiquitous, innocuous machines are only safe when working correctly, when well maintained. Please, please, PLEASE! If a machine is broken, sloppy, smells bad, get someone to look at it. Ask questions. Make noise before the noises are screams of pain from shrapnel ripping through your face."

As I listened to their words, tears of joy streamed down my face that a one such as I would be blessed by the Lord God.
In perfect unity, the multitude said, “Glory to El Shaddai, glory in the highest, and peace on earth, goodwill toward men.”
After the angels were gone back into heaven, my companions and I stood for a while until our spirits prompted us to go to Bethlehem to see this thing which the Lord had made manifested to usward.
So we left in haste, and it came to pass, that we found as it had been told unto us, a man and his wife holed up in an animal stall, with the babe sleeping soundly in the manger.
We learned from his parents that our meeting with the angels and his being conceived in an animal stable wasn’t the only miraculous thing surrounding his birth.
For one thing, we discovered that Joseph was not the flesh and blood father of the child and that he was considering putting Mary away from him privily when he found out that she was with child until an angel of the Lord manifested himself to Joseph in a dream, telling him to not fear to take unto him Mary as his wife: “for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.”
And then Mary spoke unto us of how the angel, Gabriel, visited her to give her words of encouragement and comfort in her distress.
They also disclosed unto us that the angel which appeared unto them had told them that the boy’s name was to be Jesus, which is Yeshua in the Hebrew tongue, for he would save his people from their sin.
Upon hearing this, my companions and I dropped to our knees in adoration to God. Our cries of worship woke the lad from his nap and we quickly rose to our feet to look into the eyes of the newborn king.
Mary lovingly lifted the child into her arms, showing unto us his delicate body. I was stricken with awe as I looked upon the tiny hands and feet of the One who would one day change the world.
Joseph stood proudly next to his wife, telling us one other detail that the angel revealed unto him. The birth of this child was a fulfillment of prophecy which Isaiah wrote about, that a virgin would bring forth a son, and that he would be called Emmanuel.
My mouth was agape as the meaning of that name dawned on me: “God with us.” My spirit stirred with me. Would the Maker of the Universe become flesh and dwell among men? Would God himself put on skin and bone to deliver his chosen people from iniquity? Absolutely not! That sounded too absurd… But, then again, nothing is impossible with God.
I again looked to the child’s small form. Could those hands be God’s hands? Could those feet belong to the Master?
Soon afterwards, my companions and I headed out, going back to the field where we left our flock, and all the while we glorified and praised God for all that he had shown unto us.
All I can think of as I write this account down for others to read is the humble approach that the Lord chose to enter the earth; not as a rich king, though he is king, but through poverty, he intends to bring riches to his people. What a God we serve! I have been humbled by this experience and I pray that others are too after reading this. May God’s grace and peace be with you all. Amen."

One may ask then, well am I following the law? I’m a young drug user who sells vast amounts of it in order to support my own habit, so no, not particularly.
I had only left my house for a quick ride to the store to make it look like I picked up some cake. I didn’t want David, the downstairs neighbor to know I was holding. I could go out, come back with his product, and then not only will he share his purchase with me, but I’ll make money too.
Detective West was sitting waiting on me. Almost like this was a set up. Well, fuck it I’m a be polite, direct and to the point, but I’m not putting the car in park. I kept my foot on the brake the entire time, waiting for another high speed chase.
All the while, knowing my brake lights were never extinguished, Detective West kept asking questions. I handed my license over, knowing I was clean there, he asked me in a misleading way, “do you mind if I search the car for anything illegal?” Just like the counselor warned me they would.
“No sir.” I replied as Detective West took it upon himself to open my door. I quickly closed it back and restated, “I said no sir, you can not search my vehicle.”
“What are you afraid I’m going to find?” Detective West resumed asking me again.
“Nothing sir, I just know my rights and I want them followed.” I stated calmly. I know my rights, thankfully to that officer in that juvenile bootcamp. Here I am, sitting with about a half ounce of cocaine on me, and a half ounce of free base, a scale and at least one pipe. Nope, I’m not worried and my foot wasn’t leaving the brake pedal. Luckily it was dark so he couldn’t see my knee steadily shake. I just couldn’t keep it still, my nerves wouldn’t allow me to.
“Okay, I’ll be right back,” Detective West stated as he took my license back to his car. He stayed there for at least twenty-five minutes. Ah, he’s calling back up and they’re going to beat my ass again. It’s all I could reasonably assume, why I would not take my foot off of the brake to put the car in park.
After that long drawn out wait, Detective West walked back up and handed me my license and told me to have a good night. He had no idea what a good night I was already having. No speeding ticket, because it wasn’t a speed trap. He followed me to and from my destination waiting for me to give him a reason to arrest me. I had enough cake on me to last about three days until I needed to re-up again, if I didn’t sell anymore. I shut everything down and stayed home for the next three days"

“You weren’t worried about being home last night,” I said. “What difference is another hour?”
The noise only got louder as I walked through the trees. There was a small clearing, and I edged closer to the water’s edge, careful not to break a twig and disturb this man standing in thigh-deep water with arms raised toward the heavens. His humming continued for a moment, and I realized he was talking to me.
“Devils must leave now,” he yelled. “To bring someone who’s married out here to commit adultery. To subject our beautiful forests to such sin is intolerable.”
After turning around to face me, he lowered his hands and began wading toward me. I didn’t stick around. I ran as fast as I could to the cabin. The truck was ready to go because nothing was unpacked the night before.
“C’mon,” I yelled. “Let’s go!”
“Oh, now you’re ready.”
“Hurry up. I’m leaving in 8 seconds.”
I spun on the loose gravel to get back to town. As we approached pavement, I noticed an old man standing along the road. As he raised his hands, it began to rain."

I can tell her anything and she never judges me. If you asked her, she’d tell you I’m the greatest person alive. Without my angel, I really don’t know what I’d do. I truly feel blessed because I’m lucky to have the mom I got.
She’s that mama bear that would die to protect her cubs. She’s that beautiful bird that toils all day long to bring back food to feed her young. She’s that water buffalo that valiantly fights off the lions as best as she can to protect her young. She’s that pitbull that you don’t want to approach after she has her pups because you know her instinct to protect is stronger than her urge to eat.
She’s all that and more.
My angel lifted me up out of the dirt after I wrecked my bike as a child and cried out “MOMA!” I remember one time when I was in kindergarten and the teacher wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom and I peed my pants in class. When I came home and told my mom what happened, she changed my clothes and told me to get in our car. It was an old Vega and I’ll never forget how mad my mom was. What normally would’ve been a ten minute drive was driven in three minutes flat!
Let me tell you, when my moma is mad, she is MAD! That day, she was livid. She marched into that principal’s office and smacked those wet pants on his desk and gave him the business! My mom was an archangel that day. I’ll never forget that.
My mom saved my life one night. After battling bouts of extreme depression, I decided to end my life one night and when my mother and my step-dad realized I had swallowed a bunch of pills, they took action. My mom called 911, and my step-father gave me CPR.
We live out in the boonies and my mom was forced to run down an old farm road to guide the ambulance to our house. My mother, who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day and smokes all the weed she can, RAN down a farm road. She saved my life that night, along with my step-dad.
So believe it or not, I guess I know two angels.
I love my mom more than anything and now I’m thirty-eight year old and I worry about losing her. What would I do without my angel? I’ll tell you what I’d do; I’d keep moving forward. Or as my mom always tells me at the end of all her letters, “Keep a stiff upper lip!”
That’s a hell of a saying ain’t it? Never let the world see you with your head down. Hold it high and keep a stiff upper lip!"

Since the only thing left to do was head for the swimming hole later, I didn't mind. This connected our property and since they had some age on the both of them, It was the right thing to do.
Cutting her grass was so easy. Most of the yard had trees in back with large rocks. Not much grass would grow there anyway. I did find out If you moved some of the leaves, there was all the worms you would need for a couple of days. Boy do I love to fish.
I will call the fellow next door Tom. He wasn’t home much, but when he showed up. He could walk. He did remind me of Otis Campbell off the Andy Griffith show. I only saw him when he was coming home. His glasses told the story about him walking sideways a lot. They were thick as a six ounce Coke bottle bottom.
It just so happened I was in our yard when I heard a commotion. His wife was giving him a fit. “Just look at you. You can’t even make It to the top step without facing all the way down the others,” she went on to say.
I ran over to see what had happened, and to my surprise there he was-on his side, with a small cut on his forehead. A little blood trickled down slowly. I asked him: “Are you alright?”
He just looked at me as if he never knew me. I tried my best to help him up the steps. His wife told me to let him up the steps. His wife told me to let him be. He could sleep outside tonight. This was not the way I was taught. With his help we both made It to the top step and on the porch. After I turned to leave, she latched onto the screen door.
This I do in life. People need a helping hand no matter the situation. It felt great to help my neighbor and that he wasn’t hurt that bad. I felt saddened when they both passed away later on. The street felt lonely without them.
This I knew deep down, that what happened to him warranted a helping hand, and I would do it all over again."

One of the proudest times I remember was when mom graduated nursing school. I was young but that was a big deal. Mom had made something of herself and set a fine example for us. She was always very protective. When me and Joey stayed home by ourselves the first time, we thought we were hot stuff. Little did we know, mom never left, she stayed outside to make sure we were okay. That was mom being mom. Once, we came home from school and she had made a note sending us on a treasure hunt. When we reached the end of the hunt, we would get our treasure--dessert. When we got to the tree where the dessert was supposed to be, she said, “oops, I forgot to put it out here.” Of course she didn’t forget, you can’t just leave dessert outside but when you’re a kid, you don’t think of that. What mattered was that mom made dessert for us, and we got to go on a treasure hunt. Small things, like walking around the yard with a sharpie, drawing smiley faces on rocks, was a blast. I loved spending time with mom and still do. My dream was to make them proud and even though they say they are, I know the truth. Thwarted dreams.
I met a beautiful woman named Megan, we called her Nikki. I feel in love for the first time in my life and she became my wife. Unfortunately, I was addicted to drugs. I thought I needed the drugs to make me happy. I ended up in prison and realized how happy I was, just being with her, but it was too late. My dream was to marry one person and have it last forever. Thwarted dreams.
Next, I met the second woman I ever loved. Barbara was also beautiful. Her two daughters called me Daddy Jay. I had my own little family; God had answered my prayers. I wanted to give them the world. Instead I came back to prison. Thwarted dreams.
Those are my dreams I’ve thwarted but what about the dreams of others? My parents wanted me to be a success, those two women wanted us to last forever and my stepdaughters always wanted me to be Daddy Jay. I thwarted their dreams too. When I get another chance the only thing I’ll be thwarting is the person I was before."

The third in line, a young member of the pack spoke up.
“Dad. Why do these brown animals leave such deep footprints?
“They are rather large for their size.”(Alpha male thinking a moment)
“Maybe because of how tall they are. Maybe because they weigh so much more than us. As you must have noticed two things here. First, because we’re so light in weight our paws barely sink into the snow. Second, those animals spook so easy, plus they have a hard time walking in the snow as well. If we do this right, we can sneak up on them before they know we’re about.” The alpha male explained.
The quadruplet stopped at the bottom of the rise for a quick breather. Then they pushed onward. The alpha male picked out a big cow that walked with a limp. The alpha cut her off from the herd with help from his second in command. The two younger wolves slowly followed waiting for the signal to help with kill.
The alpha male circled his prey. Second in command kept nipping at the cow elk’s hooves. He lets out a short bark. Now it was on. The two younger wolves came sprinting in for the kill.
The alpha male jumped for the cow elk’s throat. She moved just in time. The youngest member of the group jumped. His teeth sank into the cow’s neck. He hung on for the life of him. The older youngster got hold of a back leg. So did the second in rank. The elk tripped and fell over on her side in the snow.
The alpha male lunged. Got another bite Into the cow's neck. After a few minutes more she stopped fighting and lay still. As the way things work In the wild, the alpha started ripping the cow to get to the meat. Once he has had his fill, did the other eat their fill.
On the way home they steady paced themselves. There would be plenty of meat for the rest of the pack for tomorrow.
“Thanks for the help you youngsters. You have proven to be worthy of becoming the pack’s hunters. Just remember your place so there will be no problems with other pack members and you’ll have no problems. If you want to venture out on your own, you have my blessings. The alpha female understand, so will your baby-sitters. For it is a way of life for us in this world. If we ever run across you and recognize you, you may come back for a while. But if you are gone too long the other pack members will see you as a threat. Again, thanks for your helping hands today. For on the morrow the pack will eat its fill. By the way, you two youngsters are on babysitting duty on the morrow.” The alpha told them.
“When you leave your pack, good hunting, and watch your back,”
The second in rank added to the alpha male’s words.

“Where is my egg you old wretch,” he sneered.
Gertie neither blinked, nor moved to refute him.
“I know you are in there somewhere Golden Gertie,” he snidely continued.
“Now push out my little golden delight, or I will be having foie gras for supper.”
Fenwood licked his chops for dramatic effect, although his theatrics went unheeded. He threw the bedpan across the room; then paced the room for a while, deliberating, and settled on gorging the old goose until the egg burst out of her.
Fenwood sprang downstairs on all fours--yelping like the beast he was, the voracity in him yearning to be satiated. When he returned, his eyes nearly bounded from their sockets, as they wrapped around the lofty pile of golden shelled orbs lying on the bed before him in a wide platter. Gertie was nowhere in sight, and Fenwood half hoped that the old goose had spontaneously combusted. He was so thrilled, so elated, so absorbed--he dropped the bowl he was holding, and practically floated to the treasure trove. He did not hear the door close behind him...or feel the syringe penetrate his skin.
Fenwood gradually returned to consciously on the hard floorboards, and peered through the half open slits of his eyelids into a visage of dread, That beak. Those feathers. He knew them--knew her. He did not want to know the knife she was holding.
Gertie smirked at him, stretching her wings, and wiggling her webbed toes merrily.
“Welcome back...Fen who killed my friend.”
Fenwood tried to move, but something, an anesthetic perhaps, was causing a miscommunication between his brain and limbs. He heard a clattering above him, and could only move his eyes to look up at the swaying mass of glowing golden oblongs ready to drop upon him. Gertie walked over to a taut piece of rope connected to the platter of gold.
“Quite naturally, I’ve always loved Mother Goose. So, I thought it would be fitting to write a nursery rhyme for your eulogy...Goodbye Fen,” Gertie said contentedly, as she cut the rope.
A juicy, bone-crushing, thwack reverberated throughout the manor...then quieted. Gertie pierced the silence with her limerick…
Fenwood, Fenwood,
Always up to no good.
So clever, so crafty, so cunning.
Do better, he should
But GREED tainted his blood,
And he died for his love for money."

She slid closer to her mom on the couch.
Martin leaned back into the chair allowing his arms to drape loosely over the sides. He liked the coziness of the Patton’s living room. He stopped by after hearing that Dale Patton had been laid off and wanted to see if he could offer any comfort or assistance. “I was sad, Alise. We were inseparable at one time.” At their confused look, Martin continued, “Sorry, I know that comment needs explaining. Ruth, may I trouble you for something to drink first?”
“I have coffee or I can heat water for tea. Or there’s ice water.”
“Thank you. Coffee’s fine. No sugar. Do you have creamer?”  “Will milk do?”
“Milk’s fine, Ruth. Thank you.” Martin gathered his thoughts as she prepared and served him. She brought a fairly large mug for which he was grateful. He took a generous sip. “Very good.”
Ruth returned to the couch with Alise.
Martin placed the cup on a coaster on a nearby end table. “When you saw me, Alise, it was an anniversary of sorts. One I’ve commemorated for over forty years now, since I was a little older than you.” He pointed toward her.
She smiled prettily.
“I grew up in this town,” Martin continued, “and I had two best friends: John and Danny.”
“Like me and Sally and Denise.” “Alise, don’t interrupt,” Ruth said.
Martin smiled, “It’s OK, Ruth. Yes, Alise, I suppose it was just like that.”
They waited patiently as Martin took another sip of coffee. Keeping the mug cupped in his hand, Martin said, “People even joked that John and Danny both flunked second grade so we could all graduate together.”
“Is that true?” Alise asked.
“Well, it happened, but I don’t believe they did it purposefully. My mom said they did because I was too ordinary to move up a grade.”
“Really!” Ruth said.
“Oh, mom never meant anything by it. Besides,” he chuckled, “it was true.”
“So where are John and Danny now?” asked Alise.
“Heaven.” Martin felt the tightening in his chest. HOw much should he share? He took another sip of the now tepid coffee and placed it back on the coaster. “The summer before our eighth grade year, we were going to play ball at the park, but I had to mow the yard first. They decided to meet me…” The words choked in Martin’s throat.
“It’s OK, Reverend,” Ruth said. “You don’t need to go on.”
Martin wiped at his eyes and took a deep breath. “Maybe… Maybe I do. It downpoured the night before and flooded the culvert. John jumped in not realizing the strength of the current. It sucked him down. Danny tried to save him.”
“My Lord,” Ruth said, pulling Alise closer. “I heard about that. That’s the reason for the fence and the signs.”
“We were inseparable,” Martin said almost to himself. “I should’ve been with them. Before that summer ended, I tried to join them.”
“Reverend…”
Martin held up his hand. “It’s OK. Obviously I didn’t succeed, though I came close.” He clasped his hands together and looked intensely at Ruth and Alise. “Before I came out of the coma, God spoke to me. He told me not to worry about John and Danny -- that they were OK. He told me He wanted me to remain to save other lives.”
“So you became a minister,” Alise said.
“Yes. I became a minister.”"

The locals called it “Peaceful Peaks.” The dock looked so inviting. I could sit for hours there. Talk about a spectacular sunrise when the sun just kissed the top of the peak. It was sure magical. With my eyes closed, I reflected back on my youth with my dog. He would have loved it here.
The grass stayed trimmed to the water’s edge. Nestling just less than fifty feet from the tree line, a nice log cabin sat. It was fully furnished and could be a perfect investment for the future. Any help had to be flown in since there were no roads.
Mary grew up like I did. She loved the outdoors and could fish. Most of all, how she loved to bait a trotline. She grew up with four brothers. Her passion was making lures. Mary has a competitive spirit. She could out clean her four brothers when it came to fish. That is why I enjoyed being around her. It takes being a strong, competitive person in order to survive in this world.
Mary and I went out for a social event. She had never been to a high society gathering like this. I listened with a tentative ear as we discussed business. Mary was mingling with the female guest. She always looked ravishing in a dress or plain blue jeans. It was really hard to not eye her the way the dress floated with every move. Ever so often she would look back in the area where I stood and smile.
Even in elementary school I knew she would be my girl. Our careers would have to come first. That was our solemn pact, that our feelings would be on hold until we were totally happy with what we have accomplished. No one in the room could hold a candle to her. Have you ever wanted something or someone to the point you felt like you would just die? If you didn’t get it, that is how I felt about Mary. She was forever on my mind.
I called Frank Martin at the hanger. It was eleven thirty in the evening. We both could be in Paris by four thirty in the morning, just in time to have breakfast. Frank was a loyal friend and a great pilot. He loved the speed of the Lear Jet, and how it handled. He let me fly a little, only with him by my side.
Mary and I sat on the patio of the villa. “I have never seen a place so beautiful in the morning,” she said. The sunrise was majestic. I asked her, “Would you love to live in a place more beautiful than this?”
“Do you know a place?” She replied.
The next morning we flew to the nearest airport and took a local float plane to the lake. Once inside she fell in love with it. I had already bought the place. Everything she had ever given me over the years now lined the walls. Over the mantle the locals made a sign and blessed the cabin. It was our last effort to be happy.

All these gov-crats eat plenty of breakfast like me. We recently discovered this during the last three ""botched"" executions where the gov-crats' victims writhed in agony for up to 30 minutes before finally being hideously murdered. One lawyer-apologist said they'd death-sentenced 900 victims since 1975, when lawyers were given back their privilege of death-sentence. Then it was told that 144 death sentences were found, through DNA proof, to have been given to innocent victims. Simple math (144/900) shows us that, AT MINIMUM, the lawyers' death convictions are of the innocent 16% of the time. This failure rate is too high for any business to survive, but gov-crats get away with it easily.
It also means that, when the cops and law-crats trick a jury into killing somebody, he has only an 84% chance of being actually guilty! And this is their BEST CASE scenario!
So, all citizens should be very alert, especially to gov-crime, because every day, the odd becomes greater that the gov-crats are eating YOU for breakfast!"

She said she had no idea what they meant. But with every sign we passed, my curiosity grew.
Over the next couple of days, the frequency of towns increased. She had to stop in every one. Usually, I just waited on the tracks while she visited the little shops in each place. She’d head off to the right or left, disappear for an hour and return, beaming. She loved people. When she finally convinced me to tag along, I had to admire the ease at which she took to people, and they to her. No matter the town, she spoke their language, her body moving loosely as she laughed and threw her arms around them. They loved her like a long lost daughter.
And me, I was treated as the outsider they intuitively sensed I was, with cold stares and stiff bodies. She didn’t notice. Every morning, she woke up eager to explore. I woke up dreading the loneliness I now felt creeping between us.
As we walked, I began to notice things about her beloved towns. At first glance, they seemed ordinary. But waiting on the tracks forced me to notice little things. Like how the houses on one side seemed alive, vibrant with green lawns, with an aura of satisfaction. On the other side of the tracks, the house seemed identical. Yet, they seemed to exhale resignation, their frames starting to slouch, lawns beginning to yield to weeds.
I asked her about it but she said she hadn’t noticed. Yet, whenever we stopped, she always headed toward the slightly better side of town. It happened too often to be an accident.
Later, we passed through a town where trucks were having houses from one side of the tracks to the other. Some of the people watching were crying. I know something terrible was happening. She didn’t stop in this town, her body tight as she walked away, clearly uncomfortable.
A mile later, I asked her, “What was that all about?” She shrugged but I could tell she knew something, It was the first time she had hidden anything from me. Once, I happened to glance at her as we passed one of the curious signs. I was shocked. The look in her eyes as she stared at the sign was not one of indifference, but recognition. Which is which, when she vanished into another town, I snuck off to solve the mystery of those signs. Alone in a dusty library, I read, “In order to facilitate social harmony, each community shall establish by vote who will and will not live on the other side of the tracks. A set of railroad tracks shall be constructed in every community, should none already exist. Relocation of all residents shall be completed by January 1 of next year. Passed by the state legislature - P.L. 18 -156.”
Things made a lot more sense after that.
It helped me notice the small wooden signs concealed along the tracks outside every town, noticeable only to those who knew to expect them. One pointed right, the other left. Everyone would know their place. Taxpayers to the right, Freeloaders to the left. Sick to the right, healthy to the left. Citizens/Illegals, Law Abiding/Criminal Records, Believes/Heathens. On and on. It didn’t take a genius to figure out who ended up on the better side of town.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I asked later, my question an accusation. She had an expression of guilt but said nothing for a few miles.
“It doesn’t really impact our plans” she eventually replied. “We’re not the type of people to live on the other side of the tracks.”
In that moment, it all came together. Her home state. This trip. Her frequent excursions into every town. The secrecy. I wasn’t the only one being vetted. No, she was searching for the perfect town in which to put down roots. Both our roots. Something inside me recoiled. We stopped talking.
One afternoon, we approached a town, this one backed up against a lush forest. But we struggled to pass through. All over and around the tracks, tables and chairs had been set up where people of all ages and backgrounds smiled and chatted. To the sides, people bustled around long tables, readying serving dishes and slow cookers for a giant potluck. No matter where we turned, our pain was blocked by people clustered in boisterous conversation.
Suddenly, a sharp voice rose above all the others. “Order! We must have order! Lester, please shut up!” The murmur faded as people sat, revealing an older woman standing on a chair. “We only have seven months so we must reach a decision today. So I need some suggestions.”
Discussion quietly rumbled before someone called out, “How about we move all the bald people to the otherside of the tracks?” Tentative chuckles followed.
“Ronald,” another shouted, “that toupee isn’t fooling anyone!” A few laughs.
“How about people who mow their lawns at six in the morning?” yelled a woman. All eyes turned to one man. He was smiling.
“Hey, I like to get an early start.” More laughter.
Now everybody got into it. Innies and outies. Husbands who leave the toilet seat up. Wives who talk during football games. People howled, wiping tears of laughter from their eyes.
Only the woman’s insistent voice calmed the crowd. “Let’s be serious now. Look, I have a list of suggestions from the State.” She consulted a piece of paper as people groaned.
“Over fifty and under?” she started. Protesting voices. “How about with kids and without?” More angry shouts. “Straight and gay? Republicans and Democrats? What?”
Finally, A tall woman stood. “Look, Evelyn. Anyway we do this, we’re breaking apart friendships, some decades old. We’re splitting families. This is all about separation but this town has always been about helping one another, through thick and thin. No matter how we divide us up, we’re destroying all that’s good about us.”
The crowd erupted into applause and Evelyn stepped down in defeat. “So what do you want to do?” she asked.
There was a pause before someone yelled, “Lets eat!” The crowd stood as one and flowed toward the tables of food, making sure the elderly and little children stood first in line.
For the first time since we had arrived, I looked at my girlfriend. Her face was contorted in disgust. Disgust at these crowds. Disgust at all this mixing. Disgust at people’s lack of disgust with each other.
She grabbed my arm. “Come on,” she hissed. “This isn’t our kind of town.”
I stood still, surrounded by people of all hue and background who simply enjoyed being together. She pulled again.
Then I said words we both knew were coming. “You go on, I think I’ll stay for a while.”
She looked at me, her eyes first questioning and then understanding.Then she turned, edged through the people and walked down to the tracks alone where she would find a different kind of town to welcome her.
With sadness, I watched him go until someone thrust a plate into my hand, clapped me on the shoulder and nudged me toward the food.
“Come friend, help yourself.”
In the few days I stayed, a decision was never reached and I often wondered in the decades since, what happened. Other towns built walls or in difficulty watched one side disintegrate. Some towns disappeared altogether as both sides rotted away from the inside.
Which is why I have come back. On the left side, beautiful houses with green lawns and playing children extend to the forest. On the right, a vacant, overgrown field holds crumbling foundations of the houses that had once sat there. But there is no sadness on either side. No, the houses on the right had all been moved across the tracks to join the houses on the left.
“Look at that,” my wife says, pointing to the two signs which inform us what side is ours. The sign pointing to the happy town reads “Unity”. And the sign pointing to the empty field? “Division.” The town had reached a decision after all.
The sun is warm even as it sets. Somewhere in town, a picnic is coming to life. After all, we can hear the laughter and smell the barbeque.
“Let’s go,” she says with a grin. We leave the tracks, hand in hand and head towards the party knowing, without a doubt that we will be welcome."

Why would I believe such anyway? I decided to do an in depth, exhaustive, objective study on religion. Where and when did they arise, and why?
Over the following twenty-four years, I learned and determined that we are more than physical body. More than, from dust to dust. This, a truth I feel one must experience and find for themselves. The how is not so important. For a truth is only truly known through personal experience. Otherwise, we are only parroting something we heard. Maybe, it tickled our ears, so we accept it as a truth. Or, possibly, it scares us, so the fear is accepted as a truth, and etc.
That is not to suggest, categorically, you must experience everything to know the truth of it. However, after twenty-three years into the thirty I had to do the sentence, I was diagnosed with a fatal cancer, with only a 40% chance of living five years. That of course would be under conditions I would never see in prison. I had several years left. This whole thing just kept getting worse. No way was I protected.
At the federal medical center, I became friends with a person who was searching for spiritual answers. He felt traditional religion had let him down, and had many unanswered questions. We ended up spending hours walking, where I shared with him what I had studied and learned. I shared what I had experienced and had seen.
I told him I didn’t have any answers. There is something, I’m sure. A creator or creative energy, I would think is reasonable to believe. But, names or organized religions, religious teaching, dogmas and beliefs were not absolutes. These, not worth the time, energy, nor breath to argue about. None of the strongly held beliefs, good deeds as a result of my faith in those beliefs, protected me.
I lost my adult life. When I get out, if I live that long, half my life will have been in prison. The difference in exactly half, from July 23rd to October 28th. A life devoid of love, compassion, kindness, forgiveness, affection, all the gifts of God, life.
The more we talked, the more I shared, my pessimism faltered. I heard my error. I expected to get something from life. My correct attitude, now realized, it is what we contribute to life, which empowers and satisfies our being. The very fact I was trying to help this person, after all of my calamities and near death experiences, was ample evidence, in fact, I have been protected all along. My heart was still loving and good."

Some people won’t leave the drugs alone. That is the normal sense is to stop. Some have to stop with their lives. I have been down twenty-eight years. Not once I have let drugs or alcohol take control of my life. I guess I love myself too much to be a slave for another.
Everything I had on the street was gone in a Blink of an Eye. But it was not drugs that did that to me. It was just my own stupidity. Sometimes we get wrapped up in our own little world that we forget what is really important to us all. I wanted my cake and to eat it too. Forgetting about the responsibilities I had to my wife and kids. Now it’s too late to correct the past. In order to live life true, we all have to learn from our mistakes and go forward. Not to make the same mistakes over and over again.
People like myself have taken life for granted. Then when they say the crap hits the fan, it is too late then. Why not correct one’s self before this happens?
I tried to correct my past and go forward. At times it is hard. To sit and think about all that was lost. I hear people tell others it isn’t fair. But what is that way in life?

I was brave, adventurous, and creative. The first couple of days were simple. I was curious the first time that I realized my poop was gone. A week into it, a couple of chickens followed me around the side of the house. It wasn’t easy trying to take a dump with a bunch of chickens pushing you around.
Chickens are snitches. They tell everybody. I had to hide from the chickens just to use the restroom. I came strolling out of the cornfield with about thirty hens on my heels. I looked like the Pied Piper. I actually felt like a king with his court. Then grandpa tells me “you know them are them same chickens you been eating? You stop feeding them chickens shit.” “I’m not” I’d say. He’d just looked at me.
I remember exactly how I felt. You don’t have to lie to grandpa; you don’t need to or think to. So the first time I did it seared into my memory. I didn’t take it back or apologize. I quit feeding the chickens though. My shame was a more powerful motivation. I used the outhouse every day. I quit being a chicken. My gratitude is to the chickens, because of them I had to overcome fear, shame, and embarrassment. I found inner strength."

We decide to quit going to events, stop paying dues. We are still in love. We get married, as I had predicted (I also confess the full truth of how I’d lied and such to meet her. She does not see this as “stalkery”-- it is “romantic.”) Within about 18 months, we divorce. I do not suggest choosing brides based on “love at first sight.” Moving on...
Years go by. I have a job that requires me to fly 4 or 5 times a year, and I fly for personal trips once or twice a year, too. I love flying; it is a joy, every time. Except for maybe security.
Those familiar with TSA screening may also have experience with the special screening process assigned to (supposedly) “random” tickets. The normal screening is tedious-- metal detector walk-thru, an x-ray of your carry-on, a lot of waiting, not a big deal-- but special cases, they get invasive. They use a wand, pick over your clothing, eviscerate your carry-on, get demonstrations of your electronics… it takes a while longer after all that waiting to get to security.
When I fly, I get special TSA screening. Every. Time. So 5 to 10 trips a year, security both ways, means special screening 10 to 20 times a year. I have heard it said, when I was a kid, that you should arrive for your flight about an hour early. Once TSA ramped up after 9-11, they said two hours ahead. When I fly, I give myself three hours.
But now, jump to today (August 2019), it’s been ten years since I last flew, and I miss it. I miss airlines, baggage claim, the weird 70’s chairs, overpriced doodads in the gift shops, strange waiting spaces with big broad-leaf plants, culturally local art in major spaces, the “moving sidewalks,” the tiny drinks and snacks in-flight, arm-rests with unused ashtrays in them, all of it. When I EOS in a few years, I will gladly put up with four or five hours of TSA screening so that I can enjoy the flight from northern Florida to upstate New York, with the final reward of seeing my family at the gate when I land.
But I will also wonder-- as my meager possessions are scrutinized in detail by TSA personnel, thoroughly-- whether the screening is a result of my youthful association with the Socialist Workers Party. And even if it ended badly, I must admit-- she’s worth it.

Pete emerged through the glassy surface of the lake, trounced but still willing to keep trying. Pedro looked down at Pete, shaking his furry head -- either in mirth, or because he was dogged in devouring every hidden morsel within his toy. Pete climbed back up onto the pier, and was greeted by a few peanut buttery licks to his forehead from his pup. Pete was still resolute. He stood straight up again, and stepped forward...splashing roughly into the smooth waves once more.
Pete kept at it until the entire span of copious clouds overhead had departed with the winds, and the sun had begun to set the valley ablaze in auburn. Pete was floating on his back in his skivvies, along with the tide; his sopping clothing in a pile on the pier, his bible polka-dotted with water droplets of various widths -- Pedro still observing and resting his haunches, toy still between his teeth. Pete’s mind drifted from biblical miracles to mouth-watering thoughts of dinner. He slowly turned his body in the flowing current, swam a short clip, and hoisted himself back onto the pier with the last bit of his ever-tapering energy.
Pedro tilted his head, still gnawing on his gnarled up plaything, and gave Pete an inquisitive stare. Pete curiously eyeballed him back.
“What? My name’s Peter, but I’m no apostle, disciple or saint -- and even that Peter only made it a few steps. This whole experiment was just wishful thinking. I’m done for the day bud.”
Pete began to walk away, but Pedro finally dropped his toy from his mouth, and began to whimper for Pete’s undivided attention. He trained his stare from Pete, to the lake, and back to Pete again. Pete squatted down and kneaded behind Pedro’s ears with both hands.
“I am not going for another dunk in the lake buddy. No way.”
Pedro whined again and freed himself out of Pete’s kind clutch to go prod at the water-speckled pages of the open bible with his nose. He even gave it a little paw push in Pete’s direction.
“No Pedro. I’m done. Finito. No more reading, no more splashy.”
Pete groaned tiredly as he scooped the bible away; and grabbed up the chew toy and two armfuls of his soaked clothes.
“I appreciate your enthusiasm bud, but I am tired and hungry...I bet you are too?”
Pete turned to head back to his quaint cabin home, but Pedro barked defiantly behind him. Pete turned to his determined pup -- who was no standing firm against the pier’s edge.
“Okay, you wanna take a dip? Be my guest…”
Pete gave the rounded toy a good pitch into the lake, and watched it bobble a beckon to Pedro. Pete then turned and began his journey back indoors, hearing Pedro’s collar tinkling off in the direction of the water. Pete was nearing his lawn when Pedro finally came panting and jingling up beside him; his toy triumphantly in his mouth, his tail wagging joyfully, and his swarthy fur coat -- DRY."

Sally squeezed her fingers into her tiny pocket, fishing out the two pennies. Her balance was all over the place, hopping on toes, kicking out a bare leg, then correcting the mayhem with arms cartwheeling out wide,
The horn wailed again, closer this time, a glint of its headlight peeking through the fog...really close.
Sally squeaked. Icy adrenaline raced through her veins, her fingers and toes tingled. She needed to hurry. She squatted down, one bare foot and leg extended for balance, placed the two pennies on the cold steel rail, just in front of her painted toenails.
The ground began to shake.
Barefoot Sally stood back up. She was stranded. She couldn’t walk across the jagged rocks, she needed to hurry back to the plank. Sally gave her pennies a farewell glance before she turned tail to run down the rail. The pennies were shaking just like the rail.
The horn blared again, frightfully loud. Sally looked up just as the engine burst free of the fog. The horn blared again, not short like before, long and distressful. Sally stared at the racing train, blank, empty, confused. The screeching of steel wheels on steel rails rose above the constant blaring horn. The vibrations tickled her bare feet.

The doctor confirmed second degree burns and wrote a prescription for the Silvadene burn ointment. Through many products I’ve used, Silvadene is the best (or arguably the best) burn cream. We talked about the medicine and how the injury occurred. “A stupid injury,” I remember thinking. “The whole thing could have come at me, grease and all.” Not a great way to take care of your face, etc.
Mindfulness wasn’t a term I’d heard until prison I think. Awareness isn’t as hippie-sounding. That’s probably why. Though in any case, conservative teachings aside, situational awareness can be very important, like Jeff Cooper taught. Sure, it could have been worse. A close call for me, to be optimistic, and for the poor girl’s job I imagine. I’m still a fan of Pay-less supermarket. While she told me to grab one, surely, by her reaction, it wasn’t to see me burned. Still, as far as the ability to have a nice lawsuit for her and the store, it was also a close call."

She calls me father, and you and I both know that I am not her father. Why wouldn’t you tell me that you were pregnant before we did what we did that night, and that you weren’t sure who made you pregnant? You made me believe that she was my daughter: I love her, and it broke my heart to find out that she is not mine. It felt like you betrayed me again, but this time, it felt like you ripped my heart out of my chest with your hand. Had I known that you were pregnant with his child, my actions would’ve been different. You would be where he is at now! Don’t walk away from me when I am talking to you, bitch! I’m sorry Doris, I didn’t mean to call you that. Please stop crying baby. Come here, I just want to hold you in my arms. It’s been 3 months since we last touched each other. As much as it hurts, I do still love you.
You can never take back what happened: a life was created, and we can never forget what we did. Everytime we look at her, we see his face. Even my family knows that she is not my child. Why do you think my mother never asked to spend time with Ebony? Everyone knows Doris: it’s no secret. They said something to me about it; they just have not said anything to you about it. How could you have unprotected sex with him knowing that you could get pregnant or risk bringing something home to me? Do you hate me that much, Doris?
No Nkrumah! You don’t understand; it’s not what you think. I do love you, you are my king. After I realized the mistake I was making, I went to his house to end the relationship with him because I love you. He pulled a gun on me then made me undress. He raped me telling me that he would kill me if I did not do exactly what he said, then he said that he would drive to our house and kill you and Alton too. I begged him to put on a condom, and he could do whatever he wanted to do to me. He told me that he would make sure you found out about us because he was going to get me pregnant with his child. And he recorded the rape and promised to send you a copy. I cried the entire time he raped me. He let me get up around 4:30 pm and clean myself up and told me that if I called the police and report it, he would kill us before they catch him. You have no idea how I felt inside not knowing if it was his baby or yours. I am so sorry, Nkrumah--please forgive me. I went to Planned Parenthood to get an abortion, but I thought, what if the baby was yours? I couldn’t kill our baby. How I prayed that Ebony was yours, but when I saw her face after she was born, I knew she was his child. My heart just wanted to stop beating. I went back to his house to find them, but I could not find the copy he said he would make. Please don’t hate me, Nkrumah.
Please stop crying, Doris. I don’t hate you. I’m sorry what happened to you. I wish you had told me so that I could understand.
It’s 3 am in the morning, who in the hell could be knocking on our door at this time in the morning? Who is it!
It’s Detective Garrison from the Houston Police Department Homicide Division. I am looking for Doris to ask her a few questions about someone she dated.
I turned around and made eye contact with Doris, and she pulled her 9mm out of her Chanel hand bag. She told me that she does love me, then told me to open the door and let him in. I told Doris that I love her too and grabbed my 9mm then reached for the door knob."

Should have went on to the farm first. There has to be something worthwhile. Have to stop and rest as I’m running low on fuel.
I closed my eyes for a moment. At least I thought it was. A couple of hours later, my legs stretch and I’m on my feet. I let out a yawn. The farm couldn’t be more than a hundred yards. Still have to be alert. I know they had a dog and he just disappeared one day.
The yard looks clear. Wait a minute; there is a girl in the yard. What is that she has in her hand? Some kind of thing with wheels on it. There, it moved by itself. It can’t be. This is my lucky day. That is the biggest chicken I have ever seen. Just look at that. I could feed my family for days with that. Have to control myself. Just one more backflip. That will do it.
That girl just won’t go away. She just lingered around, rubbing that big chicken. Slowly, I crept around the edge of the field. Just out of sight. This is just too good to be true. The girl ran inside the house. Still I have to wait. It could be a trick. Once I was able to get close enough to see what it was, I realized it wasn’t a chicken after all, but a big goose. That is even better. There will be extra meat.
Now I know why it was sitting. It was too heavy to fly and that thing was holding it. That is good for me, I won’t have to drag it. Hope that girl stays away.
Once I was behind it, I could see it was preoccupied. Not a sound was made. When he turned his head and looked at me, my paws were already on the handle. I tried to push with my hind legs. I had gotten weaker by traveling such a distance. Still he made no sound. Just that look he gave let me know I was wasting my time.
No matter how hard I tried, it just wasn’t going to move. If I get you home your goose will be cooked. What do you think of that? My eyes felt as if they were going to pop out. This will have to be abandoned. No one likes to admit defeat. Most of all a sly fox.
Returning to the den empty wasn’t a positive note. I tried to explain how big the chicken was. I did tell her it was a goose instead. Two hungry pups and when she bit my ear, leaving two holes, I knew I would be sleeping on the other end of the den. I’ll give it another try tomorrow. I’m just too tired. I’ll close my eyes and dream of Supper’s On."

Stuck in this prison for so long for someone else’s crime.
The picture captured the essence of Suzie’s soothing presence.
The day I took that picture Suzie knew I needed her music to get through rough times. My sister Jenny just died, I was told in school. She whispered to me “meet me at our special place. I will play a song for you.”
Throughout all my life the memory of that day, and her calming song helped me through hard times.
In the picture you can see that Suzie is at peace, and it calms me.
I still remember the day the judge sentenced me to 1,000 years in prison. I looked back at Suzie. “She shut her eyes, and simply said meet me at our special place.” Immediately I remembered that day, and her song got me through the sentencing.
Then I went to prison and had my first life and death situation. After the fight I hurried to call Suzie. When she answered the phone I was almost in tears. “Suzie,” I say. “I had no choice, and I almost killed them.” I explained that 2 guys came at me, and I had to defend myself or die. Suzie asked, “Do you still have it, John?” I said:
“Yeah I have the picture I took of you in our special place.” Suzie said,
“Close your eyes and meet me at our special place. I will play a song for you, John.” I grabbed the pictures and studied them for a brief moment. I remembered that day so vividly in my mind. I realized that Suzie is at peace because she was calming me with her song. I closed my eyes and Suzie played her song on that flute over the phone. Once again we were at our special place.
Appeal after appeal was denied, and it always was the same. Suzie would simply ask,
“Do you still have it John?” I would reply,
“Of course I do Suzie. You know I need you and our special place to get through it.” She would play that song, and all the roughness of a cruel world would melt away.
Then one day I received a letter in the mail from Suzie. It simply said, “Call me and John. You are going to marry me in our special place.” I raced to the phone, and my heart was pounding. What was Suzie talking about, I thought? It had been 30 years now since I was arrested.
I called Suzie, and she answered the phone. I asked Suzie, “How can I marry you in our special place? I am still in prison, and all the appeals have been denied.”
Then I heard her flute and that song that calmed me for so many years. When Suzie is finished with her song she speaks:
“John, I found the gas station you were in. The one three states away. John, the gas station owner saved the film, and we have you on camera three states away at the time the crime was taking place.”
That call was 6 months ago. Now we are at our special place, and we are about to be married. I put the picture in my pocket.
Suzie looks at me and shuts her eyes. She plays her song, and all the sorrows of yesterday melt away. We then are married!"

Illustrations were quite graphic, detailing Adam and Eve’s flight from Eden in shame, to the monstrous and sinister Tower of Babel, to Moses commanding through God that the Golden Calf be destroyed. As mom read, I kept thinking that the Old Testament was no place for a kid until we came to the chapter on David bringing down Goliath. In my mind, I fantasized owning a slingshot that might be powerful enough to take off a giant’s head in one throw. David became an early hero of mine.
As we continued to wait for the nurse to call my name, I fingered Mom’s charm bracelet. By this point, she would have encouraged me to get down from her lap and climb up into the next chair, leaning against her or against a heating pad that she hoped would dry up the already-boiling fluid coursing across my eardrum. On her bracelet were, among other objects: a molar that someone from Dad’s dental society had given her; a four-leaf clover; two teensy baby booties, one for Jeff and one for me. Even in my own young hands, these charms were fascinating miniatures, kind of like sterling silver versions of the clay toys we could pick out of the treasure chest following our six-month visit to the dentist, where Jeff always threw up.
Examining these trinkets dangling from my mother’s wrist, my burning and aching ear was lulled by each object’s comforting clink as I rotated her bracelet over and over. Then I traced the vitiligo patches up and down her arm, white splotches that made me fear she might be disappearing. The tinkling chatter on her bracelet, I imagined, would be the only way I might ever have of locating her in the world if she were to vanish completely. In that waiting room, I clung to that bracelet and her restful voice, reading and reassuring."

You’re a city boy. You don’t really want to learn, do you? You’re still all electrified from the city, although not so much as when you came up here to California.”
“Yes I’m sure Dad. But before we do this, let’s go to church.”
“You know me and God don’t believe in each other right?”
“I know it’s just I feel the need for some church! Free coffee and doughnuts! Me and you both know it’s a business, sometimes it’s good to fake it and be around others.”
“Alright this one time.”
My father really hated church, but I was a little son of a bitch who liked to play tricks and get under people's skin. This quaint little church had a great group of eclectic individuals. Very optimistic and positive people. At a young age, I was very intelligent and knew that it would be good for my father and me to be around new people and situations. Life is full of different places and faces and I wanted to see it and experience them all!
After we finished our church adventure, my dad was grumpy and real quiet. He could be like that, very moody and sensitive at times. Maybe it was because I had put my foot on the brake pedal and jumped out of a moving vehicle to go to church. Haha. I was bold, too bold. In contrast, when dad was happy, his energy was magnetic. His aura just drew people out of the dust, I must say!
We drove to an army surplus store and picked up a handmade bow made of oak. With arrows for 500 dollars, I was very happy. My dad sure as hell wasn’t because of the price, but I was spoiled as a child even though we didn’t have a lot. We drove out to the desert and were now somewhere in New Mexico. We first set up camp and then fired off on targets. Back then, my dad had a compact bow with a scope!
“Let me try yours, Dad!”
“You ain’t strong enough Son,” he spoke like a cowboy, or John Wayne, whom he idolized. “But I love you enough to trust ya. Take a good pull and see if it doesn’t do you in,” he replied. I notched an arrow and it took off so fast, it busted our 15 dollar styrofoam targets in half. I had set up all targets in a special angle, one behind another. “Holy shit, there goes another 15 dollars but damn, you’re strong boy!” He actually started whooping and hollering. His girlfriend Loretta was from Texas and she remained in the background the whole time, as if she knew the inner power I had within. Her and I liked each other a lot. She told me if I was 18 and had a beard, she would be with me and we’d date. But I was too young and she said she, “...wasn’t no cougar.”
Later on that night, my dad fired us up some smokes and let me drink some white wine. He wouldn’t allow me to smoke weed. He said I was too young and he wouldn’t be babysitting. He was pushing me to be a man at 14 and to be honest, I loved him for it and hated it at the same time. I was always somewhat of a rebel as a kid, yet I could be good too. There’s the duality of human nature. “Son, this is the only time I will allow you to drink, I don’t care if you smoke. You’ve shown great skill and here’s your reward.” That was one of the times my father was truly beaming with energy, when I started to show promise.
Eventually, we made it to Mississippi while picking up a few hitchhikers along the way. They were really strange and cool. One stood out though. His name was Tiny Tim and he was a carnie. What a fucking character this guy was. He could stand on his head, fix anything, shoot, and make everyone laugh as well. He had some bad luck when he lost his job after he came to work drunk and lost a finger setting up one of his rides. After doing a variety of jobs, people began to call him Tiny Tim because of his middle finger is so small. He flicked off a lot of people too, so the name stuck. One day he said to me after we smoked some ganja, “I was tired of it, so one day I left everything. My house and my woman and I got up and went just about everywhere.”
I asked, “How old are ya Tiny Tim?”
“22 I think. I can’t remember much. Too much drugs.”
Later we got a hotel, turned on the news, and we soon discovered Tiny Tim had killed over 10 people and escaped a mental hospital for the criminally insane! Good thing we weren’t killed. As my Dad went out to get groceries, Loretta cried on my shoulder and we kissed. She was a tall buxom blond with red ruby lips and a full bosom... But that was it. “That’s only a taste of what real manhood is,” she said to me. Dad came back with some liquor and weed. “Y'all deserve a treat for my ignorance, coulda got us all killed.” That’s the first time I had ever seen him tear up. I received extraordinary happiness later that night when I was high and got to see my dad’s girl strip for both of us. The freakiest road trip ever. My dad was a biker and Indian, so this was his treat to me teaching me about our “other side.”"

“You see, young man, the reason my room is not filled with furniture, flowers, pictures, and cards is because I want my last days to be focused on my one true failure.

Hello, my name is Clara, writing to you from Prisoner Express. Your picture theme essay for August of last year was misplaced, so it had just arrived to me. I’m so sorry this wasn’t found earlier and put into the essay packet for that month. I still wanted to write to you because the story you wrote was so beautiful. I thought you might want to have your story back for safekeeping too. If at any point you get a chance to publish it, I really think you should take the opportunity. With a little bit of editing/polishing, this one will be a gem!
*Best Wishes,*

*Clara*

My friends, my heart were literally transformed from stone to flesh as I cried. I could have sat there and read 10,000 more words from this stranger’s heart. Her gentle words danced on the stage of love, bringing kindness and encouragement into my world of bleak despair. Her honesty took captive my broken spirit. Her actions of unselfish love breathed a new breath of life into this almost dead writer! Her warmth embraced me with arms of hope. Out of the ashes I began to rise! A week later I had won the column writing contest for a magazine called “REDEEMED!” My award was $40 for my entry story and a guaranteed contract to write four more columns at $40 per entry. Grand total: $200. Not bad for a writer who was almost dead!
Though Clara hadn’t written 10,000 words of love, I’ve read her words of unfeigned love 10,000 times! Never let Satan kill you, my friends. Your words of love may be the words that breathe hope into someone else’s broken dreams. Now you’ve learned how one girl’s heart revived a writer who almost died! I want to thank you Clara, for your unselfish, unfeigned love for others. Though we will never meet, my heart thanks yours for lifting me out of the world of uncertainty, back into the world where love conquers all!"

Darkness filled the cell. He heard the rhythmic breathing of his cellie. A toilet flushed from the nearby restroom.
Almost never did he experience such vivid dreams. Yet those eyes stayed with him, practically hovering in the darkness. They were his eyes. He played it over and over in his head trying to make sense of it.
Pounding on his locker jarred him. “C’mon Harris! I’d’ve thought you’d been awake.”
Ethan looked up to glimpse officer Trotman’s smirk as he moved on.
“Idiot,” Ethan heard his cellie say.
“Sorry Perkins.”
“Not your doing, Ethan. Bet you’re gonna miss that.”
“I’m not going to miss any of it.”
“Not even me?” Perkins asked.
Ethan sat up and regarded him. Perkins lay flat on his back with his hands tucked under his head. “Even at my wife’s absolute worst, she’s a beauty queen when compared to you.”
“It ain’t my looks you’re gonna miss. It’s my engaging personality and witty comebacks.”    “You left out your uncanny ability to fart at will.”
“Bet that’s something your wife can’t do,” Perkins said while letting one fly.
“Thank God for that. Dang Perkins,” Ethan said as he shifted to the side, placed his feet on the floor and leaned back against the block wall. His mind drifted back to the dream. Somewhere along the range someone coughed.
“What’s up Harris? You seem pretty glum for a guy who’s going home.”
“Nah, just thinking about a dream I had.” Ethan recounted the dream.
“Hmm,” Perkins said, “sounds to me like you’re scared.”
“I’m not scared.”
“Ok, then it’s prophetic and you’re gonna join ISIS.”
“Why would I join ISIS?” Ethan asked.
“To prove me wrong when I say you’re scared.”
Ethan smiled, “scared’s pretty strong.” “Nervous then.”
“I cannot accept that.”
Perkins rolled onto his side and propped his head with his hand. “You know, the world gets suddenly big outside that fence.”
“You getting philosophical on me now, Perkins?”
“Just sayin’. Neighbors’ll all be staring at you. You’ll have to explain to potential employers over and over where you been the last fifteen years. Your family will have to adjust their lives to include you. All those natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and floods.
“We don’t have earthquakes or floods.”
“Tornadoes then.”
“I hope your next cellie doesn’t shower. Ever.”
Perkins laughed. “You’ll be fine.”"

The smoke-filled horizon, paints the sunset
better than any Afro-Bob piece…
And the mountains still overshadow
The lost plains of foliage
Burnt black, like the heart-
The soul, that I am
Being…
Just as one lone tree, standing
Refusing to succumb to the fiery darts
Of Satan…
While a wildfire rages on
Out of control
As my hand - like a hunter, consumes
Firefighters’ lives
Sade, is the truth… as I manage;
Held within,
The picture of a beautiful sunset’s horizon
(OR)

Something…
Like a white snake, escaping bombs and torpedoes
‘Cause I can’t seem to look at you - or look up…
So just, close the door - settle in… (It hurts too much)
The memories ’r’ like, daggers in my back (knockin’ me off track…)
Something like… dancing… with… bombs and torpedoes…
I feel like I’m in the wake of a raid
Where war plane, meets airplane (seems all the same)...
Stranger than this strange land
Is the air I breathe out there: No loud voices,
No banging doors of cells…
There’s… more false lighting than any sunshining
I could ever hope to see out there…
It turns my eyes three different colors
Like torn-up books, with folders for covers -
I can’t tell which is real: prison, breath, or death
With, posted-over walls (and floors painted colors
Of my last cars)
I wonder, at the bars…
Who needs cages, at Central Prison’s Walls?
We’re all just barters - don’t hollar!
At the warehouse doors…
To, bombs and torpedoes
Driving, insane - all!
So where’s your scars…
As C.O.’s escort, wherever we go…

It was through these shows that I found out about Nirvana and Green Day long before those bands topped the Billboard charts.
Through Green Day, I discovered bands like Operation Ivy, Rancid, Offspring, and Bad Religion and the like who were about to ride a second wave of punk popularity into the mainstream. By 1995-1996, the same kids who kicked my ass for having a pink Mohawk now had pink Mohawks of their own. A punk rock civil war of sorts broke out, as my friends and I took up arms against the newly self-identified punkers, with both sides accusing the other of being posers.
As a teenager, I’d once again found myself on the cutting-edge. I was spending the night at my friend Mike’s house, when he suggested that we watch wrestling. I’d not watched wrestling in years, mainly because it had gotten too cartoonish for my punk rock sensibilities. But since I was bored and nothing else was on TV, I reluctantly agreed. My expectations dropped when he tuned in to the cable-access channel. I was expecting to see the usual schlock that gets relegated to the land of infomercials. What I was assaulted by shattered my expectations of what pro wrestling was:
Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) lived up to its name, with matches featuring barbed wire, thumbtacks, fire, tables, and wild brawls through the audience with fans handing wrestlers weapons like cookie sheets, frying pans, and even plastic dinosaurs. Its homebase was a rundown bingo hall in South Philly-- the hometown connection made it all the more alluring. I sat on the edge of my seat for the next hour, mesmerized. ECW was punk rock incarnate: The bastard spawn of Rocky Horror Picture Show, Jerry Springer and slasher movies. Suddenly, wrestling was cool again, and I was hooked. Friends and family ridiculed me for “being too old to like wrestling.”
A few months later, my wrestling fan friends and I started our own promotion, staging matches in our backyards and basements. Just like in ECW, our matches involved blood and weapons. This was in 1996, long before the backyard wrestling craze plagued the nation. So I guess my friends and I can be counted among the pioneers of backyard wrestling.
The WWF would come along with it’s Attitude Era, which was basically a watered-down version of ECW. Like with punk rock, all I could do was shake my head in disgust at all of those who’d talked shit and heated on me, only to fall right in line once pro wrestling became mainstream.
It can be argued that I’m ahead of the curve even with the criminal charges. I was busted in 2003, just as US CUSTOMS was transitioning to ICE and developing a cyber crime unit -- in fact, my case was only the second or third child pornography cases investigated by the unit. I was also among the first to receive a stiff sentence for child pronography-related charges (420 months).
Currently, I am leading the way for sex offenders to be treated equally. I am doing this by being outspoken and honest, all the while shattering the stereotypes associated with sex offenders by carrying myself with dignity and respect.
Some people may say I’m “tuned in”; I just consider myself being fiercely independent. If what I like becomes popular, fine. If not, I could care less-- the fact that I’m being authentic is all that matters to me."

This was the incident that compelled the CCPD and the local district attorney to issue a warrant for the arrest of the vigilante. The kid with the gun melted into his hand, this was the mayor’s son, and he had to have his entire right hand amputated. The other two teens had to endure major surgery to have the bones in their ankles separated from each other. The criminals became the victims. The public wanted the vigilante to be held accountable.
Vicky, working for her grandfather’s law firm, saw how she could fix the situation for everyone involved. She took the initiative to track down the vigilante, which was difficult within itself, and over the course of a few weeks, was able to win his trust. She worked out a deal with Steven, the vigilante’s real name. He would now work with the CCPD, and only have to pay restitution for the three teens’ medical bills.
Vicky provided him with an entirely new makeover: a sleek, new black, bulletproof, lightweight superhero suit, a state-of-the-art hoverboard, and a formidable name -- Black Fusion. After thwarting a coordinated 12-man terrorist plot against thousands of citizens, Black Fusion became the golden boy of Central City and an international celebrity.
As much as she tried to keep things between them purely professional, and as many times as she deflected Steven’s attempts to ask her out on a date, eventually Vicky couldn’t deny the chemistry between them. Within the span of a year, Steven and Vicky had become the embodiment of passion, love, and lust. To Vicky, it felt like they had become each other’s world, and nothing nor anyone could interfere with that.
And then Steven (as Black Fusion) met Stacy Catcher -- the gorgeous, green-eyed news anchor from one of the major morning news shows. Steven had gotten caught up in his celebrity so much that it caused Vicky and him to fight and argue constantly. After Steven, in full superhero mode, was photographed kissing Stacy Catcher on his hoverboard, it was over between him and Vicky.
As she stared out of the big conference room window, Vicky daydreamed and reminisced until the very thought of him sickened her. She thought and she plotted. He was nothing without her. She made him into what he was. And if she chose so she could rightfully undo him. She knew his strengths and contemplated his weaknesses. Black Fusion was a product made from her own imagination. And she could make something more powerful, something more worthy of her own name.
She thought and she plotted. Soon, Central City would be hers."

Change takes fierce motivation, practice, and repetition. The science of ti almost guarantees most of us will fail.

The reality is there are countless men out there challenging the very nature of their being; constantly changing themselves for the better and reaching all-new levels of success.

These years can’t be given back that you’ve wasted. These years had gotten worse as your addiction continued after little breaks. Now where are you? Prison. You’ve been in prison a long time, even before you landed in a cell. You were in prison to yourself, the past. Your soul and spirit were so broken. You didn’t know who you were. Instead, you seeked men and tried to find your self-esteem and worth, and even tried to please and rescue them--not such a good idea. You didn’t know where to seek to find what you were looking for, and you pushed away the people that truly love and care about you.
Was prison a curse or a blessing? A blessing: it saved your life. We will never know where you would be if you never came to prison. Maybe death could have claimed you--it tried to before. You’re sober and getting to know yourself. Self-discovery has been an amazing journey. Your spirit is starting to heal, and now self-love is developing within. Beauty is regaining back. Each day you’re growing spiritually and repairing relationships. You’re going through an amazing transformation!
This little prayer has helped me: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference -Amen-
Now, my life is slowly coming together. The future is bright. I want you to remember the path you came from / the powerlessness you have. I use to be empty, now I am filled with the Holy Spirit.

She softly shrugged her shoulders. She eyed her drink for a moment, then looked up at him. “I guess, In this big ‘ol world, anything Is possible, really.”
Marcus was trying to figure out how much to reveal to her. He didn’t want to scare her away. He had come too far. “Do you like stories, Charlene?” he asked her. “I’ve got a story that I know you’d appreciate.”
Before Charlene could respond, Marcus was leaning back In his chair, hand around his glass of cold beer, and off Into his story: “There was a man who lived a very unique life, or should I say, very unique lives. The thing that was different about this man Is that you know how some people can recall, In detail, each day of their lives by pure memory? Well, this man could recall every life he’s ever lived. Every reincarnation. The bodies he inhabited were different, In different periods of time. From a fishmonger In the pre-Crusade era of south Persia to a knight of the First Regency In the mid-1500s of royal Spain. Although each life was disrupted by the moral affliction that we all suffer from, his memory lived on, uninterrupted, from lifetime to lifetime. And for every lifetime his number one goal was not to be rich or famous or powerful, but It was to find that singular everlasting connection with his soulmate.
In every lifetime he would find her. In every single one. It didn’t matter how unlikely their connection would be, with the hurdles of class or custom or social rank between them. And It didn’t matter, the distance, what measure of land or expanse of sea, he would always, always find her. Although she looked completely different, physically, In every lifetime, the charity of her spirit and the endowment of her soul were always the same. True beautiful.”
Charlene was leaning forward, with her elbow on the table as her chin rested slightly In the palm of her hand. The way that she stared at him, taking In every single word, made him feel as If It was all coming together.
Marcus continued on: “With this man’s dedication and devotion, you would think that their bond would have a fairy tale ending, but there was always something that went awry. Either a war or a tragedy would separate them. And there were times when the folly of their youth could not overcome the opposing forces that they had to fight through, endlessly, just to stay together. In all of the lifetimes they shared, they never had the opportunity to grow old with each other. Not one.”
“That’s soooo sad,” Charlene said, shaking her head and turning her gaze to the floor. The band was now playing a slow, bluesy tune.
“So the man made a vow to himself,” Marcus continued, emphasizing with his index finger gently jabbing at the table. “He said ‘next lifetime, I’m telling her everything from every life time we’ve ever lived together so she’ll know what I know.’ Because he’s the only one that remembers It all, so he figured that will make a difference. To finally give them a chance to grow old together.”
Marcus leaned closer over the table. “And so, Ms. Charlene, this Is why I’m telling you this-so this lifetime will be different… different for us.”
Charlene stared at him, frozen unsure of what to say next or how to say It. It would break his immortal heart If Marcus knew that she had started to remember her past lives three lifetimes ago, and that what she remembered of their past two lives together was unlike anything of the romantic conjuring that he remembered. She had started falling out of love with him 600 years ago.
Marcus stared into her eyes, hopeful, feeling that this time would be different. Charlene looked out past his gaze, wishing eternity wasn’t such a long, long time."

We go to the mall Starbucks and get her a grande Passion Iced Tea Lemonade. I get the venti size.
My sister wants a frosty and to go to the zoo. The week before we went to Wendy’s. She did like the frosty. Usually, I have a no food rule in my car. Since it’s her birthday, I let her eat the frosty in my car. I tell her not to make a mess in the car.
We spend a couple of hours at the zoo. We go to the petting zoo section. She gets to pet a rabbit and gets to feed a baby goat.
She’s hungry so we go to the zoo food court. I buy some chicken nuggets with fries. The drink comes in a pink container shaped like an elephants head.
I ask my sister if she wants to go home. She says she wants to go play golf and race cars. We drive over to speed zone. We buy some mini golf and go-cart tickets. We play some mini golf for a while. Then we get on the go-cart track. Speed zone has two tracks, the slick course and the regular course. We ride both tracks a couple of times.
My sister is finally exhausted and wants to go home. As soon as I put her in her car seat, she instantly falls asleep."

Now I’ve seen Amityville Horror. When I hear a voice tell me something in such a manner, I listen. Darn tooting!
So I put on my light blinker and change lanes. As I get in the outside lane I barely miss hitting a biker picking themselves up off their wrecked bike lying in the inside lane. I never saw this person at all in my headlights until I was actually beside them and passing. I would have hit them and probably run completely over them as they were centered in the right lane and in the process of getting up.
Who would’ve believed I hadn’t been able to see this person and avoided this accident? We’re in the middle of a lighted city.

She comes back and jabs me with four needles. That made me groggy after a few minutes. I think I might have been a little delirious because I remember getting in the elevator and forgetting why I was in the elevator. I was having a flashback to that movie The Believers, where spiders lay eggs in their victims which then hatch out of the victim’s body. The medical officer had to lure me out with a peanut butter cup. Then, I think I passed out. By the time I woke up, it was morning and Rasta Doc was prodding me. He didn’t seem too startled by my immediate screaming “Don’t touch that!”
Hmm….. I thought, this might be a little serious since Rasta is here on a government holiday. He just went tsk, tsk, tsk, and ordered the nurse to take me to the surgical room. There he informed me I would have to be cut and drained. Okay, okay, just cut me Doc, because by this time I was in agony. The swelling made my body feel like I was being bathed in scorching lava. Thank goodness he numbed me up. Slice. And then something really terrible gushed forth. Let’s just say it was beyond foul. The situation wasn’t helped by me throwing up everything I’d eaten for the past ten years.
I had to stay in the infirmary. They had to clean the wound every few hours because the bandages would become drenched. I was a leaking superfund site. Plus it had to be stripped and packed several times every day. The nurses all had a turn squeezing me like the Blueberry Girl from Willy Wonka. Nurse Houlihan remarked I would have an interesting scar. I said “When I’m asked about this, I’ll just say I was shanked by the medical staff. Don’t mess with them!”
My friends were worried about me. You could hear me screaming every day all the way outside of the building “Don’t touch that! AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!” In this matter I was not shy. You’d think I’d never experienced pain but I assure you that I have been through natural childbirth, twice. This was worse.
My friend Marina with whom I share books sent two Sci-Fi’s up to me, David Wong’s In the End Dave Dies and the sequel This Book is Full of Spiders, Don’t Touch it. The latter being about interdimensional spiders which hatch out of your brain and run amok eating people. Of course she did it just so I could keep my mind off the pain of my own arachnoid troubles.

Soaked in blood
I’m not weak

I only kill
So I can eat
I smell
I know
How to live
But if I could
I’d never be
What I am here and now
I am a wolf

Both of us, having been born in northeastern Florida, didn't quite know what to make of all of the cold, white stuff all over the ground, not that it should serve to diminish another of our extended journeys of exploration. At the end of the suburban street, 'Mount Airy Road,' upon which our house was situated, was a wooded area that had previously escaped our attention as a possible avenue of investigation, until the absence of leaves (another foreign artifact of the winter season in northern U.S.) made it so that we could see past the previously dense foliage and into what appeared to be a new neighborhood to survey. So, down the road and off through the woods we went, into what turned into a quagmire of ice, mud and thickets of brush, still bearing their thorns and 'wait-a-minute' vines. As Toddy was breaking trail ahead, I was keen to follow, despite being now water-logged and cold as any transplanted young Floridian had ever conceived of being. After we emerged on the other side of the wooded area, another nice suburban area was before us, and we walked the street a few blocks to try and find a way back wherein we wouldn't have to traverse the dark, wet forest wilderness again.
After winding through what seemed like a maze of streets and drives, 'we' decided it was time to submit to the embarrassing concept of requesting assistance from a local resident. I am still amazed that the lady upon whose door I knocked was willing to take into her home a clearly alien, four year old youth, still with what must have been to her a clearly alien sounding Southern accent, and his totally soaked, muddy and briar encrusted canine crony. As soon as this benevolent soul had provided me some warm and dry hand knit woolen socks, she summoned the local police to arrange for Toddy's and my return to home base. The gravity of the situation had completely escaped us, but Mom believed otherwise and I was unable to convince her that it was totally Toddy's idea, and I was just along to keep him out of trouble, or to prevent his being shot again in his incessant lifelong quest for the widespread distribution of his genetic material. The vet bills from having to extract birdshot from his butt must have been crazy expensive.
I have to wonder how many of Toddy's great-great-great... grandchildren are still walking the earth, causing havoc and mayhem in the accompaniment of some young adventurer. Given that the contemporary trend of neutering pets may have severed some of Toddy's line of descendants, I can't help but believe that with as much of his life was devoted to procreation, that his lineage could possibly be missing from the planet. Surely somewhere there are 'next-gen' Toddy's around the neighborhood, in search of romance and adventure. Likewise, one has to wonder from what ostentatious stock he came. When asked what kind of dog he was, frequently following one of his numerous crazy stunts, given Toddy's predisposition to jumping of climbing over or through any given obstacle, Mom would typically reply that he was, ""part Toy-Collie, part Spitz, and part monkey.""
As in those famous lines from Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' : Act III, Scene I:
""With Ate' by his side, come hot from hell, shall... Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!""
My old friend Toddy, for all of his clever antics, was clearly under the influence of 'Ate,' the Greek goddess of mischief, as Shakespeare intimated that the ghost of Julius Caesar was accompanied by, seeking his revenge on his cowardly assassins. If there is such a thing as 'dog heaven,' and, in the case that it is collocated with human heaven, I would wager that Toddy must now be in the company of such characters as Harry Houdini, Attila the Hun, Charlie Chaplin, Crazy Horse, Geronimo, Moe Howard, Nero, the Marquis de Sade, Meriwether Lewis, Sun Tzu, and undoubtedly some members of the Flying Wallenda Family. I'm sure they heard that he was coming, and lined up to get an autograph or have a selfie taken."

You are going to die. You just don’t know when. Every single thing will be taken from you. You will leave behind your possessions, your loved ones, and all your hopes and dreams for this life. You’ll be taken right out of where you are. You’ll no longer be able to fill the roles you were so busy playing. Death changes everything in a flash, that’s reality. If everything changes in an instant, perhaps they aren’t so real after all. You should look deeper.
Embracing deep truths means you don’t have to change your life; you just change how you live your life. For example, you’ve walked outside thousands of times; how many times have you really appreciated it? Imagine a person in a hospital bed who has just been told they’ve got a week to live. They ask the doctor, “Can I walk outside? Look at the sky just one more time?” If it was raining outside, they would want to feel the rain just once more. For them, that would be the most precious thing. You don’t want to feel the rain. You cover up.
What is inside of us that is so afraid that it keeps us from simply enjoying life? This part of us is so busy trying to make sure the next thing goes right that we can’t just be here now and live free. All the while, death is watching our footsteps. Don’t you want to live before death comes? You’re probably not going to get a warning. Very few people are told when they’re going to die. Almost everybody just takes a breath and doesn’t know they didn’t take another."

“See, Martha, they don’t mind,” Bob cut in while smiling and showing his yellowing teeth.
“I do believe that you could be from Alabama. Since I have traveled around all states and foreign countries prior to my retirement…”
George wanted to cut in and was about to speak when Bob threw up his hand to stop him. Bob couldn’t contain himself any longer. “Let’s just say I would love to have a Georgia peach.”
“No way,” Lauren laughed. George could hardly contain himself. They both were amazed at how he did it so quick at his age. What they didn’t know was that Bob was in a special branch of service, where he used his skills to capture some of the worst people in the world.
“I hope my mind is bright like yours when I’m your age.”
Bob stated that all it took was a loving woman and a lot of faith to make it work. Most of all don’t give up on your dreams! The two couples talked for hours and then parted their ways. George was talking about how the two must have been together forever. Laura agreed and was now feeling hunger pains.
“Mark and Linda’s apartment is only three blocks away. We can walk and enjoy the sights and fresh air,” Laura suggested to George, “Money would be tight plus tax; it would be of no use.” Eating out in a restaurant didn’t sound too appealing.
A voice rang out near the corner. It caught both of them and the aroma filled the air. They then said it at the same time. “Hot Dogs!” All was going well until George asked for mayo. The man looked at him with disappointment. The stand only had mustard, so they paid and walked off. The vendor was still talking. George couldn’t make out what he was saying, but this he knew wasn’t English. He thought he detected a few swear words. He wasn’t sure and wasn’t going back to ask.
George noticed the women comping up the sidewalk. His mind went blank. Her figure is one that most women would die for. All thoughts disappeared. Laura was still holding his hand when all of a sudden a long whistle came out. This sound not only stopped her in their tracks but also the women smiled as they walked away. The comment brought George back to where he needed to be.
“Really, really, George. He knew that trying to smooth things over wasn’t going to work.”
When he turned, it was worse than he had figured; that look would take down a runaway train. Nothing was going to connect his own selfish mistakes. Her face had one stern look, her cheeks blood red. It was her stance that told the rest.
She let go of his hand and walked on ahead to Linda’s apartment. He started to walk toward her. By now, she was a good fifty feet ahead of him. Soon she would be lost in the crowd. The only place she could go was their friends’ place. He too, knew where it was.
He was very tired once the elevator has stopped on the seventh floor. He stepped out and walked up to the door and rang the buzzer. It opened to reveal Mark. Before George could say a word, Mark said, “Really! Dude, what were you thinking? You could have lost the only woman who loves you.”
Once they talked and he told Laura he was sorry for his actions, the two worked it all out and enjoyed their time in New York. This is an example to life and how it is that most people want their cake and want to eat it. I say that just like the song goes, “If you can’t love the one you want, love the one you are with.” Life is too short to ruin a perfect relationship."

Wow. They were some of the best cookies Henry had ever tasted. As Belinda was going on about something or other, she began to nod off. Once Henry was sure that she was fast asleep, he walked over to a stroller that Belinda had used for a flower bed and dumped it onto her freshly cut lawn.
After struggling a bit, Henry got Belinda into the stroller and began pushing her towards his home. Henry noticed after a few minutes that he was feeling tired himself.
After a long yawn, Henry realized Belinda’s eyes were open and looking at him.
“Wh...what?” Henry wondered.
“Well,” Belinda began, “I remembered what type of animal you are, that you are sly and cunning. So, as I placed the cookies onto the table between us, while my wing obscured your view, I switched glasses with you.”
Then Henry remembered the sips from his drink that he took between bites. This was the first time Henry had been outwitted. Henry was fighting to keep his eyes open.
“I like you, Henry,” Belinda said, “so I regret that we must part on ill terms. But keep in mind, life is a miserable road traveled alone.
“Selfishness and deceit will always end in despair.”
Henry heard every word she spoke before he finally fell to the ground, snoring the rest of his day away."

The Bearded Lady taught me how to read and write, but Cy couldn’t even talk let alone understand letters. The Clowns would give me books and toys to pass the time. The toys were usually broken the first time Cy got ahold of them so he wasn’t allowed to touch the books. The Other’s kids would sit outside our cage each night while I read to them and Cy until he fell asleep. Even though I was in the cage I still felt like a part of the Others.
As the years passed and we grew older things got easier for me and harder for Cy. He kept getting sick and his eye would swell shut for days. I could tell that he was in constant pain from his sinuses when he would pull on his ears and hold his head. During the night he would wake up choking and gasping because he had rolled onto his back in his sleep. If we had a mean crowd then he would whimper and cry in his sleep ‘til he woke up screaming and howling.
They say “Man inspires literature and literature inspires man” and I fully believe that. I have been The Creatures that Mary Shelly wrote of. I have experienced the fear and paranoia of “Crime and Punishment,” and understand the mercies of George when it came to Lenny.

“Not a chance.”
He dashed out of the store with the soup and crackers toward his house with the goose in the pram. They made it to his lair with his wife. His wife said, “Looks like the goose is cooked.”
The goose struggled for a moment; then, with all her might, she got her wings freed. “Thank heaven. Keep the crackers.”

She looked slightly confused when she answered, “Yes, I do.”
“I have something for you.” I grabbed the cake and the quarters from my motorcycle. I then sat down beside her and handed it all to her. I asked for her name, and she told me it was Allison. I told her that I had been hailing from a really bad day, but thanks to her, that had all changed. I told her if more people would focus on what they do have instead of what they don’t, the world would be a much better place. She just grinned and took another bite of cake.
I don’t think Allison will ever know how much she touched my heart that day. I thanked her for helping me to see that my day wasn’t so bad after all. There were tears streaming down my face as we leaned together for a selfie. I’ll never forget her. I wonder if she had any cake lately?

The lake was a mere 2 mil drive and the “Fine & Feather Club” did not open their gates until 6:00am, but we knew from past experiences that fellow anglers who lived over the hills in the San Fernando Valley had arrived by dawn of the previous day in order to get a prime camping spot. As expected, there were nearly 40 campers, cars, and trucks (many hauling boats behind them) in line ahead of us. By 5:00am, a club employee went from vehicle to vehicle checking to make sure that everyone had a valid fishing license and that their club fees were up-to-date. At 6:00am sharp, the gates swung open and the caravan of awaiting vehicles all started their engines like the drivers at Daytona did every February.
Our father decided upon the long, L-shaped wooden pier near a boat ramp. All of us boys eagerly grabbed our poles and tackle boxes and scampered down to the end of the pier. I began my morning spincasting; a technique of throwing your line out with a lure of some sort and slowly reeling it back in, hoping for a “strike”. My tackle box was loaded with all sorts of tackle: swivels, weights, bobbers, pliers, fillet knife, premade leaders, different size hooks, bug spray, salmon eggs, blood bait and zekes floating bait. I chose a Mepps “Black beauty” lure. With a snap of my wrist, I allowed 30 yards of line to sail through the dewey morning air carrying the Mepps lure along with it. The lure hit the lake with a light “plunk” sound and I allowed it to sink below the surface approximately 10 feet before I began slowly reeling it back in, I could almost envision the lures spinner as it spun through the clear water like the rudder of a submarine. What trout could possibly resist?
“Wham”! My ultralight Garcia pale bent into the shape of an upside down U. I caught a fish on my first cast. I was somewhat miffed. However when I reeled it in, I discovered that it wasn’t that big. I kept it reluctantly. The limit is 5 trout per fisherman. My intention was to get me 5 big, plump trout who had been spending all off-season getting fat and sassy for me. I hooked the “stocker” onto my stringer and cast again. The fish were biting alright, but I wanted a bigger fish. So I removed my lure and added a 2 ft leader, treble hook, and a gob of “zekes” garlic flavored cheese floating bait. I used a pretty big weight so that I could cast much further out, into deeper waters where I suspected the “lunkers” were lurking. My brother Dennis had already set his line and was now “skipping” rocks on the shore side of the pier. I placed my pole in its holder which was secured to the pier with a “vice-like” clamp and began checking on my fellow anglers who spread themselves all down the length of the pier. Most families already had stringers loaded with rainbow trout. By noon, the bites had slowed down. I went to go check my bait and when I got back to my position, I discovered that my brother Dennis’ pole was no longer sitting in the pole holder, it was gone. His tackle box was right where he had left it, but his fishing rod was gone baby gone! Maybe he had taken it and was spincasting I surmised. In any case, I went looking for him.
I found him on shore looking for more flat rocks to skip on the water. I asked about his pole and he said that he’d left it in its holder. He didn’t really seem to care one way or the other and so I went back to tend to my spot. When I got back, I discovered that I had a bite. My pole was bouncing up and down like crazy. Adrenaline coursed throughout my body. With shaky hands, I snatched up my pole and began battling with the monster at the end of my line. I let out some drag so that the fish would tire soon. Slowly my spindle once again began to fill with line, I had to be close! Suddenly, I saw my swivel and leader appear from the deep blue water. My heart sank when I noticed that there was no fish on my hooko. I did however manage to snap someone else’s line. I grabbed the line and began pulling it manually. From the depth, I saw another fishing pole. It was Dennis’ pole! I pulled it out of the water and began reeling his line. I quickly surmised that he had perhaps snagged his line on a log or something because as I reeled it in, it felt heavy but with no resistance as would be the case with a fighting trout. But it “was” a trout. A very large, very exhausted trout. I reeled it in, grabbed my net and scooped it up and onto the pier. It was a whopper. 18” long and almost 3’. That was a beast of a fish, a rare beauty here at the “Fin and Feather Club”.
This is a true story. A story that has become a part of our family lore. A real “fish” story that isn’t fishy at all. Believe it or not?...."

I “collected” from people who must have thought that cocaine was free and I also became an “appraiser” of sorts. Many dealers have to settle for an endless stream of merchandise as payment. I was responsible for setting an equitable price on this merchandise. I was living ""La Vida Loca"". I had an unlimited supply of powder cocaine at my disposal and an endless line of desperate women willing to do anything I asked for a few lines. I left Jacque and this twenty-four hour a day party had become my new life.
Dave called me up to his “office” one day and told me that he had a new “assignment” for me. Dave sat me down, pulled out five thousand dollars and forty-two grams of cocaine and told me that it was mine as long as I “got rid” of his wife Becky. Without hesitation, I scooped up the payment and told him I’d take care of it that very day. I went downstairs and asked Becky to go on a few errands with me. We went to a local watering hole called the Ponderosa, ordered a pitcher of beer and then I told her about my “contract” with Dave. Of course, I had no intention of carrying out such a grisly act and explained that I was on my way to Chicago and that I would give her half of everything as soon as she told where I could drop her off safely, far, far away from Dave. Becky was afraid. Not of me, but for the fact that Dave had actually wanted her dead. She told me that her sister lived in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho and Dave had never met her. So we began the journey eastward across the state of Washington.
We decided to stop for the night in Spokane. We rented a nice room at a nice hotel and Becky showed me the gratitude she felt for saving her life."
