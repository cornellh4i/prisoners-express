**On a Hill by J.C. Holeman**

There once was a house upon a hill. No lights were on, the cupboards were bare, it seemed as if no one lived there.

And up upon that desolate hill the house stood proud, yet stark raving still.

Deep inside the fire was out, coldness dwelt where a ghost moved about.

Empty of bedding or any respite, the spirit lived alone, vanishing more every night.

And memories served the phantom with care, filling it with loneliness and despair.

Then a traveler came and unlocked the door,

He went right in and sat on the floor.

He heard the ghoulâ€™s sadness and sought in mercy, to take away each ounce of its madness.

And tossing a match into a fire He lit up the house, not for a funeral pyre.

Grasping the ghost the traveler looked in, and told the spirit

Let it be new and begin again
