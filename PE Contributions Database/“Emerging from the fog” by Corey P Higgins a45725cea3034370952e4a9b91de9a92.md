**“Emerging from the fog”** by Corey P. Higgins

When the fog left the mind the past and troubles kicked in, walking around with a grin, never letting anyone in. Praying for it all to end never letting anyone see you fall, for this is all in the family.

Some can be the worst of the worst and still call themselves family, who’s got my back, it’s all an act just waiting for the time to come to an end, even when I sit behind the “Door” thinking of only war but knowing it's wrong.

Hoping it’ll change within 8 months of this Door I’ll change my mind and get back to doing my time, maybe even find some peace, if and only they would give me my art supplies then I could feel alive. They say no more “I-con” in this state, so they changed its name and now here I sit. I quit going to the “Bird Cage”,  they fear opening my trap, never knowing if it’s a trap or if I just want to chat.

Better to laugh at the walls missing the fog, was I in the wrong? Maybe my mind is still in the fog.
