**"Simple Pleasures" by Clyde O. Jr. Pittman**

There are a lot of things in life that we overlook when it's easy to come by. Simple things that bring us pleasure, even when it doesn't seem important. In the current situation I find myself in, incarcerated locked in a cell even the smallest things you miss. Just the thought of being imprisoned should bring up some of life's simple pleasures that are not available.

This should not be taken as a "hand reaching out for sympathy," but as true feelings and emotions of a person who is subjected to life's ups and downs. One of life's simple pleasures I so miss the most is being able to see family and friends when I want to. The smile from a familiar face, a voice so soothing it can only be from motherly love.

Also love from your girlfriend or wife that only they can give you. Just to be free, come and go as you please, without the watchful eye of a man over you in a gun tower. To breathe fresh air, feel the rays of sunlight, see the birds in the sky and enjoy the shade of a tree. The feeling of being close to someone when it rains, but when it rains it pours. How we take for granted the things that mean so much to ourselves and the ones we love.

There are so many things I miss, simple pleasures that only come with freedom. To be independent, work to accomplish goals, to make dreams come true. To be able to get in a car and drive without any particular destination. Just moving along seeing the world and the people in the world. There is nothing more enjoyable than having a clear mind and being free from the stress of confinement.

Simple pleasures can be a lot of things, the smell of a good cooked meal on the stove. A good old fashion hamburger or piece of pizza, in my situation you would pay top dollar for something so simple. I dream about heading out to the lake with a fishing pole to relax and enjoy the day. To simply relax on the couch and enjoy your favorite television show, all are simple pleasures I do miss.

One of life's simple pleasures I see so many take for granted is, "to bring a child into the world." I have yet to experience how it feels to be a father, "to have helped to create a life." I know with fatherhood comes great responsibility, but what can be greater than love and endless possibilities. That you can raise a child to be or help them accomplish their full potential and dreams. In the end take life with a strong hand and don't take anything for granted no matter how small.
