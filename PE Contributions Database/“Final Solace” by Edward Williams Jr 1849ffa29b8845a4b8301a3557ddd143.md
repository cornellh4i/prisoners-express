**“Final Solace” by Edward Williams Jr.**

Liz peered forlornly out of the tall window, silently wondering how many of the inhabitants of her favorite city in the world knew that they were about to perish. Yet 37 hours and the hateful, mile-wide chunk of iron and carbon, burning with fire, would obliterate these beautiful buildings in an instant.

One tear, then two, escaped her soft green eyes as she watched her city bustle, pining over the magnificent marvels of human architecture. These buildings, her favorite in the world, would all fall, all of them: her coveted cafe, the tower on whose roof she had first been kissed by Jason, and even the little pink house with the annoying yapping dow out front … all gone.

Liz sighed, knowing she’d have to leave soon. She’d eat a final cinnamon croissant at her cafe of old and then depart for the airport, boarding a plane to Kyoto, the only place that would remain safe from the coming calamities. And she would remain silent the whole time, being forbidden by the seer to tell a soul. Yet deep inside, as she looked at the city marked for death, she wanted to scream for them to flee, run, evacuate the beautiful metropolis.

But that was tomorrow. For now, Liz would gaze unblinkingly at her home, transfixed by nostalgia, a final solace before the noise, a brief calm before the flash of light swept everything away.
