**“Normal Weddings” by John Naylor**

I recognize the word “normal” is subjective. And the majority isn’t really what influences individual feelings, opinions or perspectives. So it’s hard to say what a “normal wedding” really is. There was a saying on “the X-Men” franchise. “People change, but mutants…” Deep breath now, all types of people can relate to “the X-Men.”

Some may wonder where they fit in to the analogy. Let’s focus on similar ground. Cake and hopefully an open bar or other party favors. The people getting married realize statistics show most marriages end in divorce, especially when they marry young. Though that institution really seems necessary to our country’s structure and raising our future leaders. Though I hope that any parent makes a concentrated effort to show children love, acceptance and helps mold their children. Even if their baby’s mom is neurotic or somewhere else on some spectrum. We all need love.

The good news is it’s apparently easier for people to be themselves now days. So what you see may be exactly what you get. Being different or odd may help in developing inner strength and a stubborn streak a mile wide. In my University class at A.C.U. Dr. Tony Morrow used to remind us “If you can’t feel the current, you’re not going against the stream.” Be at one with your convictions. It builds perseverance and character. God has a plan and purpose for your life. Life is a journey, not a destination.
