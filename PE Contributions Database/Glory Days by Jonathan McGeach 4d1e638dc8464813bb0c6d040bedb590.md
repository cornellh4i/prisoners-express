**Glory Days by Jonathan McGeach**

Those were the days. Carefree. Single. No kids, no bills, no mortgage to worry about. I remember when Joanne and I would skip out of gym class last period and head downtown. She would take off her shirt and wear just that short jean jacket, even when it was cold out. I would change into something showing lots of cleavage that my parents would have killed me over. She would smoke, I would just watch. We stood right on the corner like a pair of street hookers. Little did they guess we were a pair of virgins. She was waiting for the perfect man and I was waiting for…

Those days were short-lived and before I knew it, Joanne was married way too soon to some jock from the next town over and I was waiting for…

That asshole beat her senseless, broke a couple ribs, but once he smacked the baby, she finally picked up the courage to leave him. Still beautiful and young, she married an older man with money and consistency. He treated her well, but was a bit too overbearing. I hardly ever saw my best friend. Her husband, Jerry, didn’t feel comfortable with Joanne hanging out with single women, saying it just wasn’t natural to be single at my advanced age. And I was hardly in my 20’s when he started saying this. As for me, I was waiting for…

10 years later, Jerry dumped Joanne and the three kids for the younger, prettier babysitter. He pays the child support, but has no sense of commitment. After that, Joanne could no longer deal with men. Still beautiful at 30, Joanne brought her kids to live with me. Spending my 20’s single was worth it to spend the rest of my life with my long-time best friend and brand-new lover.
