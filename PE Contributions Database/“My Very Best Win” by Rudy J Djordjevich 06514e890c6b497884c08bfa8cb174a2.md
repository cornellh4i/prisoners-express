**“My Very Best Win” by Rudy J. Djordjevich**

When the pistol was fired, the race was on. The odds were already against me, maybe a million to one, but natural instinct and tenacity have prepared me for this moment since I can’t even remember. I see maybe hundreds of thousands of my opponents in the race are already ahead of me. Most of them have a head start, but I wouldn’t allow this to discourage me. I refused to give up, so I pressed on. Through my mind I knew that only one of us can win, even though everyone around me wants this just as badly as I do. With my destination in my soul, I go as fast as physically possible.

I see trouble ahead when many in the race start to get slow, as if they are getting weaker, like some type of force is choking them out till they desist to move on. A lot of my opponents that seized to carry on were as close as family to me, but I progressed forward aggressively with fervent devotion to winning in mind.

The race track leads us up a slender tunnel. The finish line is getting near. The lead is getting even slimmer when many have started to veer off course. Some tend to start crashing into the wall and can’t seem to comprehend their sense of direction.

The lead trickling down to only a few, and under fortunate grace I am still one of the few. I can hear millions more of my adversaries behind me, and so I entertain no thought in my mind that says it is okay to start slowing down. We pass through a hollow passageway and get a first glimpse at the finish line. At this point of the race, every cell I have burns and aches, but with the finish line in my sight, it’s like I was given a second wind.

There's only one participant ahead of me at this point, and I give it everything left inside of me. I start to gain up to him till we are side by side. The finish line is getting so close I can almost taste it. By the looks of it, it is going to be a photo finish. The other guy tries to ram into me in a desperate attempt to knock me off course and gain back the lead, but I keep my control. I try to ram him back, and now we are practically going at it like a pair of vicious Siamese twins. I have worked too hard. Once I felt him shoving into me hard, I quickly slip under him. With the absence of my force equaling his, he loses control and starts to hydroplane. I would have loved to look back to see him crash, but the rest of my life was just ahead of me.

I plummeted head first into the gamete, thrusting myself inside with such intrepid excitement. The excursion is over. I will live out the next nine months in utero. My cells transforming from zygote, embryo, fetus to newborn.

Then on the eighth month in the year of 1990, the cozy, little home I lived in my whole life will be invaded by a light that blinds me. Since my eyes are immature and incapable of seeing, a masked figure will use this chance to grab a hold of me by the back of my neck and extract me unwillingly.

The unexpected coldness of the air envelope me, and oxygen was consuming me. I kicked and squirmed to break free, but the masked man just held me suspended in air as if he was taunting me. The man brandished a large pair of sharp scissors in front of my face as another clamps my lifeline shut. Then with the gruesome looking shears, he severed me completely from my mother and my home. The room was full of smiles as I was suffering the cruel, unwanted raid. I couldn’t help but cry.

Welcome to life: this is what I won from the race nine months ago against millions of my potential sisters and brothers. I guess from that point, I began to hold some type of angst toward the world for ripping me out my comfort zone. I felt that the world owed me something, and I was going to take it at any means necessary. I resented life and gambled with it everyday, taking my winnings for granted and not understanding that I also won the lottery when I was placed in the arms of my mother.

My very first winning in life was the most important one. It paved the way for many more winnings in life to even have a possibility. Life can easily be forgotten as a reward for the strenuous feat we had to endure, just to be able to breathe the very air around us. So before you start to feel like a loser or worthless at times, remember that in a million to one, you can come out the winner.
