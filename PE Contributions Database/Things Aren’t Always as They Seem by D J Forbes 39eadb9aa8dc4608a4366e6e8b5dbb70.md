"Things Aren’t Always as They Seem" by D.J. Forbes

My heart skipped a beat the moment I laid eyes on her. Then it skipped another one. Damn, my medication-induced myocardium arrhythmia!

I took another look at her after my heart started beating normally again.

At first glance, she was just some young woman lounging on the bench across the quad from me. Dressed in what today’s youth consider fashionable, she lay indolently on her stomach watching the world go by, a half-smoked cigarette held negligently in her right hand.

But it was the cigarette that gave her away.

Not once did she take a drag from it while I watched, and even though it produced a steady stream of smoke its tip, its length never changed.

That’s when I realized I was looking at a well crafted illusion.

Most people in this world of ours don’t believe that things like ghosts, ghouls, and vampires could possibly exist, that anyone who claims to have seen one must just have an overactive imagination or something.

Well, they’re wrong. Take it from me, there are things that go bump in the night.

Since we were the only two around, I surmised that she must be keeping an eye on me.

But why?

I scoured my mind for an answer, but none was forthcoming. Sure, I’ve pissed off more than my fair share of creatures and beasties over the years, but none as of late.

If knowledge is power, then by the same reasoning ignorance must be a weakness. And in the circles I run in, weakness usually equates to dead. That’s why I decided to take a look at the sight.

The sight is an ability that people with magical talent possess. It strips away illusions and glamours allowing one to see things as they actually are.

It comes at a price, though. Once seen, it stays in your memory as fresh as the moment you saw it, forever. And I’ve seen things that have made me want to claw my own eyes out, so it’s not something I choose to do lightly.

But by not using it, I could be putting myself in mortal danger.

Closing my eyes, I activated the sight by concentrating on the Third Eye Chakra located between my eyebrows. I felt the subtle shift in perception and opened my eyes. The world jumped out at me in surreal sharpness, a kind of super 3-D quality, sans pesky glasses.

Keeping my eyes averted, I prepared myself. Finally ready, I looked over and gasped in surprise.

I no longer saw the reclining woman. Instead, standing in front of the bench was the illusion’s source. She stood over six feet tall dressed in a knee-length Greco Roman tunic belted at the waist. A sword in an ornate scabbard rested on her left hip. The elbow joints of her furled wings poked out over her shoulders. Except for her constantly roving glacial blue eyes which seemed to take everything in, she stood preternaturally still.

And I realized that she wasn’t one of the things that go bump in the night.

She was something that kicked the butts of things that go bump in the night.

Now, I don’t know who would send a guardian spirit to watch over me, but I was grateful for it. These were dark and troubled times for me.

Noticing my gaze upon her, she gave me the barest of nods acknowledging that she knew that I knew what she was. Returning her nod, I then closed my sight.

Gravelly, footsteps from behind warned me of someone’s approach. I casually glanced over my shoulder to ascertain who, or what, was approaching but was unable to without turning completely around. My heart started thumping in my chest after noticing the guardian spirit’s illusion was gone.

Stars and stones! What could this be to frighten off such an imposing spirit so readily? I braced myself for whatever might come.

“Mister Butcher, time for your medication,” came a singsong voice from behind.

I allowed myself to relax slightly realizing I wasn’t about to be eviscerated, but that didn’t mean I was out of danger.

“I keep telling you,” I exclaimed, “I don’t need any medications.”

“Come now Mister Butcher, we’ve had this discussion before,” she said stepping around to stand directly in front of me, a tiny clear medication cup filled with a myriad of different colored pills in one hand and a dixie cup with water in the other. Smiling she continued, “We can do this the easy way,” the smile disappeared and her voice dropped to a register known to frighten little children and small animals, “or the hard way. What’s it going to be?”

When the guardian spirit failed to rematerialize and save me, I leaned back my head and opened my mouth, resigning myself to my fate.

Her smile reappeared instantly. “That’s a good boy,” she told me, first dumping the pills in my mouth and then holding the dixie cup to my lips, tipping it back slowly so I could wash them down.

I didn’t even consider checking them knowing what was coming next.

“Open up,” she instructed.

Opening my mouth, I struck out my tongue allowing her to inspect every nook and cranny. “Good job,” she told me in a tone usually reserved for obedient dogs.

I sat sullenly as she walked behind me, taking ahold of the grips of the wheelchair I sat in.

“My nose itches,” I complained as she began wheeling me back towards the buildings.

“Well don’t you worry now, I’ll have you back in your room and out of that jacket in a jiffy. Then you can scratch your nose all you want.” She made a sharp right, heading for the high-security wing of the Beta Foo Mental Asylum. “Then maybe you can work on one of those fanciful stories you like to write.”
