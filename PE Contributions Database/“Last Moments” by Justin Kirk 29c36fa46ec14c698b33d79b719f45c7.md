**“Last Moments” by Justin Kirk**

If you knew your life was over, that this was the last moment and you would not live to see another sight, would you want to know it was coming or would you prefer to die instantly? She looked out of her window, a view she had loved all these years in New York, and it wasn’t the same. Everything was different. Like a fleeting glimpse of something already lost to you.

The tears were already dry. She didn’t bother fixing her makeup. What would be the point? No one would ever see her again. She could still hear Daniel’s words, his cries and that last, “I love you.” She knew it would be the last time she heard him say it and perhaps that was the thing she’d miss the most about her life. Life was one of those things she had taken for granted, like the rest of the world. Living from day to day lost in our own moments and so oblivious to the plight of others. Well, at least until we see some horrific tragedy on television and feel compelled to do our due share. Like a twenty-dollar check that we mail off to St. Judes and talk about to everyone who will listen about how amazing we are as human beings. She was like that and it sucked knowing that there wasn’t enough time left for her to be more than what she was in those last moments.

She wondered if it would be some young girl much like herself who found her remains after the dust had settled and what they would say when they found her. “We got one.” Is that what her life would be categorized as? “We got one?”

Daniel had cried so much. He said the missile would strike New York in seven minutes. Seven minutes seemed like forever and then the phone went dead. Daniel worked in Washington. She didn’t even bother turning on the T.V. What was the point? She would rather just sit here, where she and Daniel had sat many nights, where Daniel had asked her to marry him and where she had said “Yes.”

Seven minutes seemed like forever and life seemed like a glimpse.
