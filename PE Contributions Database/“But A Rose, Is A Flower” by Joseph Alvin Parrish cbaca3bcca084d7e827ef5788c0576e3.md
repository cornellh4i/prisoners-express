**“But A Rose, Is A Flower” by Joseph Alvin Parrish**

I sent you a bouquet of roses,

I guess you did not receive it?

And so, I think that I must tell you

And I really mean it.

A flower is the next best thing

To receiving love, care, and appreciation.

And so just receive my bouquet of roses

All of my theme-writing friends.

Although, it’s just a flower,

It’s the best that I can do.

If flowers could speak they would be saying,

“I love you, all of my theme-writing friends”.

There are many different types of flowers

Nevertheless, all of them are pretty -

Like a beautiful woman adorned in a red pretty dress.

My theme-writing friends, I send you a bouquet of roses from my heart

To yours. No other flower could ever do,  or be sufficient to say -

“Dear all of my theme-writing friends,

I love you today!”

Roses are red, and violets are blue.

I had a choice and I picked a rose for you.

And so don’t forget what these roses are meant to say.

I’ve got so much love in my heart, it’s growing everyday.

We are brothers and sisters in common and we are fighting the same same plight.

It seems as if they’re refusing to let us go.

And when we look there is no hope in sight. Again!

I give you these roses and that’s love coming from the bottom of my heart.

I hope that you receive it and start to believe it.

Tis all I can do.

But a rose is just a flower, but in my heart, it’s power and so just rejoice

That I sent you a flower.

Be blessed, everyone.
