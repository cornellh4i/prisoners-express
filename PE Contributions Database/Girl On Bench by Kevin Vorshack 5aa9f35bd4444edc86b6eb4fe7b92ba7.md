"Girl On Bench" by Kevin Vorshack

Lying on her belly across the wooden bench, head up in an almost sphinx-like pose, supported by her elbows, Lyssa mulled over the three colored bands adorning her wrist. A slight breeze caught at a small strand of her brown hair, sliding it softly along her cheek. She brushed it back with her fingertips and returned her attention to the bands.

“Hey Lyssa.”

She looked back over her shoulder. Darby Williams stood at the end of the bench. “Oh. Hey Darby,” Lyssa said as she swung her legs around and sat up. “I didn’t hear you come up.”

Darby dropped onto the bench beside her. “Yeah, well, it wasn’t ‘cause I didn’t try. You seemed all caught up in your dance bands.” Darby brought her wrist up. “I’ve got four so far.”

“Nice,” Lyssa said holding her wrist up momentarily before dropping it back onto her lap, “three for me.”

Darby laughed. Lyssa always liked hearing her friend laugh. It was always genuine, always loud, and always infectious. “What?”

Reaching over, Darby grabbed Lyssa’s banded wrist, gently lifting it while she brought her’s to match them. Releasing Lyssa’s wrist, she pointed to the matching purple ones on each wrist.

“Tom Larsen,” Lyssa laughed.

“Yep,” Darby said. “Most of the girls got one from him, but we all know who he will take. So I guess you really have two, and only three for me.”

“It doesn't matter. I wasn’t going to give it back to him for consideration anyway. It’d be funny if no girls gave him back their band.”

“Would be, wouldn’t it,” Darby agreed. “He’d probably just go to the dance himself and act like that’s what he planned anyhow.”

Lyssa started to pull her hand back, but Darby grabbed her wrist again.

“Hey, what’s this drab tan looking band and who gave it to you?”

Jerking her hand away and placing it on her lap, Lyssa covered the band with her other hand. “It’s Khaki, I think, and Jerry Rollins OFFERED it to me,” Lyssa said.

“And you accepted it?”

“What was I supposed to do? It’s not like I’m committed to going to the dance with him as long as I don’t give it back. Besides, he might’ve given out other bands. I’m sure I’m not the only one he would ask.” Except, she felt fairly certain she was the only one. She remembered the tentative, quiet use of her name, surprised to see him standing before her desk, hand held out, the band dangling from it.

She remembered the look in his eyes. Not exactly fear of rejection, though she did sense some of that. It went deeper-a hoped for relationship with someone who understood, someone who might not judge, someone whom he could confide who might need to confide in him as well. Lyssa felt no expectation from him. Jerry’s eyes changed little as she accepted the band and he wordlessly left; but they did change.

“Well, what if you are?” Darby asked.

Lyssa plucked unconsciously on the Khaki band. “What if I am what?”

Darby threw her arms up. “Duh, if you ARE the only one Jerry offered the band to. You know…What we were just talking about!”

“What does it matter, Darby? Why’re you so fixated on it?”

Fist clenched, Lyssa brought her wrist up and shook it in her friend’s face. “I’ve got three bands, Darby! Three! It’s not like Jerry Rollins is the only guy who might want to take me to the dance.”

“Geez, Lyssa, I didn’t mean…I mean…”

At her friend’s stricken look, Lyssa dropped her arm back into her lap. “Forget it darby. Just forget it.”

“But--”

“Darby, please.”

They sat quietly, Lyssa staring at the ground; and Darby, head tilted back against the backrest, looking for shapes in the clouds. “You know, he really has no friends,” Darby broke the silence. Still staring at the clouds, she continued, “he distances himself from everyone.”

“I know.”

“Don’t get me wrong. He’s not a bad looking guy.”

“No, he’s not.”

“But he is, you know, kinda standoffish.”

“We know nothing about him. He may have his reasons,” Lyssa said. She hated lying to Darby, but couldn’t say anything without letting her own secret out. Lyssa’s friends knew her mom and dad were separated and knew she lived with her mom. They didn’t know why her parents were separated.

Jerry did.

When Lyssa last got to visit her father at the Colton Federal Law, she spotted Jerry across the room. His father sat across from him in the same khaki uniform her father wore. Like her, he must’ve moved to Colton with his mom to be closer; and, like her, tried to keep his father’s incarceration secret.

Lyssa didn’t know if he’d seen her until he gave her the band for the dance.

“So, do you know what you’re going to do?” Darby asked.

“About what?”	“The dance, Lyssa.”

Lyssa’s mind raced. So many questions, so many fears, so many unknowns. How easy to skip the dance altogether. How easy to tear the bands from her wrist and trash them. As all the possibilities clogged her mind, she continued to pluck the drab, khaki band as one might pluck the strings of a harp. The band that resonated the most with her.
