**“The Final Moron” by Robert J. Richter**

We finally gassed the last moron. For years, I have been living on this shithole planet, disguised as a human. No more! Now I can return to my native planet in my native form. I am *so* sick of living among delusional, pseudo-intelligent beings. These maniacs believed in “magnetic fields.” How crazy is that? They knew all about protons and electrons but didn’t know how to think. Maybe, now that they are gone, intelligent life will evolve on Earth.
