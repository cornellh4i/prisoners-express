**“Fox Pushing a Stroller” by John Naylor**

“Did everyone seriously look this picture over?” said a social services worker. Because it was a rare moment where you’d question multiple factors. First of all where did they get a goose to a taxidermist for that goose stroller? And seeing it was likely farm-raised, it likely didn’t violate any fish or game laws. At least on that aspect.

My head is looking at the scene like a weird painting. Just searching for whatever purposes were in the photographers mind in creating such a scene. Now a fox isn’t a domesticated animal. It is a predator with wild tendencies. I’m still not sure if it’d rather eat a goose or a baby. Play sweet fox. Kind to all and a little scared of people. Until they turn their back. Of course there’s another possibility. And that’s drugs. Yes drugs like an ecstacy pill that rolled on a floor somewhere. Or this fox may have been prey to a lonely stoner looking for a friend to hang with. And as stoners do, got the fox feeling real good. Notice how the foxes eyes are nearly shut? So in which case the fox may also act on K9 instinct, trying to impregnate a goose. Which may be better than a stranger you invited over whose leg is a likely target. Guy, girl doesn’t matter to k9 weeded instincts. I’ve yet to meet a dog with perfect morals and knowledge of consent. People think this is funny. Others, not so much.

I only joke because I believe it is a well orchestrated picture. A scene set up for a cute factor. This would mean highly structured attempts while deploying what I’m calling the invisible baby technique. Yes it hones in on paternal instincts. My dad launched the idea upon mentioning a problem. Some folks get loud or disruptive in the old folks home. We’d come to encourage them as a youth group. A church function where we’d sing to them. Most I spoke to ended up being awkward – not knowing us, they seemed to take the “don’t talk to strangers” approach. So dad said to say “shhh you’ll wake the baby.” Oddly no matter how bad affliction or age affects you, there’s no forgetting waking up the baby no matter who’s or what’s happening. Because no one wants to deal with waking a baby. Even if it's only Moms complaints.

A few times it worked. Well we could say its baby christians so it's not so dishonest.

Now I think back to singing to those elderly folks we made memories. Some never get or only rarely get visits. Then they may forget them. Very sad. At times I think of an invisible baby while waiting in lines in prison. I bounce a little like I’m burping a baby. People look at me odd. I explain, invisible baby. See? Well I could chance petting that fox. Just as long as it’s chill and doesn’t awake the invisible baby. I’m not speaking out to condemn the invisible baby or the fox. Just being a realist or something.
