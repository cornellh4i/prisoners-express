**Life Studies for Accomplishment by Rodrick Finley**

We as people of colorful minds can by “speeches and pen” make people more “enlightened” to feel the vibe of something “live”, for the “freedom” of the “mind” is the process of associating in such ways that “experience, wisdom, knowledge, ideas, emotions, principles, and values” are talked about and made common with family, friends, schools, communities and universities, when we “liberate” our “minds” with “education and creative force” to “learn” or even “teach” within a daily occupation for accomplishment…

❇Motivation Moment❇

“Greetings Prisoner Express Reader,”

(Peace and blessings in a good day)

Now as I individually upon you out of the blue as though I was a shadow of casper da friendly ghost, but as a social person under heavy rotation addressing you with this written conversation of distant communication “Please do not” fret nor fall into “shockism”, but instead sit on back and observe the worder contents of a control substance known as “black ink” ✒ that’s about to portray you a piece of my smooth magnificent intellect in the natural thought of humble mind…

Well prisoner express read: It’s said be relieved from the pressure of presenting themselves before others, for philosophy directions “first” to seek the good of the mind, and then the rest will supply a person to feel “free” and “open minded” to ideas and open views…(ya feel me!)

The reason for my direct motive within this social resuméof communication, I read a paper that I researched, that prisoner express promotes and offers inmates information, education and the opportunity for self expressions in a public forum, and as well coordinates a pen pal program, and distance learning programs…

I see you are “strong” in different good activities, so I felt it would be pretty cool to vent into some creative things, can you please connect me into some of your ewer distant learning programs of human development module, world history on communications. What ever programs of social interaction and wouldn

T mind being a part of the pen pal program that prisoner express coordinates; I got a lot of good energy I write, I write around the country to different workshops, strong voices, universities, and students, I write motivational moments like I started off the letter with, and reality poetry, which I’ve place inside a demonstration of my poems as strong messages of life and reality, one called “Incarceration Nation” a glimpse of reality from the concrete and steel, my creative world of thought, the other one called “Real Strong Voices”, which I wrote back in 2005, some say I’m before my time, it's a feel to what you see what’s going on with the country today, with the youth and need the “truth” to make knowledge and wisdom to make strong progress, I hope you’ll feel the good energy when you get into the poem messages…

I write different creative formats and paint pictures with words when emerged into my freedome zone of mind…(ya feel me!)

I have been working with Dr.Stephen J. Hartnett at the University of Colorado, which he’s the head chairman and Assoc. Professor of the Communications Dept., I mentor students to different styles in creativity, a lot of the time I feature in the “Captune Words Free Thoughts” magazine, I have been working with Dr.Stephen going on 13 years now from my cell of prison, it’s great people up there in the distant program Dr.Stephen Hartnett runs. I hope I can get into some creativity at prisoner express distant programs and pen pal program, it’s a reason “why” I started this letter off with that motivational moment, Say hit Dr.Stephen at the University of Colorado on web page.

Well prisoner express reader, I’ve passed my main intention, I’m getting too close with this called “Passion In Leaders”

When inner directed “energy, self governance, leadership and responsibilities” are “nurtured” in teachers and community leaders, “inspiring” them to “act with passion and firm knowledge” for “wisdom”, while affirming their “human ability”, the changes may come toward “new development” and “progress” of shapen the world with education and strong creative minds, we as people must also wonder about a condition that “afflicts” those of the struggle and young generation who seek “education and knowledge” and what they are “aiming” for out of life, the best passionate leaders are those who are most beneficial towards others in a good way, then passion “show and demonstrate the motions of what’s in the “heart” as realness to reach a mission of a new blessing and new chapter of life with a passion of a leader…

Now as I evaporate from your presence like one of the greatest magicians and leave you clueless of my last saying, I Can only give you one loud echo which is **“POOF” I’M A GHOST,** I leave as I came (hahasmile) good day. ❇Respect and Realness
