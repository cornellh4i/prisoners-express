**“A Dark Veil Over My Thoughts” by Brian Lowe**

I should feel sad, full of grief and sorrow. Yet, all I feel is elation that it is over. Roy was a good man, that can never be denied. However, the last year of his was a real trial. For both of us. The brain cancer, the surgery, the chemo treatments. The burning away of everything that made him Roy. So no, I am not sorry that it is over. I am happy. Happy that his pain is over, the indignities, the fear. He is better off now. My only regret is that he didn’t recover before it destroyed his brain. Too much was left unsaid. Since his mind was already gone, his passing on was the next best thing.

I take it back. I do feel sad, full of grief and sorrow. I wish it would have never happened. Roy, you are gone and I have nothing but the children left. We lost the house, the car, our income. We burned through our life savings in less than six months. I shall owe for the funeral and hundreds of thousands for the hospital bills. Roy is the lucky one. He no longer has any worries. He is not the one stressing out over how to care for our children. Why am I trapped in this situation? What sick twist of fate conspired to bring this about? What God allowed this to happen? There is no such thing as fairness in life. No justice. Just misery.

Roy Junior is four, little Amy is two. How am I to explain this to them? How am I going to provide for them? We have no insurance, no place to live, nothing to fall back on. What are we going to do? I can’t do this alone. Why did you have to go Roy? Why?!? I still need you. Our children still need you. We need you. What are we supposed to do?

I am conflicted in my emotions. All I can think about is how I will be able to care for the children. What are we to do? I can’t go all Yatesian, yet I can’t make it on my own. God, if you are real, please help us. I am coming to you in our time of need. I am sending you my deep, heartfelt needs. I need you.

Never a response. Only more suffering. Life went on. Worked hard everyday, and put the children through school. Focused my life on the children. Made them my purpose in life. I had to find something to live for and it was my family. They are the only real thing in this life. The only thing that is worth continuity.

The children of the family are the true treasures worth living for. They are my higher power. Everything I did was for them. Not for an obsolete literary construct.

Life is hard for everyone. In order to be truly free you must live for this present life and the future of those who will follow. Then you will be living for something real and worth following. Not because you are afraid of displeasing a nonexistent superbeing, but because this life allows you to choose what is right. Choosing freely to care for your family against all odds without the baggage of centuries of fear mongering theological tyrants. This is true freedom.
