**“Left Bad Tail” by Abraham Divine**

****A few years ago, in 1973 in Little Rock, Mississippi, two twin girls named Jammie and Sue lost their mother in a car crash. The car crash was caused by a drunk driver. Although they were only 10 years old at the time, they understood their mother was gone. A few years later, their father remarried his high school sweetheart Elviria. Everything seemed normal to the untrained eye. When their father went to work, so did Elviria. She didn’t go to a job; she went to work on the twins by putting them down: “You two are a big thorn in your dad’s side and mine too. I hate you both. I wish you two died in that car crash too.”

One day, Jammie goes on a date with George, leaving Sue at home by herself. When Jammie returned, Elviria was in the kitchen with Sue. “I’m glad to see you,” Elviria said. “Sit down and eat your dinner, both of you.” So Sue and Jammie ate their dinner and became sleepy a few minutes later.

They went to bed with no thought of the day. Everything seemed normal, a little too normal. When Sue and Jammie woke 3 hours later, they noticed something strange. They were laying across their bed. Sue sits up and feels her hair pulled. “Stop it, Jammie!” “No you stop it, Sue!” They noticed their hair was braided together, and after more bickering, they told their every thought to their father about Elviria. The next day, Elviria was gone. Where did she go? When did she leave? To everyone’s surprise, the only man who can answer those truths or lies is John Knives.
