**“A Night Out” by Natasha Maready**

“I told you you’d like it, May!” Donnie exclaimed.

“Well yeah Donnie. It’s hoppin’ in here. Of course I like it,” said Maybelle.

What Maybelle didn’t know was that Donnie had set it up with the band for her to sing a song on stage tonight. Donnie just knew that would make Maybelle happy as a lark and then maybe he could ask her to marry him.

Maybelle watched everyone like she was trying to commit every detail to memory. Donnie was glad to see her beautiful smile. When the band picked up he asked Maybelle to dance. They danced the Charleston and the Watusi to the next two songs. Then the band leader grabbed the microphone and introduced “A lovely little gal- Maybelle Jhonstone!” As the audience clapped and hooted Maybelle’s jaw dropped. “Donnie…, did he just say…?” She was cut off by the cheese eatin’ grin that had spread on Donnie’s face.

“Oh , you did. You ‘ole polecat you!” said Maybelle. “Well baby, I guess you better get on up there.” Donnie said as he joined the rest of the crowd in applause. Maybelle walked over to the stage and grasped the band leader’s outstretched hand to step onto the stage.

“Alright sweetness,” said the man, what would you like to hear?” Maybelle asked. “Do you know anything by Miss Billie Holiday?” The bandleader said,

“of course sweetness,” and started up the band.

Now Donnie knew that May had the prettiest voice he had ever heard. He also knew that she was happiest when she was singing. But what Donnie didn’t know was the fact that in the audience that night sat Mr. Bobby Banks- the man who owned and starred in the biggest radio show around. As Maybelle finished singing her song, there wasn't one person in that club not on their feet applauding. Maybelle stepped down off the stage and headed for Donnie, grinning ear to ear. Before she could cross the dance floor, Mr.Bobby Banks was standing in front of her with his hand out to introduce himself.

“Hello there beautiful. My name is Bobby Banks. I own the Bobby Banks radio show and I believe you just may be a star.”

Something ignited inside Donnie when he saw a man stop his girl and talk to her. So he closed the gap, walked around the stranger and put a protective arm around Maybelle. As he planted a kiss on her cheek, Donnie said,

“That was the most May!” Donnie thought to himself, “I don’t like the looks of this clown.”

Almost sensing his thoughts, the man extended his hands once more; this time to Donnie. “Hiya buddy. I was just tellin’ this lovely lady that I would like her to come be on my radio show. The name’s Mr. Banks, but you may call me Bobby.”

Maybelle interjected, “Thank you Mr. Banks, but my pap would have my hide if I even suggested that I wanted to go on the radio.”

“Well honey, said Bobby, I wouldn’t wanna make your good ole pap mad, but does he know that I would pay you twenty dollars to sing on my show?”

“Well no, but I would have to ask him if it was okay.” said Maybelle.

“Fine, fine, said Bobby. Here’s the address to my radio station. Just come on down on wednesday at seven if it’s alright with your pap.” Maybelle took the little piece of paper and looked at it with round eyes as Bobby Banks walked away. Donnie- glad that he was gone- reached for the paper in Maybelle’s hand. “ Here May. I'll hold onto it until you ask pap.” She looked at Donnie with stars in her eyes, and said “ I'm gonna be a star!”

Donnie said,

“ Now wait May...” Maybelle answered,

“Wait nothin’. Donnie James Franklin, you want to marry me don’t you? Well the twenty dollars sure would help pay for it!”

Donnie sputters

“wh.. wh.. Who told you?”

Maybelle placed a hand on Donnie’s cheek lovingly.

“Nobody told me Donnie Dear . I love you and you love me. It was obvious. Well… especially after I found the ring in your coat pocket.”

Then Donnie pulled the ring out of his pocket and dropped to one knee. “May, my beautiful Maybelle, will you marry me?”

Maybelle reached for Donnie’s hand and said,

“Oh Donnie, I have to ask Pap.”
