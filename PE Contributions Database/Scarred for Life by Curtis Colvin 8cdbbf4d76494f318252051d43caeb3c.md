**"Scarred for Life" by Curtis Colvin**

When I look at this picture of the people huddled down in a wet, dirty-watered ditch, fearing for their lives, I feel their *real* terror. He isn’t “acting” for some movie camera’s film. This is real life. I would have hated to have been one of these people at this time. Frightened, tired, wet, dirty, and most of all, scarred. Scarred for life. Whatever situation put them in this predicament was a life-changing event. One wonders if they made it through this life-altering moment, and if so, where are they today? How scarred are they mentally? My other question is....who in their right mind would be in this ditch taking this picture?
