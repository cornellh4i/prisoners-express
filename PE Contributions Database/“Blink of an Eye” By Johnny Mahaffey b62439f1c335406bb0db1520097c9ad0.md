**“Blink of an Eye” By Johnny Mahaffey**

At any moment, in the blink of an eye; literally, in that sliver of a moment--everything can change.

Prisoners are constantly running games on each other, trying to get ahead or get some form of advantage over another. They take jobs just for the sake of some position that may afford them some attention that may (or may not) open doors that they can manipulate.

Prisoners are always looking out for Number One, themselves, in the end, as the years pass; each can only do their own sentence, their time. Any prisoner that tries to do the time of others gets stressed unnecessarily--there’s a balance--but, unfortunately, most choose one extreme or the other.

A healthy balance is seldom achieved.

They’ll lie, cheat, connive, and steal, to get over on one another. It can be calm and quiet one moment; and screaming-banshee-murderous the next!

In the end, our parents would NOT be proud. We would apologize, they would apologize--it would be this whole big thing--and after we’ve all toned in, we realize it’s all just a blink of the eye to this universe.
