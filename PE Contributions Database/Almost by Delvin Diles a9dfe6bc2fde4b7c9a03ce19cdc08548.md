**Almost By Delvin Diles**

****I didn’t find out that Michelle was a runaway until she moved in with us. The night I met her she was Mario’s latest girlfriend who gave us all lap dances. I was the third in line so she hadn’t even bounced on me a handful of times before I came in my pants. If she knew, she didn’t clown me for it, thankfully.

I never found out what kind of falling out she and Mario had but she ended up living with us at Ms. Mae’s house. She was a single mother with one teenage son, Paul, or as we called him, P-laya, his rap name. Our group Unda Da Influence, consisted of me (Psyco), him and Dwight (Lil’ Dee-Dee) who lived across the street but was in jail for check fraud at the time. So the teens living in Ms. Mae’s house kept the U.D.I creed strong with smoke sessions and freestyles. Michelle could sing so she fit right in on a hip-hop soul song I wrote, “Cut Up Da Phillay.” She was talented and bold. Her first night she said “I’m on my period so y’all can’t fuck me yet but I’ll suck y’all dicks.” We were cool with that.

Soon everybody in the house--Paul, Yogi, Wayne and me--got served by Michelle’s wet, loud head. I was amazed by how even at a slow pace it was audible. She off her period and then everybody banged her. Word spread, and then members of our clique a block away borrowed her for a weekend.

It was getting hard to get close to the front of the line with her. But some mornings I’d catch her in the hallway and grab her ass, kiss her when no one was around, lay behind her and caressed her skin. I would pretend she was a normal girl. In the moment it almost felt possible.
