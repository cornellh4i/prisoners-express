**Running by Roderic Pippen Sr.**

When you hear the word “Running,” the assumption is of physically running. I believe through that natural assumption, the depth of the word is lost. After reading this you will see the definition of running as I see it.

Growing up, I started out stealing cars to visit females and joyride with my friends. Eventually, it became more about money and camaraderie. Over time, the cops began to chase us, leading to us running.

One of my closest friends is Donald Jackson; he was the “fatboy” out of our circle of friends. In those days, high speed car chases were an everyday occurrence. But it was also common to get a good distance away, then ditch the car and escape on foot.

There was one unmarked car chasing us, after a near accident with a Ford Ranger. I was able to get us a good distance away, and we parked in front of an abandoned house. We ran between houses to the alleyway, down the alley to a fence leading to the backyard of the next block.

The fence was no problem for me. I jumped it and waited for Don to come over. He didn’t, so I jumped back over. This is where he claims I found superhuman strength to throw him over the six foot privacy fence. After I made it back over, we were able to walk to my uncle’s house. We got away with a small amount of running.

The next story picks up in a high speed car chase on Westbound Interstate 94 Freeway. This time, I was in the passenger seat, and Don was driving. At this time, I was the more experienced driver, so I was barking out directions. We came up behind a semi-truck, “hit the left lane and pass it, then make the exit on the right.” That was a maneuver out of the movies; surprisingly, Don was able to make it. Coming up the exit, we were doing about 80 mph, I told him, “you know you’re not going to make this turn.”

As the car burned rubber trying to stop, the pole kept coming closer. Next thing I remember is the car full of airbag dust. I jumped out and told Don to follow me. After about 40 yards, I looked back to see Don running down the hill leading to the freeway. I watched in fear as he dodged car after car, until he ran up the hill on the other side of the freeway.

From that point, I didn’t see him while I ran for the next hour. Everytime I would stop, I would see another police car. But I made it home, I climbed in the basement window. After I cleaned myself up, I sat down in front of the TV.

My room was in the basement, the one window that worked was my room. After maybe an hour, there was a knock on the window. I jumped up and opened it. To my relief, it was Don. That time it took a lot of running, but we made it.

The last story finds us in the parking lot of a K-Mart. This time, it’s three of us: John, Don and myself. The stolen car we drove there now won’t start. So JOhn is under the hood, Don and I are standing at the driver and passenger doors. Unbeknownst to us, an officer had pulled into the same lot.

We never noticed him as he walked up and asked if we were having car trouble. He was standing in between John and Don. His next question was, “Whose car is this?” John pointed to me and took off running, I understood why. He was already on the run from juvenile detention. But the officer didn’t give chase, he pulled out his pistol and pointed it at Don. He told him, “don’t even think about it,” Seeing this, I knew Don had zero chance of getting away. So I didn’t run, we went to jail together. And John came 30 minutes later.

My decision not to run, shows how I view “running.” It’s more about loyalty, sticking it out no matter the situation. Though I’m serving a LIFE sentence, I can proudly say we are still “running” together still.
