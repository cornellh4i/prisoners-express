**"Smoking Boys" by Red Dot**

Listens to classic rock

Dreams of being in a group

Dreadlocks joints know Bob Marley

The weed was so good

The voice and music great

Would we make it lot of groups

Made up the group the dogs

Red Dot Ken Rob

Ice fogs for some songs Red Dot with

Practice everyday

The dogs had a show coming up

They got a lot of spunk - Poison rosebud won’t be afraid

Tonight the big show

Lot of people in the place

O mouth dropped give that gin

Holy shit it’s Bret Michaels from Poison

We got to rock out for real

Tyson was in the second row, this is got to be good no doubt

Bret showed them some tricks

The fire Bret unleashed had unbelievable

STRICK he was but fun as they enter the set

The Dogs joined the crowd loved them

Claps echoed he heard every word

Poem this all started off, the dogs are a little weird

They got signed by Bret Michaels

They went on tour with Poison

Sony cycle was got to put a lot more

**"Smoking Boys"** **by Red Dot**

In school Red Dot, Rob, and Ken started hanging out. They listened to classic rock, Motley Crue, Guns n Roses, Poison. They took up music class and formed a band. “The Dogs” started drinking, smoking cigarettes, and weed. Red Dot, had to be high to write. He’s a great writer when high. Ken he knows the drums. Rob he barely can sing or he was just so high and drunk he just sounded good. He was practically for a show. When Bret Michaels walked in, sat down, and listened to use them he walked on stage and said,

“Boys, you sound okay but you got to get that fire.” He threw the mic to Rob. “Come on, let it flow. Run around, get your blood flowing.”

They did a song the way Bret said and it was easy or practice and I wait to bring you Dogs to my studio. Stop smoking a little weed is okay, you don’t want to mess your voice up so the groups members practice and got their chance and toured with Poison. This is the start of the group called the Dogs.
