**"Reunited" by Cody Papple**

Heart racing, palms sweaty, clammy. “What time is it?” again I ask myself knowing it’s only been at most 30 seconds. A whole hour to go after five and a half years. “Will they know it’s me? Will they trust me?” I ask myself again. “Of course they will, I’m their father.” But still, there’s that doubt, that panic, that maybe I’m not good enough that fear, they won’t love me. I pray again but still, it has only been a few minutes. “How can this be taking so long? What will my wife think? Have I really changed or am I doomed to repeat this cycle, to be a part of ‘their business.’ What will it be like to be home?” A million questions, ideas, doubts, and insecurities racing through my head, facing freedom. I’m nervous, scared. “How did I come to this?” It’s like stepping from one world into another. I hear something, it’s my name, and it’s really time to go, finally. I say my goodbyes and shake hands, thanking God I finally made it.

Walking towards the outside gates I finally see them. Which will be a memory I’ll never forget. Standing there holding hands, pointing, smiling and waving. My wife holding them back, my daughter six and son eight. “How did I even create such wonder and say.” I can’t resist but to smile and feel overcome with love and gratitude. “Why would I even give them up?” I ask myself all over again, as I try to hold the tears back and make it throughout this last ordeal. My name, my number, date of birth, the Captain asked one last time. I’m now officially a free man he also informed me or something to that effect. I’m frozen unsure of exactly how to take that first step. “Is this another dream?” I find myself terrified, glued in the spot the real-time has now begun, the real challenge being a father. “How do I explain myself?” I see them both now released running towards me from their mother, my beautiful wife. “Why the heck am I still standing in this spot?” As I myself rush forward into the embraces and laughter. I feel joy, my wife shyly smiles at me walking up and I pull her into our group hug. It occurs to me then, I’ve been scared of this, to face the people that love me the most. Why? My own guilt. The forgave me, I have to forgive myself and now move forward with my life.
