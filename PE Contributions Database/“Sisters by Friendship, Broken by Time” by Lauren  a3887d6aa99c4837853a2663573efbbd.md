**“Sisters by Friendship, Broken by Time” by Lauren Shepherd**

I remember sitting in a hotel room in Denver, Colorado with my two best friends, Jenny & Abbey. We talked of how we would be friends forever, even as we were on a grand adventure of our first real road trip. We saw the beautiful mountains outside Colorado Springs, The Molly Brown House, The Focus on the Family headquarters, and it really did seem at the time that we’d be friends for a lifetime.

But fast forward fifteen years and those cords of friendship are broken. Poor choices in her life led to myself and Abbey distancing ourselves from Jenny, and an ill-fated move to Texas and a bad commute situation led to the end of Abbey’s and my friendship. Jenny had a child and married an abusive man, moving to small town Arkansas in pursuit of a love that still evades her. Abbey married a good young man to please her family, though she did not love him, and they’ve had a long and rocky road.

I made many poor choices and came to prison, which is a path neither of them would have ever understood. The irony? I am more free than either of my sisters, having set free some of my demons and the barriers that held me. I pray the same for them and maybe someday they will set free their demons and we can be sisters once more. I know that we have all made our own paths in life and maybe I misjudged them based on what I knew of their history. But I still love them and honestly, I still miss them. I wish life had turned out differently, and yet, I know somehow that we three childhood sisters ended up exactly where we are supposed to be. And that’s okay.
