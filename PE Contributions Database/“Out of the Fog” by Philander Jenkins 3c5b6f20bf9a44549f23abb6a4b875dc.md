**“Out of the Fog” by Philander Jenkins**

As I played tag and rode my bike through the hood, I had no care in the world except getting the prettiest girl in my class to go out with me. To be liked by everyone in my class and my hood. At 10, what did I truly know about life? The innocence of a child is true beauty; either you were my friend or you were not.

In my Chicago hood and my little world, everyone was the same. Even though I was black, I did not truly know what that meant because to me, everyone was just a person.

One day back in Chicago, I sat and watched TV with my grandma- a soap opera to be exact. As we watched TV together, I’ll never know what hit me, but out of nowhere, I began to look back and forth at the lady on TV. The lady on TV had real light skin. So did my grandma. This lady had blonde hair; so did my grandma. Then I began to look at myself and see my skin was not the same as either one of them. Not white nor as black as some of my friends, but light. As I looked at myself, my grandma, and the lady on TV, it hit me. God damn, my grandma was white.

My grandma caught me staring at her and asked, “What are you looking at?”

I asked, “Grandma, you white?”	She replied, “Boy, what the hell you think I was?”

I just looked at her and said, “My Grandma.”

All she did was smile, then replied, “Baby, color does not matter; never get caught up in it. Treat people how you want them to treat you and judge them based only on how they act. Always love who your heart says to love, and you will be okay.”

A few years later, my mom moved us from Chicago to Minnesota, and it was there I was first called the n word and my girlfriend, a “n-” lover. It did not take me long to understand that not everyone thought or felt the same way I did: that people were the same no matter the color of their skin. As I became older, I began to truly understand the different ways that society sees black and white.

My grandma is very old now, and I haven’t seen her in a long while. But what she helped me come to realize on that day way back when I was a kid, when I discovered that I was black and she was white, is that skin color truly doesn’t matter. I am confident in myself and happy with who I am. It was on that day I realized that to hate or dislike a person based on race is a waste of time and a disgrace to myself.
