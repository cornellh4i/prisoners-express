Who the Fuck do you think you are? Who the Fuck do you think you are? To capture me in this moment. This very private moment amidst my sanctuary. This moment of my tortured survival. This moment of...me. Who do you think you are to immortalize me in the Finality of a “still” when nothing is so? Oh how I crave stillness!

But here you are snapping away. Capturing bits and pieces of my Fleeing Soul, as each pixel struggles to understand and portray the enormity of it all. As each shadow dramatized the simplicity of it all. See this “still” through these knowing eyes, and watch the complexity dissolve.

Who in my creator's name do you think you are? Immortalizing me. Immobilizing me. Ensnaring my very essence with such a Finality that only death knows.

Who the Fuck do you think you are? I surely know who you are… Because I know who I am. I am the earth beneath my paws, And the worth beneath my flaws. I am Everything.

And nothing at all. I am ever changing. I am nature’s only enemy. “I AM LIFE!” I bellow from the highest peak. Painstakingly navigating this unforgiving landscape of despair, in desperate need of repair.

“I am weak” I cry silently.

No! “I AM STRONG” I roar defiantly.

I am a sniper camouflaged in the wood.

I am the beauty and the beast.

I am a wisp of smoke. Elusive and ever changing as I drift to my final destination. So look. “LOOK” I scream at you. Invoke my privacy. See my savagery. My misery! I am the hunter and the “haunted”...Haunted by your thick, humid, inescapable judgement.

So capture me. Ensnare me. Enslave me. Enslave me to these pixels, as your perception betrays me. As it betrays we. I am suspended in time, And frozen in this photograph.

I am what this rugged landscape has. Forced me to be...Sound familiar? I AM JUST LIKE YOU. But who the Fuck are you?
