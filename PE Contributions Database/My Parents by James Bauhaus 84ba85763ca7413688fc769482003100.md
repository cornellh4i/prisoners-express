My Parents by James Bauhaus

My mother and father were about 7 years old when the first Worldwide Financial rip-off began in 1929. The stock market crashed, all the rich people took their money, and everyone else’s money, and began hoarding it. The little people, the working class, the suckers who had been tricked into putting their life’s savings into the stock market and other types of financial trickery, suddenly could barely afford to buy food. They certainly could not pay the rent, or their mortgages. The landlords couldn’t let them live there for free. The banks began sending the cops around to throw everyone out. Since none of the actual producers of society could afford to buy anything but food, manufacturers couldn’t sell anything. Since they couldn’t sell anything, they had to lay off their workers. Without a paycheck, workers couldn’t even afford to buy food. The politicians had no idea of what to do to fix the problem that they had cause by taking bribes from corporations to let them write their own laws. So the politicians dithered in their mansions, enjoying their luxury, not really caring that workers were starving.

The church noticed. People who are close to dying of exposure to the elements, and watching their children die, often become very religious. The church was glad to provide food for converts, and to act as their intermediaries to shame the politicians into doing their jobs of serving the public.

When the church and the working class masses were finally able to pry the politicians' lips off of the corporate teat, and shame them into trying to do something useful, the merchants and the rich, parasite class road-blocked every plan. Obviously the only way to get everyone working again was to water the plants at the base of the food web. Money is like sunlight to the producer-class of society, and the rest of society will eventually die off without them, The merchants and the rich could not see this. When president Roosevelt put workers on the gov’t payroll, all they could see was their fortunes shrinking as gov’t printed more money to pay his national construction workers.

For 13 years Roosevelt fought the slacker-rich to give workers his new deal and fair deal programs. He finally lost, when the supreme court, made up of rich slackers themselves ruled against him. Their ruling made zero sense but now it was The Law! The Government could not provide jobs and paychecks for the public, not even when they starved. Not even in America!

My parents survived somehow. Conditions were even worse in Europe, particularly in Germany, where they were still paying reparations to the winners of World War One. Hitler had the same answers as Roosevelt, but he had his workers making weapons too. He won his fight against the parasite classes who lived off the interest from their money, or lived by being price gouging merchants or middlemen. Then he bloated-up his military to steal back what had been taken during the war and more. My parents fought and survived this new world war that put everyone back to work, killing each other. When it was over, the survivors had plenty of money to spend. Trillions of dollars at the bottom of the economic pyramid did what it has always done throughout history: It trickled up to the rich again. Everyone prospered until 1970, which is when the rich began to get too greedy. They raised prices, cut wages, and began again the cycle that leads to another worldwide worker ripoff like the one that was so destructive to the lives of my parents.
