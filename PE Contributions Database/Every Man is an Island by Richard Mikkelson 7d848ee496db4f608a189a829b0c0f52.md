**"Every Man is an Island" by Richard Mikkelson**

It all started out so early in life, I do not even remember the exact point in time. Maybe it was when I asked a question in grade school that everyone thought was silly and laughed at me. Maybe it was when I skinned my knee and people mocked my tears because they thought I was being a crybaby. But, I do know it started before I realized that I was building walls, emotional walls to save my feelings and to avoid embarrassment. One brick at a time, the walls were just beginning to rise.

*I build walls,*

*A fortress deep and mighty,*

*That none can penetrate.*

Later in life the walls kept rising. I was better than the average athlete, but I quit the team when I dropped what would have been the game winning touchdown. My first crush left me, up goes the wall, higher and higher. It did not occur to me then that everyone's first love leaves and life goes on. I only felt the fiery blistering of my little broken heart, a few bricks more I add to my wall.

*Deep within my gloom,*

*I touch no one,*

*And no one touches me.*

I tried mild drugs, smoked a little weed, and drank a little alcohol. I let my hair grow long, got a few too many close calls, and landed myself in jail. In any case, I felt shunned, started hanging out with rougher crowds. Enough bricks now, I am an island, alone in this world.

*I am a rock*

*I am an island.*

The next thing that happened was a more serious crime, which resulted in a more serious sentence. I could only see my walls now, so high that people could not reach in to help me, and I could not reach out. My fortress destroyed me and my island insured that destruction. As pretty as my walls were, as intriguing as my wonderful island had become, it was all in fact, my own undoing.

*And a rock feels no pain,*

*And an island never cries.*

Now, instead of my walls surrounding me for protection, my island is isolating me. I am surrounded by real bars, real brick walls, and real razor wire. Not to keep others out, if only that were true; but, to keep me in, in, in, for so, so, long.

*And a rock feels no pain,*

*And an island never cries.*

Even so, I have learned that people need people, that sometimes growing is not always kind, and that adversity is only a building block for a better future.
