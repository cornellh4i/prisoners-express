**“Tricky Business” by D Gresham**

It’s tricky surviving as a minority. A white transgender woman in the Chain gang. 6 foot and 154 pounds. A lot of tattoos. It’s tricky business trusting people, when there’s only two types of characters you meet. The men who only talk to you because they want to have sex and or take advantage of you or the men who harass you, pick on you, or beat on you because you’re different. It’s tricky business knowing who to trust. The easy thing is to trust no one. For a woman forced to live amongst a bunch of men filled with testosterone and adrenaline, that’s a tricky business. It’s a dangerous life but an unavoidable predicament. To survive as a minority, that’s tricky business. Especially in solidarity.
