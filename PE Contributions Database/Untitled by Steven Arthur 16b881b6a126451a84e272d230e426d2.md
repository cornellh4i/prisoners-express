We were inseparable. At least that’s what the doctors in three different children’s hospital across the nation told us. My sister and I were born by cesarean section on August 13, 1973, literally joined at the hip: conjoined twins.

She was the healthier of the two of us. At six pounds eight ounces, she was nearly twice my weight of just under 5 pounds. It was a real touch and go for me at first, is what Mom had told us. I was cyanotic and lethargic due to poorly developed lungs, but with the care of neonatal specialists I fought through and celebrated my first birthday--or rather we celebrated our first birthdays--at the St. Jude’s pediatric wing.

Despite the rough beginning and that fact that my sister and I shared a liver and some vital blood vessels, the doctors gave us a clean bill of health. Being conjoined was potentially lethal, but our position of facing each other caused more problems and fights than anything else. My mom told me years ago that she used to joke that my sister and I loved each other and hugged so much that we fused together in the womb. After a year and a half, we went home.

The first few years went as expected for two infants. Long nights and short tempers. Dirty diapers, special dietary requirements and more dirty diapers. During a checkup with our pediatrician, routine blood work discovered that our shared liver was being overworked, and the doctors were concerned. They initially thought there would be more time for medical advances and other options to develop before having to broach the subject of surgical separation.

We were both toddlers technically, and with the help of strenuous physical therapy we were semi-mobile, only a year behind what was considered normal of children our age. She did most of the work; I was nearly half her size and she more often carried me like a purse than walk.

The doctors tried everything they could to postpone the inevitable surgery that would separate us. At our underdeveloped age, the risks were outstanding. The plan was to let us get a little older, find a suitable donor for me and do the surgery in marathon style of about twenty two hours.

Just short of our fifth birthday, those plans failed. One morning when neither of us could wake, we were rushed to the hospital. The doctors regrettably had to ask my parents to choose which one of their babies would have the best chance of survival. They would leave a small part of liver in me but with the treatments available, would only give me a twenty percent chance of survival.

Against all odds, the separation was a success--to a point. I vividly remember waking up in pain and feeling empty, and my sister was gone. With only a piece of the liver, I was doing considerably well. The doctors’ only explanation was that I was nearly half the size I normally would be at that age, and so my body didn’t have the usual stress.

My sister didn’t fair so well. She never woke up from the anesthesia. The surgery was successful, but she stayed comatose; her organs began to fail and was put on long term life support. Eventually the decision was made to let her go.

Death from a broken heart? I’m not so poetic to think so. On the other hand, I believe we had kept each other alive somehow by being that close. Sharing the same blood and organ is an intimacy that cannot be replicated or explained. When we were separated, she gave me the gift of life at the cost of her own. I can still feel her here with me.
