**"Simple Pleasures" by Gregory Turner**

Well since I lost most ability to call my own shots on my life, I can no longer look at any type of pleasure simply. The simple pleasure you got from looking at a woman and being able to approach her. Man, that is one of the most painful things to have to and shut off. Your sex drive at 19, please, you will do better telling the sun to set in the east. To be able to get up and shower when you want to. I have been in bondage for 10 " years and the simple things that I abused in my everyday life have come to reveal it to me as what's real in life. Hoe I used to love going outside and looking at trees and smelling the air after it rains. I have not seen a tree. I don't even want to think about food. I have been to juvenile many times and starved, so I know adult prison was not going to be any better. Yet I threw caution to the wind and became a criminal. Just to think about the food should keep people out because being able to choose and cook your own, nothing can beat that. The simple pleasure a man gets from loving the one that birthed me, the only true lady that you will gladly move mountains or die for. My mama is first and true love. The love I took for granted, the simple pleasure I get from just seeing her smile or fighting mad. Now that she is growing old I am not there for her. Any child that's worth their weight in salt is honor-bound to care for mama in her late years or sooner if you can.

I want readers to understand something: If you think about the simple things you take for granted, before you do something to lose them. Think about the way your life would be without them. I see the simple is what prepares us for the bigger and better. Well, this will do for my simple pleasures, so I will close until the next episode.
