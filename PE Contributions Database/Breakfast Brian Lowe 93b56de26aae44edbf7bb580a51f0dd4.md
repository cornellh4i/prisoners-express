**"Breakfast" Brian Lowe**

Most people think of breakfast as bacon and eggs, hash browns, sausage, pancakes, cereal. There are many things available for breakfast, and each person has their own tastes and favorites. I for one, have a couple of distinct favorites.

For instance, if I am running behind, or just in a hurry, I lean towards crisp buttered toast with a thin coating of peanut butter on one side. Easy to make and quick, it is also not very messy with hardly any clean up necessary afterward. It’s a meal on the go. Or if I am feeling cozy, laying around or even just in the mood for it, I make my most favorite breakfast meal. It is also very simple to make but this one is, not very healthy at all. I guess that's part of why it is so good! First, I put a whole jar of peanut butter in a microwave-safe bowl, then microwave it until it is soft and easily starved but not burnt. Then, I add a square or two of baking chocolate; dark, milk chocolate, or even white chocolate, sometimes I may substitute this with other baking flavors such as caramel, or butterscotch, or even add them for the mélange of flavor. After stirring this into the peanut butter, I then dose this with a thick layer of honey. I then stir this conglomeration into a brown, foamy, solid and either eat it as it is with a spoon, or spread it on cookies, honeybuns, granola bars, or whatever I can find on the shelf that hasn't already been devoured by the kiddos. And of course, this is all washed down with cold Dr. Pepper. Now, this is the breakfast of champions.

Somedays I will eat oatmeal, or yogurt, or cottage cheese with a few cookies crumbled up in them for flavor and substance. I reckon this is my closest concession to eating a "healthy" breakfast.

For the days I feel like cereal, here is how I would make my version of it. A pack or so of cookies go into a bowl. Cover with milk. Devour it with a tablespoon. BAM! Homemade cereal!

Just in case you haven't caught on yet, I am not the best role model for healthy dieting. My wife has often got onto me for eating three boxes of cookies, a jar of cake frosting or all of the candy we have in the house for breakfast. She has never seen a choco-holic as bad as I before.

Now I eat an entirely different menu if I am at a my best friend's house. He fixes this fried eggs and pork chops meal with fresh tortillas that is the best I have ever eaten.

Well these are my favorite breakfast meals, although I am open-minded and always looking for other ideas to test as well.
