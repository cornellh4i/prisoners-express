**“The Guardian” by Jevon Jackson**

David was driving home late one night when he quickly came upon a deer, frozen like a terrified wax statue, in the middle of the icy road. David quickly jerked the steering wheel to the right as he swerved, completely missing the deer, then spinning off the road. The black Toyota flipping, roof down, onto the snowy embankment. Without a seatbelt on and the airbag failing to deploy, David left like loose sock tumbling inside a dryer as the car rolled sideways down into the tree line. And then everything went black.

David could feel something dragging him across the snow. His eyelids felt like they both weighed a thousand pounds each, and his lungs, helpless, as if his body had forgotten the involuntary memory of breathing. It felt like David was suffocating. As he slightly opened his eyes, he could see a dark figure, a woman, standing over him, then kneeling with her hand reaching inside his jacket and under his shirt. Her hand felt like a soothing warmth of light as she moved it across his sternum and over his chest. Then a sudden big inhale, as if he had been holding his breath underwater for too long. He opened his eyes completely and he could see her clearly. Behind a black lace veil she had bright amber eyes that shone like caramelized moons. She was wearing a long, flowing black lace dress that appeared to be floating above the white pristine snow. Her wings, shaped like an angel’s, were scarlet red at the edges and darker - maroon, burgundy - as the feathers layered closer between her shoulder blades. And just like that, she was gone without a word. Disappeared into the crisp, chilly December air.

When the police and paramedics arrived at the scene, they were amazed that David hadn’t suffered life-threatening injuries - there was only a tiny scratch on his head -considering that the steering column of the Toyota was pushed like a javelin through the center of the driver’s seat. David knew it was his guardian angel that had saved him. It wasn’t the first time.

About 22 years ago, when he was 15, swimming alone, he remembers struggling underwater in the deep end of his neighbor’s pool. His students had got caught in a suction drain. He remembers losing consciousness and then waking up pool-side coughing up pool water, with the woman with the smooth alabaster skin and amazing amber eyes leaning over him. Beneath the beaming summer sun, she kissed him gently on the forehead with her dark crimson lips, and softly stroked the side of his face. She smelled like warm vanilla and wild lavender. The black lace veil fell down over her eyes and then she was gone as if one blink had sent her away. It was the same guardian angel that had appeared after the car crash. He had been dreaming of her since high school. After years of convincing himself that she was just an apparition, he knew now, without a doubt, that she was real.

Two weeks after the car accident, while at work, David came up with a plan. He had to meet her. To talk to her. To find out who or what she really was. After working overtime, late at night, he went up to the roof of the building. Cautiously, he stepped up onto the ledge. Forty stories high. He knew this was crazy, but it made sense in his mind. His heart was beating double-time in his throat. His stomach was tighten-ing itself into a ball of tiny knots. *Just don’t look down*, he reminded himself. And then he lurched himself off the ledge into the open dark sky below. Before he could descend a few millimeters, from behind him a hand reached out, grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back onto the roof.

“David, what are you doing?” He knew it was her voice - soft, yet stern - before he turned around to look at her.

“I… I had… I just had to meet you,” David stammered as he regained his footing. Through her veil, he could still see her bright amber eyes sparkle in the calm darkness of the night. She eyed him for a moment then spoke calm and forcefully,

“You’re not supposed to be able to see me. For it is not written in the timeline.” Her scarlet red and burgundy wings flexed, extending then contracting.

“I've been dreaming about you for years,” David explained. “Ever since you saved me in that pool.

Just then, thunder rumbled throughout the sky and branches of orange-white lightning crackled above the rolling gray storm clouds.

“The timeline is compromised,” she said, looking frantic towards the sky. “You are no longer safe on this planet, my King. We must return you to Altrozon.” She quickly hugged him around the chest and they both ascended high beyond the zenith of the sky.
