**“Thwarted” - Benjamin Norton #F50708**

I sat here for a moment thinking of the theme “thwarted” and somehow had both a million ideas…and nothing at all. All of these thoughts, feelings, emotions, and memories are flying around in my head, coursing through my soul, just begging to get out. Dying for release. Then I grab my pen and- BOOM! My mind is blank. I don’t know where to begin. I don’t know what to say. How do I explain to the world what I’ve been through? How do I convey how I felt in the past? Can I successfully get on paper what I’m feeling today? How can I express what it feels like to live for over a decade thinking I am going to die in this cold concrete hell? Do the words even exist to describe how much life means to me now?

In an attempt to reign all that in, center myself, and find a foothold, I picked up my dictionary/thesaurus to begin with the most basic definition of thwarted’s meaning. What I found ran much deeper than the mere definition. Under the synonym description it states, in part, “Thwart suggests using cleverness rather than force to bring about the defeat of an enemy or to block progress toward an objective.”

That’s when it hit me and I knew what I was going to write about. You see, I have been participating in a lot of self-help groups these last couple years and they have taught me a lot. One thing I learned is that every single one of us men and women behind bars all have a common enemy. It’s not another gang, race group, inmate, the police, the administration, the courts, lawyers, DA’s, or the government. Our enemy has always been ourselves.

Think about it. No one forced you to snort, smoke, or slam that drug. Nobody made you rob, steal, attack, or kill your victim(s). These are all choices we made that had serious consequences. I do not mean just for us either. Look at what we caused our victims, their families, our families, and then ourselves to suffer through. How did we come to make such life-altering mistakes?

Well, the detailed answer to that is different for all of us. Yet, I am willing to bet that there are a lot of similarities in our stories. But, the basic answer to the question is that we have thwarted ourselves time and time again throughout our lives. We find clever ways to trick ourselves into thinking what we are doing is okay. We justify it, or find ways to excuse our behavior. We may have even become ingenious enough to delude our entire reality into fitting the lifestyle we are living. And every time we get a break, a chance, an amazing opportunity that tricky little “us” is there to thwart us yet again.

I can only speak to my own truth. I started going to juvenile hall at age twelve. I would spend the eight years following that in and out of juvie, camp, and then the county jail and prison. I have only myself to blame. I had family, counselors, PO’s, lawyers, DA’s, judges, and countless others that offered a myriad of ways out of the life I was living. I just blinded myself to each and every one of those hands that were trying to pull me out of the waters I was drowning in. I’m sure if you take a long hard look at your life you’ll see that you had those other roads provided that you could have gone down.

Unfortunately, we did not. Otherwise we would not be sitting in prison now. For me this ultimately led to the 25 to Life sentence I am currently 13 years into serving. Over those years I honed my ability to thwart myself into an art form. I had almost twenty years of practice put into tricking, lying to, and deceiving myself. It may not have been my only talent, but it became my forte.

Then, through persistent and unconditional love from my family, and from learning and growing as an individual I came to see that I was my own worst enemy. It was not a sudden epiphany but one that dawned on me over time. With this realization came the colliding of my two “selves.” The one that doomed me to failure at every possible turn, and the one that wanted more for my life. As I wrestled with who I was and who I wanted to be I began to thwart the thwarting me. It was not an easy decision to change my life. It should have been but that’s the insanity of the life we lead isn’t it? It went against everything I had believed in for so long. It almost killed me, and I mean that literally. That, however, is a story for another day.

What I’ll close this out telling you, my friends, is that seeing our attempts have been thwarted is the first step in our journey to a better life. The second is knowing that we are the ones who have been thwarting ourselves. As we progress we will not let this excuse our past behavior, but neither will we hold it against our future self. It’s not their fault. It’s the past us that put up with this behavior. But we are of a sound mind now to recognize this self-destructive pattern and put an end to it. I tell you from experience that it is possible, and that you are not alone in your struggle. Just keep striving at being the thwarter, and stop being the thwarted.
