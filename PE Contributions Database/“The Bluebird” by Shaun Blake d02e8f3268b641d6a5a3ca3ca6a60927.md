**“The Bluebird” by Shaun Blake**

At a family reunion in the summer of 1995, my wife and I waited for the rest of the family to get up so we could have breakfast. We sat together in the dark silence of the lodge’s main hall talking quietly, watching through the big plate-glass window as the sun peeked over the horizon.

As the hall began to grow lighter, Shawna noticed something under the table next to us. Upon close inspection we realized it was a small bird. Turning on the light so we could see better, we identified it as a young bluebird. It must have flown into the lodge, couldn’t find its way out, and finally collapsed on the floor. It looked dead; its beak partly open, its eyes closed, its feathers ruffled, its body unmoving.

Shawna reached down to pick it up; as her fingers touched it, she felt its breast moving as if with breath or a heartbeat. Startled, she jerked away into my arms. She looked at me with pleading green eyes. Nodding assent, I crouched and gently picked the bird up in my cupped hands. As I stood the bluebird suddenly stirred, flapped its skewed wing into place, and clutched onto my index finger with its tiny talons. Shawna gasped behind me; I froze expecting it to fly away. To our surprise the little bluebird perched on my finger, its breast slowly moving in and out with the breath of life, its eyes closed.

Cupping my free hand around the one with the bluebird I headed out the door - Shawna hovering.

“I’m going to get some sugar-water or something and see if it will feed,” she said heading for the kitchen.

“I’ll be just outside on the porch,” I returned over my shoulder, walking out the door.

As I waited for Shawna I gently brushed my finger over the bluebird’s head and back, closely looking for injury. My eyes roamed over the bluebird’s beautiful, sky-blue plumage and chestnut breast. It sat unflinching and I marvelled at nature’s beauty. I didn’t see anything wrong.

Shawna came with some maple syrup mixed with winter. As I continued stroking our patient’s plumage, Shawna dipped her finger in the liquid and held a drop to the tip of the beak. The drop disappeared. Again she retrieved a drop and held it close to the bluebird’s beak. This time a tiny tongue licked the drop off her finger. With growing relief we took turns feeding drop after drop to our new friend.

Its heartbeat grew faster and it fluttered its wings. I felt its talons clinch my finger tighter and suddenly the little bluebird opened its eyes, spread its wing, and rapidly flew to the porch banister. There the bluebird seemed to take stock in itself. Satisfied, it look around with quick little flits of its head, stopped on us for a moment, and then flew to a nearby tree, landing on a limb. It gave us a sweet, mellow song and disappeared.

We stood holding each other. Shawna was weeping quietly and I could feel a tightening in my throat, my eyelashes damp. Clearing my throat I looked down at my beautiful wife, hugging her close.

“I’ll never forget this experience.” She said, kissing me tenderly.

“Nor I,” I say, returning her kiss. “I’ve never rescued anything before. It’s humbling.”

“Yes, yes it is. It’s a wonderful feeling.”
