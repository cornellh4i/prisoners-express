**"People Running" by Red Dot**

On CNN, Kate Boldwin was speaking about the problems in North Vietnam. Kate was saying there were tribes of people running through villages and killing and raping the women and kids. They showed families running for their lives. I’m on a plane to Vietnam for my new book called “Sky and Death”.

Red Dot was sitting in his first class seat, on his laptop, saying “it’s too late to turn back”. He’s got a girl on his first book tour with whom he’s stayed in contact. She wanted to come to the States with Red Dot, but Red Dot is writing books and selling drugs. Money is the only thing on his mind. Tunia is a very good girl and comes from a small family.

The plane landed and Red Dot got off and walked down the street. It was one of the only paved streets there. It turned onto a dirt road, and he saw huts with burnt, kicked-in doors. He came to Tunia’s family’s house and he saw that the door was kicked in. Red Dot’s heart stopped, and as as he walked through he say that everyone but Tunia was there and dead.

Red Dot said “I got to find her, where could she be?” Red Dot was thinking maybe the beach. He remembered that she said the waves take all of her problems away, so maybe she went there. Red Dot ran as fast as he could. There was pain in his chest and he could barely breath, but he kept on running until he got to the spot.

“Hello?” he said. He heard running. “Tunia, it’s Red Dot”.

Tunia stopped, turned and saw it was Red Dot. She ran to him and hugged him, crying.

“I’m here, Tunia. It’s going to be okay” he said.

“I don’t really remember what happened. All I know is that the door flew open and they were killing everyone. I jumped through the window and ran. Take me with you!” Tunia said.

Red Dot said “Okay, I’m going to take you back to the USA, and you can start over fresh. Come on.”

As they headed to the airport, they saw people running through the bushes and streets. They got to the airport and waited, and boarded the next flight. They started a new life together and got married. A year later they had their first kid and opened their first business. Tunia wrote a best-selling book called “People Running”.

This shows that through tragic events and turmoil there can be strength and love in the end. Look at Tunia and Red Dot.
