**“Inspired In Darkness” by Jonathan Webb**

Finding what I’m looking for a lot of times is difficult. I am inspired by drugs, lust, sins, darkness, the devil, strip clubs, strippers, and alcohol! I’m in prison therefore media content etc. does not make it easy to find. Without much family support and being a 5th termer and suggesting my beliefs to family would close the door all the way! So no such luck asking for such a request!

I’m 38 and I’m just waiting for a change to act out my delayed desires! I know, I know this is twisted right, but I’m me and this is how I do me. I’ve sworn to my greatest friend, the devil, that I’d never break this pact that we have to never change! I only ask him that he make me the worst.

Therefore, I draw my inspiration from the depths of all that is wrong. I’m not unkind and I’m very nice. I don’t hate except most cops and sorry ass renta cops! I don’t want to come back, but I can’t allow the system to break me; getting high and never coming down is my goal!

However, drinking and using is tough on me, for who I am mentally, insanity lurks in the shadows of my mind and I love to live on the edge. I don’t see limits or fear risks and my wildside gets the cuffs slapped on me everytime! I love to read books and I don’t see myself as underprivileged in those regards, and I’m always willing to learn. I know I sound hellbent and that’s me, so I love to have ideas and be inspired and I need a source that is darkness!

Therefore, when I was five, I was sneaking beer and smoking cigarettes and you know kids just normally just puff and blow out the smoke doing it because it’s bad and exciting! By age 8, I was inhaling and smoking on a regular basis! I want to skip talking about all the youth placements I’ve been to and grew up in even though my mom tried to raise me right at first!

When I was 14, I remember waking up with my heart throbbing to try and enter or get a look at a stripper in a strip club in the hometown I was part raised in. Look at me! This is my concept (sin) from as far back as I can remember! And anything in connection to sins describes me! This is what inspires me!
