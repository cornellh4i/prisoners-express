When I worked at the ATF I rolled out of bed at 6:30,just half an hour before my shift started at 7:00 am. I dressed in a frenzy and threw some of my frozen breakfasts into the microwave. I would prepare these frozen breakfasts one week before. One was a breakfast burrito inspired by the one I used to order at McDonalds.

I would scramble about 10 eggs in a skillet, fry up 10 sausages, chop up two green bell peppers and grate some cheese. Then I would lay out 5 tortillas and pack each one full of these contents. Sometimes I would dribble some salsa over each. Then I would carefully wrap the tortillas over the filling, then wrap each burrito with a strip of plastic wrap.

I would throw all 5 wrapped burritos into the freezer on Sunday night. Monday morning when I got up barely in time to get to work I would throw the burrito in the microwave for a minute, wolf it down, then drive like a maniac to my job.

Picture theme: The lonely survivalist

Yoseph had always pictured himself as a lone survivor, from childhood he devoured tales of post-apocalyptic environments and the types of personalities who might live in them.

The personality he pictured was an "FTW" type: FXXX The World. It was, as humanitarian psychoanalysts might describe it, "psychopathic."

If the question was "When the bombs hit and your neighbor begs for admittance to your shelter, should you let him in or shoot him instead?" Yosepf instinctively identified with the latter alternative.

He fantasized about bomb shelters, bunkers, dehydrated food and stockpiled weapons. He pictured the Last Days of plagues, riots, rape, and pillage. The parts of the Bible he read and enjoyed dealt not with a God of Peace and Love, rather with an angry God of Vengeance and Retribution, the God of the Book of Revelations.

He pictured Humanity as being slowly and painfully crushed in the winepress of God's wrath. (Naturally he pictured himself as the Lord Yayweh, and not as a human grape).

As was natural, he grew up to be an introverted, self-absorbed, egotistical individual. He had trouble dealing with hyper social people who expected him to share himself and his wealth.

Specifically, he had problems dealing with women. Sexual frustration was a lifelong concern.

He worked his way through college as a graveyard shift security guard, dealing with as few people as possible. He majored in chemistry because he had read in a pamphlet in high school that chemists usually worked alone in their laboratories.

He got a job straight out of college working as a travelling analytical chemist, consulting for a company that made anti-corrosion additives for refineries and power plants. The work was lucrative and he lived on a company expense account, driving a company car, staying in hotels and motels and eating in restaurants, all on a company card.

In short order, he had saved up enough money to put his survivalist fantasies into action: an underground, concrete bunker on an offshore island. Enough food to last for 10 years. Enough fuel to cook it with. He bought his nitrogen packed, dehydrated food from televangelist Jim Bakker not because he thought it was the best buy (or even the tastiest food) but because he identified with Bakker's paranoid, apocalyptic Christianity.

He chose an island because he reasoned that in the Last Days the mainland would be ravaged by starving desperate mobs of thugs and criminals. He bought a small island about 20 miles off the Texas coast, reasoning that after 10 years, the starving mobs would have died out and civilization would have a chase to reassert itself.
