**The Finish Line by Vicki Hicks**

The beginning and the end, that is how a race begins and ends. The start line is the finish line. You anticipate the exact same line in the beginning and the end.

I was never athletic. As a matter of fact, I was a little clumsy (two left feet). I ran my first 5K (3.7 miles) as a challenge and a requirement in the Biggest Loser class I was in. My first race was horrific; I worked myself into a fit waiting for the “big” race. I clocked a time of 55 minutes and thought I would die from lack of oxygen. After that, I learned how to breathe slowly, to control my heart rate and realized that my legs were numb and didn’t affect my running. Each time I ran, the finish line was closer and closer. My final 5K time was a mere 25 minutes. In about six months, I managed to shave off 30 minutes from my time. I then tackled a 10K (7.4 miles) and came in quicker than my trainer. Next was a triathlon. I mean you haven’t lived until you at least attempt a triathlon, right? The first leg was a ¼ mile swim, not my strongest leg. I came in dead last in the swim, but quickly made up time on the 11 mile bike ride. For those of you who are familiar with Florida and thought it was flat, get on a bike; we really do have hills, monstrous hills when you have just finished a swim. After the 11 mile bike ride, it was onto a 5K to finish the three legs of the race. I finished second in my age division. Truly, running is 80% mental and 20% physical. If you can mentally get through it, you got it. I now consider myself an athlete; I am not clumsy any longer.

Keep your eyes on the finish line; you are a winner!
