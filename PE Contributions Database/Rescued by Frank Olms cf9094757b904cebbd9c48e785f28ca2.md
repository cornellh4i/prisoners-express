**Rescued by Frank Olms**

In the spring of ‘86, I, and four other guys, flew into the Abaco Islands to get a 43 foot ketch and sail it to Newburyport, Massachusetts - a twelve day trip, normally.

April 27th: we raised the sails and headed Northeast. A few days at sea and the weather changed. At 4:00 hours on May 2nd, a screaming wind knocked us over. We were on our starboard side… The boat turned into the wind and righted itself. It whipped like the ‘teacup’ ride at the beach. In seconds the boat was in shambles. By 6:00, we had heave-to and were riding on 30 to 40 foot waves. The sun came up but the sky was black. We rode out the day in solitude and prayer.

The next morning at daylight there was another vessel - a black sloop - drifting nearby, its sails in tatters. The man at the wheel cried for help. He said the batteries in his vessel were all but dead, and wanted a jump start. He said there was a woman on board who was hurt.

This is a common tactic of pirates. They lure you in, steal your boat, scuttle theirs, kill you, and sail away undetected! Marty called the Coast Guard. A C-130 aircraft flew overhead within hours.

We were told to sail into Morehead City. That took the best part of the next day. Come morning, we reached the docks, and tied up was the black sloop with federal decals on the sides of the boat reading “UNITED STATES PROPERTY, No Trespassing.”

If there was an injured woman on board that vessel, she was RESCUED by the United States Coast Guard, and maybe we were too!

We finally entered the waters of Newburyport on June 2nd - thirty-five days after we set sail in the Abaco Islands.
