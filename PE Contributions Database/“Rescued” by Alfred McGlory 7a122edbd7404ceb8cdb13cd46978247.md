**“Rescued” by Alfred McGlory**

We just moved to a new house in Mansura, Louisiana. It was a nice brick home. The last house we lived in was a wooden shack. It was a terrible place to live. Snakes constantly wandered in and out as they pleased. This new place was really nice. I was just a little kid, but I could tell momma and daddy were really proud of our new home. My six sisters all hated snakes, and were so relieved to be done with the creatures. They all shared a bedroom, which left me to sleep in the front room of the house, on the sofa. I mostly slept on the floor. I loved the way that soft carpet felt, and, even though I didn’t have a room of my own, I didn’t care because I had easy access to snacks.. Late at night I would wake up, turn on the TV, sneak into the kitchen. I would open the icebox, and I would eat everything in sight, and drink all of the Kool-Aid.

My aunts and uncles on my daddy's side came all the way from Houston, Texas. I’d love it when they came over to visit. They would always bring gifts, and give the kids 5 dollars, which was a lot of money back then. I would kill it all on pinball, Pac-man, and Galaga. The next day my family planned a trip to the Bay on Chicot. They had invited my sister’s friend, and her family, the Tylers. The daughters' names were Dione, Denise, and LaQuana. LaQuana was a year older than me, and we had a really great time. I sat on the stillway looking at the crystal clear water. My dad, and uncle were on the grill. My mom was on the pier fishing. She loved fishing. So I ran and sat by my momma. She made me a sandwich. She said “Junior, watch my real, and don’t let the fish take it.” I said “Okay”, and was happy to be doing something. I was on the pier with one foot in the water, enjoying my sandwich. Then, all of a sudden, something pulled the reel, and me, into the water. I didn’t know how to swim, and all I remember was green splotches from under the water. My father and uncle dived in after me, and it took them some time to find me. When I regained consciousness everyone was standing around me. I’ll never forget the way LaQuana cried, and prayed that I wouldn’t die. I often think of LaQuana, and my rescue.
