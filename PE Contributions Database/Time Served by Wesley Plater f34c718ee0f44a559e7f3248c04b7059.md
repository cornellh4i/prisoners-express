**“Time Served” by Wesley Plater**

Out of all the things I have been through, all the hurt, pain, depression, anger, I learned to be thankful. Even though I have lost my entire childhood, even though I have been incarcerated my entire life, in and out since twelve years old, and I haven’t had a real birthday with family since I was fifteen, I turn twenty-six in February. I used to be spiteful and filled with hate, but over time I began to think. If it were not for this, I might be dead. If it were not for this, I would still be unable to think of what I need to do to better myself and establish a career. It took a long time to get this enlightenment, but if I was in the streets I would still be scheming and still not able to think past go. And so for that, I am thankful.
