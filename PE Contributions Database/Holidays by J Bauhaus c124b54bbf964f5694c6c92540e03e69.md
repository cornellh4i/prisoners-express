**"Holidays" by J.Bauhaus**

Prison holidays are a little bit different than outside holidays. They are more holiday for the cops than for the captives. All the senior cops get a 3-day weekend. All the beginner cops get to stay and pass out the turkey loaf to the inmates, who remark about how good it is compared to their usual feed. The senior cops go out to a cop-party, financed by the inmates who buy crap and junk food from the prison monopoly store. For every dollar an inmate spends there, at least 30% goes straight into the cops’ pockets. Other markups are much higher. A 13-cent bag of noodles with a packet of flavor-sludge costs us 60 cents. This is what the cops sell most of, and this is a 361% markup. The cops here at this corporate slow-death camp really get their party on when selling the salt of life. They sell it in tiny half-serving packets, like crack cocaine, for a whopping 2800% markup! This is the same as paying $45 a pound for salt!

All the while that these cops are riding their jet skis and stuffing their faces with barbeque, their hated captives are fighting over these soups and trying to mooch-up some salt or cheese to put on it. The kops suck out the inmate money like vampires, keeping their victims so ground-down and penniless that they often sell sodomy to get a break from eating the usual prison garbage.

Just today, the cops passed out pints of ice cream for some reason, making it a holiday for us. Some inmates went door to door, trying to get a guy’s ice cream now for the promise of payment next week. When no one was willing to do this, they brought out stamps. Any little thing can be like a holiday for captives.

Yes, there is nothing that breaks the monotony of being cruelly locked in a toilet-sized cage year after year than some kind of holiday where they shove something different through. The bean hole!
