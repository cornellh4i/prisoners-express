**“Blind Link You” by Robert J. Richter**

An old human woman, blind. Actually, all humans are blind. I mean, except for me! I was misled, spent thirty years working on nonsense, but when I saw the truth, I abandoned the lie. Not you! Oh no, you choose to be blind, one eye clouded with cataracts, the other intentionally covered. I can show you the truth, but you refuse to see it.
