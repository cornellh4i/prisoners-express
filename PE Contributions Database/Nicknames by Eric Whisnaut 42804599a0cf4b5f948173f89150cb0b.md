Names are something given at birth. And sometimes that doesn’t describe who you are as a person. So when someone comes along and brands you a different name it usually describes who you are, or a part of your personality. True nicknames are earned or given. It’s not something you give yourself.

Take my friend Roach for example. He got that name because we were drinking at a Flop house when we were very young and a roach fell in his liquor but he drank it anyway. Thus branding him with the name Roach. All through high school everyone called him that.

In prison everybody has a nickname. No real names here. My homeboy from home is here and we call him Trip. Everyone calls him Trip because he’s been shot in the head and his motor skills are messed up. So when he tries to walk it looks as if he will trip and fall. Plus there are times when he actually does trip and fall. He takes it all in stride and laughs as we laugh with him, not at him.

However, I will never forget my first true nickname. I was around twenty-two years old. And a bunch of friends all lived in a house, my cousin, my best friends, a couple girls, my cousin’s mom, and my uncle. The first sign of a nickname forming for me was when two girls got into a fight in our front yard. While the girls were fighting, I was rooting for the one who stayed with us and it was her first real fight. She doing good so I kept yelling “Hit her some ‘mo’, hit her some ‘mo’”. After the fight all the people in our house were giving me hell about the phrase hit her some “mo”!

The next time it occurred I was branded for life. Our house was branded (The IGLOO) because we were young and doing a lot of coke back then. Coming to hang out at the IGLOO usually ended with you “snowed” in and couldn’t leave. So my best friend was nicknamed ‘Esco’ like Pablo Escobar because he supplied the connect to the blow. But every time we bought large quantities of blow we would always argue over my cut. When he would slide me my part as I always did I said “Hell nah we better than that, put some Mo in my bag!”

So after time and time again of this statement he finally said “You always talking about Mo in this or do Mo that! That’s your new name, from now on, ‘Mo’.” At first I didn’t like it and everybody else laughed and loved it and they called me that name anyway. The girls thought it was cute, the guys thought it was funny, but me? I hated that shit. Me and my best friend were branded Esco and Moe for the Escomos living in the IGLOO. Only then did it make sense to me to have that name. So I decided to find something to make those initials stand for and I did. Only now I added an E to the name and I’ve found dozens of names for it. But the best is: Moe - ‘Move over everybody’.

Because I’ve got to have ‘Mo’.
