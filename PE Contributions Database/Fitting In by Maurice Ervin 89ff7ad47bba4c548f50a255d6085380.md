Wanting to fit in caused my life to be the way it is now. Trying to please others and not realizing that I already fitted in a better circle.

I did not have to use so that people would like me. I was liked before I used. So why did I use? I thought I could gain the so-called "in-crowd approval", but actually the real in-crowd was the way I lived before I fitted in with the in-crowd.

I had respect for the law and others' property. Doing as others had done made me fit in. And now, looking at this, I wonder why I wanted to fit in with people that were destructive to me and my life.

The only place I'd like to fit in now is heaven. So how do I fit in? By living and following God's rules, which is not hard to do and would make our lives less stressful.
