**by Jeremy Brown**

In 2009 I had a job working at Atlanta Bread Company. On my way, I was setting up a party at my house. It was St. Patrick’s Day, and parents and siblings were on vacation. Time to have some fun. I was riding my motorcycle down Bay Drive in St. Petersburg. I was in the right of way when an elderly lady came from the left of me at forty miles per hour. I was flatlined for ten minutes, declared legally dead. I only remember feeling a slight pinch when I was knocked out. My Atman or Astral body was in full consciousness from a metaphysical perspective. I was in my pure energy free form, meaning I was luminescent and able to move with ease. I did not see any other entities. I did not see a light at the end of the tunnel. I was in some sort of limbo. I was moving in the Aether, bioluminescent grayish white clouds. It looked like ectoplasm. Ectoplasm is subtle bodily energy or (Prana - Inner Energy: Skrt). I was not able to move too much. This luminous cloud was holding my free form energy down. It was so exhilarating. No fear, no anger. Just peace. Satori, Samadhi, Nirvana? Who knows.

A few hours later I was awakened in my body. Sterile scents wafted into my nostrils. A tube protruded from my lungs to drain the blood. Stiff, but grateful I was still alive. My family asked me if I was doing okay. I said “I’m alive but my phone is dead”. That got me a few laughs. When everyone left my girl shows up. I tell her the story. I spoke to the nurses and doctor that saved my life. I didn’t tell them my experience though. Strange things were happening ever more frequently after that. I was rescued and awakened to my high self. It’s an amazing journey; this life.
