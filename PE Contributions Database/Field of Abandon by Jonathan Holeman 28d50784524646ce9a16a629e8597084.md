***Field of Abandon* by Jonathan Holeman**

They were moving away, to another place, far away. The dog didn’t know. The man took the dog for a ride in the car.

Rolling along the road to the forest the dog watched out the window and felt excited. He was excited every time he rode in a car, even when he knew they were going to the place where they put him on a table and stabbed him with a long tiny tooth, pushing fluid in his skin. This car ride was to a new place, and far from anywhere he went before. In a car the dog felt as if he were running faster than his legs would go, and whatever was in the car was his pack.

The man who drove the car wasn’t the man the dog loved. The man the dog loved was gone. The female man, or women, she made the good man go away. Then the good man was replaced was a new man. The new man drove the car. The new man yelled at the dog. Sometimes he kicked him. The dog never growled or spit or bit the man because the dog knew his pace in the outside. The dog knew the food came in the time the sun went away for the moon. The dog sat in the car watching the road. The dog knew much, but, not why they went so far in the car.

When the car stopped the man got out and went straight to the door where the dog sat. The man opened the door and yelled, “Get out.” The dog leapt down and started smelling new smells. He sniffed around and noticed a puddle of water. The water was hard, frozen. Fluffy white half frozen water was around the clearing in shaded spots. The dog drifted farther from the car until he heard the car doors close and the man drove backwards away.

The dog was confused. He sat down and waited. He waited a long time until he was thirsty and went to eat snow. He heard a stream of water nearby, but he didn’t know what a stream was. Water came from the sky, or a round green thing attached to the house. He didn’t know the round thing that sent water was green, but it looked different than anything. The dog wondered where the man went. When would he come back? The dog was scared at new sounds and smells.

Much time passed and the sky went dark. It was cold and wet, when clouds moved in. The dog knew about clouds, he knew the smell of water from the sky. There wasn’t shelter for the dog, but he found a funny smelling tree with low hanging breaches. The dog went under the branches and laid down. Cold and hungry, sleep was fitful, and many sounds woke the dog through the night.

Late in the dark the dog dreamt of a time when a tree was in the house. The good man sat with the little puppy by the tree and hung shining things from its branches. They laughed and the dog laid down beside them happy. The dog woke to sounds of birds and sunlight.

He stayed near the place the man drove the car away from. Days past and the dog had found the stream but no food. He was hungry and chewed on leaves and branches. He whined and was filled with sorrow. The man wasn’t coming back. Everything he knew was gone and no one would find him or feed him. He eventually wandered into the forest scarred but not caring. He found a bush filled with sweet fruits and ate.

Long into the night the moon shined down on him as he gasped and cried. The berries were poison. He didn’t know what berries were, or what poison was. All he knew as he lay dying was sorrow. His stomach was a burning pit of flame, his head pounding, his breath fading.

Then, a call came to him. The pain was gone and the sun was warm. The birds chirped and sang. He sat up and running to him were the good man and the man’s puppy. They hugged him and pet him and danced. They gave him fresh food, and odder than it all was that wasn;t in the forest at all. He was home and he went inside with the good man and the puppy. The woman was there and everyone was happy. The tree was inside and there were shining eggs hidden all around the house.

Somewhere far away a pack of coyotes found a large hunk of fresh meat. It smelled like them in some ways, but they didn’t hesitate to eat. The men had built big wooden boxes all over the forest, and the coyotes lost hunting ground, they had to eat whatever they could find, and that day in the field on Abandon was a day when a coyote’s stomach would be filled. It was a good day.
