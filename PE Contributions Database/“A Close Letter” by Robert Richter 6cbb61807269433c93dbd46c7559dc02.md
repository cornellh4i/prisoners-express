**“A Close Letter” by Robert Richter**

Years ago, after much pleading, Gary gave some of my work to a Professor Swalloway at Cornell. I had asked for a student contact, not a professor. Swalloway did a lot of professing but no listening. He went to MIT, after all! His letter was sent to me as “third party mail”, in an envelope from PE, which violates prison rules, but somehow I got it anyway. He asked me a number of questions, but did not include his address. That was the end of that.

So, after years of trying, I finally got a single response from a “professional,” but he skipped right over the key point, then didn’t give me any way to answer his questions. I was one letter away from success, but had no way to get it to him. This is worse than complete failure. It’s a passive-aggressive bitch slap. Swalloway ignored an error in the data. Once you do that, you aren’t doing science.

Time and time again, the staff at PE have had chances to make history, but, like most modern Americans, they have no understanding of even basic physics. Physics is the science of how the Universe works. Unless you have some other Universe to live In, you’d better learn physics! History shows us that the worst failures, disasters, and catastrophes usually could have been avoided, but for deliberate ignorance. Every close call, success or failure, was almost the opposite.
