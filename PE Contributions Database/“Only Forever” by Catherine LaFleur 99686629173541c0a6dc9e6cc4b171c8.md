**“Only Forever” by Catherine LaFleur**	

I am looking at the screen trying to pick out any shapes on the fully gray screen. The image pans out into a triangle. In the middle is the bean shape of my uterus, mysterious and secret. A luminescent being floats inside curled up patterned all over glowing computerized dots.

Instantly, I’m terrified. This is the tiny being I’m sustaining with my life. I can see a fine string of pearls, my baby’s vertebrae strung like a constellation in the night sky. A ball of head like a peony on a delicate stalk, this is my mind’s earliest picture of my child. My firstborn.

Terror adequately explains my fears about being a mother. Growing up in the commune I had held babies, fed babies, changed innumerable babies’ diapers, and rocked babies to sleep. So I was not a stranger to babies. Just that I’d never been totally responsible for one. I’d always been able to give them back and tra-la-la along my merry way. This baby would be mine. I’d be responsible for his emotions, his needs, and most importantly giving him a normal life.

Once the labor and delivery were over (fifteen hours, 12 lbs 6 oz.), I plunged into all things Nathan. Breastfeeding, changing, reading aloud. I had one of those snuggly carriers and wore Nathan like a garment for an additional 6 months of my maternity leave. At the end of that time, I had to give Nathan over to my au pair, Stina. Really, the child was never left alone or put down for the first year of his life. That is another worry. Has that scarred him for life? Have I made this child dependent? Needy Anxious? Unable to soothe himself?

Nathan had a problem sleeping. For no apparent reason, this child would wake up at 1 AM, 2 AM, 3 AM, and grizzle. Nothing would keep this child from crying. The doctor said he had nothing medically wrong with him. Nathan just liked to vocalize. I tried everything: nighttime car rides, rocking him, feeding him on demand, you name it. I felt like a terrible mother already, I was failing him. One night in frustration, I put Nathan belly down on top of my piano and started playing music.

Ah, the expression on his face! I guess the vibration of the notes tickled him or soothed him. His eyes got big and his little rosebud mouth formed a perfect O. My baby started rocking back and forth and then laid his little head right against the wooden lid. Perfection, I thought. Every night Nathan was up, I would lay him on the piano and play *Only Forever* by Bing Crosby, a tune my own father used to sing me to sleep. Would I still love you as the years come and go? Only forever, if you’d care to know.
