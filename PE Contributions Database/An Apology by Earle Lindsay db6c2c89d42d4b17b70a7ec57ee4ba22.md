**“An Apology” by Earle Lindsay**

One thing I have learned in prison is that you will not receive an apology from any officer for having accused you of something you didn’t do.

It’s frustrating to be condemned for the actions of others as well. For example, one time, during a room search, the officers found multiple knives and other contraband in the room I stayed in.

Now, my roommate was the one who kept them hidden from other inmates and I had no clue about it. So, when the room was searched and these items were found, my roommate and I were asked who the said items belonged to.

At the time, I was still new to the Department of Corrections (DOC) and had only been incarcerated in prison for about two months at the time and was considered “green”. So, when asked this question, my immediate response was to deny having anything to do with what they had found.

Of course, my roommate did the same thing and in the DOC, if neither of you lay claim to any contraband found, you both get charged and I don’t feel that that is right or just.

Afterwards, you and your roommate are both given charge papers and got to a disciplinary hearing, where the Disciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO) reads the charges brought against you and where you get to plead your case for your innocence. This however, doesn’t matter.

Afterwards, you are formally charged and you lose certain privileges, such as the use of the phone, loss of visitations, and canteen restrictions. Losing canteen is not so bad. Losing visitation is pretty hard. No phone calls at all… Now that is just plain ridiculous!

They don’t realize how these things affect you mentally. Seeing or talking to your family gets you through the hard times in here and losing your privileges for four months because of something you didn’t do is mentally taxing.

I honestly wish that I could get an apology for the heartache and mental anguish I’ve gone through, that will never happen.

I wish I could get an apology for being labeled as a trouble maker because of someone else’s actions. It is infuriating at times.

The system will never make things right, but I must admit that they have taught me the value of what an apology means to someone.
