**“Because I said Thank you” by Clarence Whitaker-Jones**

At approximately six years old, sometime around 9/11, I was taken from my blood parents in South Philly to live in a foster home in Chester, Pennsylvania. I soon adapted to this new home and was taught manners by my foster mother. My foster mother’s name was Arlene Whitaker but I was told to call her Aunt Doobie. She taught me to open doors for ladies and I would practice on her as we left the KOP mall or entered the Hyundai Civic car. She would tell me, ”Horses eat with their mouth open, keep yours closed!” I eagerly helped Aunt Doobie whether she needed me or not. The most important mannerism she taught me was to say thank you. Aunt Doobie indelibly ingrained in me to show gratitude for everything. I would say thank you so often at everything she did, like taking my foster brothers Derrick, Kyle, and Shamus and me out to eat at Applebee’s or Chili’s. I was the first to say thank you, though my other foster siblings would say thank you too. Aunt Doobie noticed this, and told me “Baby you say thank you so much and I love you for that so here’s extra allowance money and I will take you out to eat this weekend.”

My Aunt Doobie died on Christmas day in 2005. Before she died she told me, “one day you will have to take care of me the way I’m taking care of you.” Well, I do have a goal of putting a tombstone on her gravesite, because there wasn’t one due to a lack of funds. Though I didn’t get a chance to see her reach old age and couldn’t return the caring and gratitude, I can still show my love. She adopted me before she passed away, which showed her love because it costs a lot of money and I was not her biological son.

I owe her a success story. Not just one typed up but actual actions to aid others and make them aware of the word “gratitude” when someone goes out of their way to help. The power of gratitude not only changes lives but it saves lives as well. I’m thankful for opportunities especially when people are dedicated to help me. Because of one lady who helped me grow mentally I am forever re-wired to show gratitude to others. I thank the PE (Gary and volunteers), my Diggins family (Hameen and Hannah), my adopted family (Chanel, Anya, Angie, and Jackie), and my friends (Daine, Cheese, Dennis, Dough, Rashawn, Deb squad, Ralph, HAK, and Pauley). Thank you for giving me a chance to say thank you.
