**“Hope Springs Eternal” by Nate A. Lindell**

“Was it always this way?” Erick asked, staring at the cindered wasteland that was a valley before them.

“No,” Mark responded, looking his boy in the eyes. “Once, it was so green that it flowed. The slopes were covered in grass, a--uh--a plant that was, uh, sorta like the hair on my face, only on those slopes and green. Then there were pine trees, taller than ten of me, with hundreds of branches sticking out from each of them, like smaller pine trees, darker than the grass. If you looked long and close enough, you’d see a grizzly bear and maybe cubs, baby bears. Or you’d see an eld, a world, or hawks circling in the air and looking for rabbits--all sorts of animals.”

It was difficult for Mark to explain what the valley once looked like, what a tree or grass or an animal was, or were. Erick had never seen any of those things, and they no longer existed. The question-and-answer was a daily ritual, asked and answered as they trudged up ridge number WAE839 and awaited delivery of their daily rations. In Erick’s head were fantastic images of the world Mark described which was far different than what the world looked like in real life.

This ritual took their minds off their bleak existence. Like clockwork, at 7:30 New Time, according to the bracelets (watches, tracking beacons, bio-rhythm monitors, etc.) placed on them by the New Ones, the azure drone appeared, scanned them, and then dropped a small package that contained the tubes of bland paste and cartons of water that kept Erick and Mark… existing. After the delivery, the drone silently vanished.

Sometimes the drone delivered medicine if they were sick. The drone was also capable of instantly killing them, as they had witnessed when the drone silently killed their wolf-collie mix dog, Tooth. When a man, who removed his bracelet and fled his assigned quadrant, shot at the drone with a rifle, the drone silently killed that man, too, with what must have been an invisible “death” ray. Several minutes after each execution, another, larger rone appeared and removed the corpses.

Everything changed in the summer of 2021 when a meteorite crashed into the mid-Pacific. An unremarkable tidal wave and damage to the ocean’s ecology resulted, but life on land and human society was otherwise intact, or so it seemed.

A month after the meteorite’s impact, all of the world’s electrical infrastructure simultaneously collapsed. The last T.V. broadcast Mark and his wife Anne heard on T.V. was that the world’s electrical systems were under attack by… then the signal cut off. Mark and Anne watched as their own electronics became covered by sparkling, moving dust that swelled as it consumed the metallic, electrical parts in their phones, radios, T.V., and even calculators, watchers, and Anne’s pacemaker.

Mark watched Anne die.

Hours later, what he dubbed a reaper drone came and collected Anne’s body, while baby Erick blissfully slept.

Whenever Mark recalled that day, an overwhelming, difficult to explain wave of emotion washed through him, leaving him empty, as if he had a soul that was freshly ripped out.

It’d been 8 years since the day Anne died, and the New Ones--what the drones called their masters--had steadily stripped Earth of its flora and fauna. Even topsoil had been scraped up. Where it all went, Mark didn’t know and couldn’t see from his designated quadrant. What was left was burned black by what looked like a broad, concentrated beam of sunlight that came out of the sky.

The New Ones were intent on wiping all life from Earth, and there was nothing that Mark could do about it. As far as he knew, no one could do anything about it. In the back of his mind, Mark knew that Erick and he would be carried off by a reaper drone. It was the “when” that Mark didn’t know. Until then, the tiny, diminishing hope that somehow the planet would be saved kept him going through the motions.

Is this how the American Indians helt? Mark wondered as he thought of European conquest of the Americas.

On the way back to what was left of their house, Erick asked another question. “Will it ever be that way again?”

“Sure. Sure,” Mark robotically answered, and then described fantastic images of what the world’s salvation would look like, far different than what the Earth would look like in real…life?
