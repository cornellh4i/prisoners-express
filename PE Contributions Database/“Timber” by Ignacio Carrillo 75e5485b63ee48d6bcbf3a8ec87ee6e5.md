**“Timber” by Ignacio Carrillo**

I promised my daughter Katie a puppy for her fifth birthday.

TImber, short for Timberwolf, was half German Shepherd, half wolf. She was the runt of the litter, tiny in comparison to her siblings, but with the prettiest grey coat and blue/grey eyes.

She hid from us; we had to drag her from under a workbench in the breeder’s basement.

“You can have that one for half off,” he sputtered from behind missing teeth and a mouthful of tobacco. “She’s the runt, I didn’t think she was going to make it. I won’t guarantee her health.” As I looked at Katie trying to hold on to the squirming ball of fur, I knew it was over before she said a word.

“This one Daddy,” she said, and she walked off, pup in hand.

Timber grew up to be a beautiful, if not miniscule, dog. People often wondered if she wasn’t still a pup. Katie was a diligent owner, walking her twice daily and changing her water as needed. They were inseparable the summer we got new neighbors with their own dogs.

These were the meaninst, nastiest, pair of pit bulls you’d ever seen. They looked like they’d spent a lifetime lifting weights in a prison gym-not an ounce of fat on them, always mean-mugging and tearing at their chain to get loose. Timber was weary of them too, always positioning herself between them and Katie on their daily walks.

Katie tore into the house, clearly terrified and out of breath. “They got loose, daddy” was all I could understand between sobs. I grabbed my baseball bat and ran out, fearing the worst.

I could hear Timber barking. My heart raced, she’s still alive! *I can still save her*, I thought. I saw the blood on the sidewalk before I saw the injured animal. It had a gash across its head from ear to neck and was whimpering loudly. Timber had cornered the other dog back into its own dog house and was clearly transformed. I barely recognized this beast. She looked twice as big-ferocious as any wild animal, with a low rumbling growl that dared the dog to move. As I approached she looked back at me and I swear to God she winked as if to say: runt indeed.
