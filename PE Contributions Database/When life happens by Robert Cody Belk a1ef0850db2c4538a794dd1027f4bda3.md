The extremely unfortunate circumstances that led to my life completely derailing and landing me here was, at first, seen through my eyes as the ultimate reasons to give up. Both my mental and physical health has deteriorated and I no longer saw only relevant reasons to draw another breath. However, at some point (that I unfortunately am unable to specify) am of that changed. Out of sheer perpetual loneliness, I turned back to an old friend. One that had assisted me in the joyous killing of countless hours in high school, songwriting. Once I got back into a lyrical flow, my locker was instantly dated with notebooks and loose sheets of paper and the time was becoming a thing for which I gone less and less of my attention. I made a conscious decision to apply a dedicated and concerted effort into using my modest talents to translate the “shit like” I had experience thus and sublimate the negativity into “the shit.”

I have been through some very hard circumstances even since then, multiple surgeries and a subsequent lawsuit, the details of which I shall not bored you with as not to lose any relevant relatability. But the more horrendous or idiopathic the current situation was, the more more steadfast I was in putting in a verse, knowing that one day my version of truth will make a large impact on the lives of others. The more I write, the more I learn, about my soul and my capabilities. The man who once seemed unconscionable was simply dying inside. A shon of iniquity, one that was lacquered upon him through years of trauma and loss. I simply chose to do and to be so much more.

Approbation is not the desired take away and I dare not to ever come across with hubris. I simply want to be a lighthouse for the downtrodden. When life throws you down and heaps shovel after shovel of “shit” upon you, you truly hold the power to “make shit happen.” Use your story, learn, grow, and find a way to help others through your own heartache and pain. Become that which you never expect to become, don’t remain a shitty person, allow yourself to burgeon into “the shit.” If I can do it, I truly feel that in no certain terms, anybody, ANYBODY, can do it.

One Love,

Robert “Cody” Belk
