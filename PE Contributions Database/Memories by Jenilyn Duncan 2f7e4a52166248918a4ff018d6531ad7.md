**Memories by Jenilyn Duncan**

I feel squeezed into these large pants, I turn and toss all night on my two inch mattress. It is difficult to get comfortable on a slim mattress like that but it is possible when lying flat on your back.

I pop my spine into place like a chiropractor and stretch out all my muscles. I feel resilient.

When exercising- you’ve heard of muscle memory- well mine’s more like fat forgetfulness! Every year after thirty it seems it's harder to keep off the weight! That’s why people lift weights! Our brain is connected with muscle memory by our nervous system. I have a nervous laugh all the time! Sometimes people think we laugh at them but we’re not.

These are memories of being incarcerated and through all of it I maintain my cool by not complaining or reissuing new sized pants because of the fabulous food which makes us gain weight. I already said something funny about that. We hold in feelings that need to find a way of being expressed. Sometimes it’s words, drawings, letters, and crying. Yes- it’s okay. It is cleansing and healing. Sometimes we feel inadequate but we can be resilient with our words and choices and feelings. I can do anything!
