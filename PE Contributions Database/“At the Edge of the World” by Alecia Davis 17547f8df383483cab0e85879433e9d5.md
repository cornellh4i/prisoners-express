**“At the Edge of the World” by Alecia Davis**

So here I am. I feel like I’m at the edge of the world with my feet hanging off with nowhere to go. How did I get here? At which fork in the road did I choose wrong? Now I wonder, how many times did I take the wrong road? A road where I end up with no one here but me. Alone, alone on this road, alone at the edge of the world. Someone might yell “Hey! Turn around! Go back!” But once you’re here, there is no going back. No matter how hard you try, for you can’t live life in rewind.

I can do nothing at all and live right here at the edge of the world. Stuck lost in time, stuck alone in a prison of my mind full of regret. With no hope. And just give up. Allowing the past to repeat itself day in and day out. Or I can choose to see the day where the fog goes away and clear skies remind me not all is lost. And with the sunshine on my skin I may just want to take a swim.

Yes, I can choose to look forward to better days. To break free from the prison within myself. I can choose to swim. And swim I will. I will swim as far as I can and when I can’t swim any longer I will float as far as I have to but sinking is not an option. I will keep swimming and floating until I hit solid ground, and when I arrive I may have to crawl to shore. With two shaking legs I will take the slow and careful steps, but with each step I will grow stronger. So strong that I will never look like I had to swim, float, and crawl from the edge of the world.

I will always remember my journey from the edge of the world, but I will never look back nor will I ever wonder what might have been.
