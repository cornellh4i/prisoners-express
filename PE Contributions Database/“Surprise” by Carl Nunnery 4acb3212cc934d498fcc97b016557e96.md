**“Surprise” by Carl Nunnery**

A little girl is enjoying the sunny outdoors; she has a bucket of cool water ready to surprise someone with a cold splash of water. She was not aware that when she was doing what she thought would be doing the hunting, she was unknowingly being hunted down! She was soon welcomed with two bursts of unsuspecting water sprays which caused her to “shriek”. She laughs in her excitement, causing her to spill the water out of her bucket!

“Surprise!”, they yell in their successful attack on her. If we stop to think about it, this is truly a life experience like we may go through. While we may think we are ready and prepared, we find out how quickly things can happen in our lives that proves we are anything but prepared!

Many, like this little girl, enjoy life in joy and happiness when they suddenly receive a surprise of their own. They realize they are being hunted by a lion (Satan) who is on the prowl (1 Peter 5:8), who is causing difficult times in their life. They realize the only defense against this attack is “Jesus Christ” (Psalms 89:18).

This causes them to look at their lives, to seek Him who protects, to seek him that gives life! This is true of a lot of people who think they are ready for anything when they are suddenly “jolted” by a real surprise of their own!

In the Bible, this surprise is called an “awakening”, it’s when they come out of their spiritual sleep! In (Eph 5:14) it says, “awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light”. You see, when we sin, we are spiritually dead, which means we are separated from God.

Jesus is ready to wake you up by using some unpleasant events in your life that will cause you to re-think just how ready or prepared you think you are!

Wake up to the light of Jesus, and be ready for the surprise of your life!
