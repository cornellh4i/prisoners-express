**"Family Reunion" by Red Dot**

Money clip got killed January 1st, and the word on the street is that Mi8ke in the F550 is the one that did it. I’m cool with him; he’s going to be at a family reunion tomorrow. The day of revenge is here. My boy Red Dot is on his way. As they were talking, Red Dot pulled up in the driveway on his motorcycle with a duffle bag on his back. Demon met Red Dot at the door, “What’s up, bro?” Demon gave Red dot a hug.

Red Dot got Atlanta Braves jersey with a red durag and black Timberland field boots. “What’s up, Demon?” As they sat on the couch, Demon started telling the plan. Remember money clip? Yeah, he got killed a few months ago, right? Yeah, the kid that did it is mike who drives the E550 Benz, the white one. Yeah, I know. I stay close to him, buying weight from him. He’s having a family reunion tomorrow.

“Where,” Red Dot said.

“33 Great School Grounds. So who is it me and you, Red Dot? Check it, I’m calling Cain. I work good with him.” As he opened his duffle bag, he pulled out his phone and called Cain to meet me at Demon’s Star Wars. Cain knew to come ready. Cain grabbed a pistol and the AK 47 with 2 clips, jumped in his whip, drove across town, pulled in the driveway, grabbed the AK 47, walked to the front door, knocked. In the meantime, Red Dot unloaded both of his Mac 90’s, cleaned everything, Demon looked out the window. This crazy-ass Cain is standing at my front door with an AK that’s my boy Demon opened the door. Where’s Red Dot?	Over here.

What’s good, bro?

The Cat killed Money Clip is going to be at a family reunion tomorrow. Kid Mike in E 550 I90T 200 rounds. Money Clip was my boy. Kids everyone will feel the K. Cain, me and you will clear this out. You come from the front, I’ll come from the back way. I know, get them fumming with their backs to us. Demon, you drive. Got you, stay here until tomorrow. I got a stolen whip around the corner. Cain, let that shit spit. I’m going to come through the back fence firing. Don’t fire until I let off 90T. You got something to drink? Red Dot came back with a glass of Lemonade. Check this mask out. What the hell is it? Really don’t know. The night came and went. The sun was rising. Cain ran to Charly Brown’s, got 3 Breakfast pancakes, bacon, hash browns. This food is really good, Demon said about half-hour. I want to be in peace. I’m going to try to slide under a porch and wait until you circle. It’s time I’m going to walk. You drive, Demon. Be on point. Got you. Red Dot found a portcu, slid under it with his Bay. People started to fill the schoolyard. A half-hour later I think Mike will come from across the field. OK, through the back fence. The front. No. Then I saw the E 550. It just went by then I laid and saw it. Right then, I saw Mike and a Spanish girl through the back gate. Cain, hope you is on point. Red Dot eased out from under the porch, through the duffle bag under the porch with 2 Mac’s in hands, mask on, gloves on. Red Dot is seeing the Seans playing out. Before it happened, Red Dot sped up then he started spraying across the Macs. Cut Mike and the girl down, running, firing, popped the clip, turned it over. Cain started tearing everything up. Shit got to get a K. Everyone is falling, spraying. Bodies falling, everything is laying down. Red Dot grabbed the last two clips, ran over to Mike, sprayed his whole body, ran, grabbed a piece of chicken off the grill. Cain and Red Dot ran through the backgate. Demon was right here. Let’s go, take me across town. Don’t speed, Cain said. That was a real family reunion. THey all were visiting their past loved ones. That was for Money Clip. This was a nice job. Call me again, Demon. Red Dot took off one of his shirts, wrapped his guns in it, and walked off. Cain was taken to his house. Demon drove off. Can’t believe it. Nice day for a family reunion -- ha.
