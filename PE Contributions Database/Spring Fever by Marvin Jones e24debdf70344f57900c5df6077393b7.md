**Spring Fever by Marvin Jones**

Can bring out the best or the worst in people. I was used to everyone being happy and friendly when spring time came around (in BOSTON), it meant buying new clothes, or counting down the days till the month of June when school would let out!

After months of snow and freezing temperatures, we couldn’t wait for spring to come.

But now since I’ve been here in Jacksonville, Florida, spring brings a higher death toll… the city is already overwhelmed with violence year round, but for some reason it gets worse with the spring weather. Instead of bracing themselves for the good times associated with spring, Jacksonville dreads this time of year, they pray that the next victim isn’t them or their loved ones.

I long for the days of a Boston spring, when Joy was the norm for spring time!

Hope spring brings you joy and not dread!
