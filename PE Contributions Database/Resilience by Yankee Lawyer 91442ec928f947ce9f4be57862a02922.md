**Resilience by Yankee Lawyer**

In 1919, the life expectancy of an American man was 47 years. The leading cause of death was upper respiratory infections such as pneumonia and influenza.

In the winter of 2016, I was stricken with an upper respiratory infection. I felt feverish. I was tired and short of breath. I experienced chills, shaking with chills, muscleaches, headaches, and violent coughing. Food looked disgusting and tasted like ammonia. I lost 40 pounds but was unable to get medical care.

A couple of new viruses are going around now. Even free people, with balanced diets, fresh air and exercise are not immune. The governments of most “developed” countries have enacted strict measures of containment and mitigation. They were very expensive, so now, although a quarter million people have died and more die daily, things are going back toward the old normal.

The key word now is “resilience”. Will the world full, recover, or will we settle for a “new normal”?

My first wife had cancer. I was a “free” man, then, with a successful and growing law firm. So the received excellent medical care in Boston, Massachusetts. After several months of chemotherapy and radiation, the cancer was in remission. She was soon growing hair and generally healthy, physically. Mentally, though, she lacked resilience. She lost interest in her church, her friends, and her marriage.

For a while after Cathy left me, I was devastated. In time, I recovered.

Will America?

My second wife abused and exploited my children. I tried to stop her. She had friends in high places, so now I’m a political prisoner. People ask me how I stay strong and even appear cheerful.

It isn’t always easy.

The key to resilience is faith. My faith enabled me to stand strong for Cathy and to stand strong against Pamela. It sustains me now.

America has turned its back on God. I fear for its future.
