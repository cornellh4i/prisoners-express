The city. Where millions of egos clash, and collide in a frothy soup of chaos and anxiety. Thousands of interactions take place every minute. Fears realized. Dreams that are made, and those that are crushed. There is so much that is going on. So much activity that it is nearly unquantifiable.

Each individual personality here believes that the universe revolves around them alone. That they are the sole reason for the existence of life. Each, so full of vanity, and shallow desires, that they fail to be able to comprehend the grand scheme.

Yet, for all their shallowness, and self-indulgences, the people in the city manage to accomplish great things. Building skyscrapers, and incredible totems, and monuments to their achievements. Massive structures of such complex design that it boggles the mind. The sheer scale of which astounds.

This not only applies to the concrete, and steel structures of the city, but to the infrastructure of its management as well. How, in such a relatively short period of time, we have come from a species that once roamed the plains of the world as people of small nomadic tribes, to creating these massive metropolitan societies is absolutely amazing.

Even though there is still a great deal of life in the rural areas of the world, and for all of its problems, as well as each individual’s misgivings, the big city remains mankind’s greatest achievement. The triumph over tribal feudalism, and the ability to come together, and build something lasting is a great accomplishment. The city is our greatest realization.
