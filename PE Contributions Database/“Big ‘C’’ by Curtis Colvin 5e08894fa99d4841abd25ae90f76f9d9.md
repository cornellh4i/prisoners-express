**“Big ‘C’’ by Curtis Colvin**

****Back in 1979, while going to high school in Bridge City, Texas, someone started calling me by my initials, C.C. For the life of me, I can’t remember who, but it caught on. While I was in the navy, only a few friends in the services called me that. After two years, I came home to my nickname in full blast. I got married, and my wife jumped on the bandwagon. For the next 8 years, I dealt and used drugs. My addiction grew, and so did my nickname. If you need some [insert drug name here], go see C.C.

I hit a bottom, got clean and sober, and decided to get rid of my drug name by going with my first name, Curtis, for the next 5 years until I came to prison. For the first year, I tried C.C., but everyone kept asking me if I was from Corpus Christi. Also, a lot of guys used C.C. themselves, and so I changed it to “Big C.” That’s my nickname and has been for the past 19 years.
