**“Lost Eyelashes” by Derek LeCompte**

When was the concept of time created? Who came up with hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, and so forth? I wonder what we did prior to that. Sure, day is an easy concept with the rise and set of the sun and moon. Even their positions in the sky are easy concepts to grasp.

I, however, have decided to strip myself of time and physical age for a new concept. It is inspired by two other concepts. The first is the phrase, “blink of an eye,” which we recognize as a concept of speed. The second is an old school concept of telling how much is left on your prison sentence.This was when Soul Train was still in syndication. Men used to express, “Yo! I got ten Soultrains and a wakeup!”

You see, this opened my eyes that time truly is related. It’s all in how we see it. Theoretically, we can speed it up or slow it down depending on how we see it. Soul trains were weeks. So, the person expressing it is choosing to forget the gauges of days, hours and minutes.

For me, when I think of the eye we always seem to relate it to speed. The blink, the quick glance, and the darting stare are all quick actions. When guys find out that I’ll have nearly two decades in prison soon, knowing I’m only 38 years old, they ask me how it feels. So, I choose to express how it feels with a metaphor nearly nobody thinks of. I reply, “It is like losing an eyelash.” It takes a moment to register, then they understand that almost nobody realizes when they lose an eyelash. I further emphasize, “That’s the point!”

I don’t like to look back at yesterday. I enjoy looking at tomorrow. So, my past days got lost like eyelashes. I laugh because people pay attention to just about every hair on their bodies, but only a small percentage of them ever look at the loss of eyelashes. Nobody counts them! But when I realize one has fallen, even if it ends up on my fingertip when I wash the sleep out of my eyes every morning, I smile and let it wash away like nothing. They grow back, just like possibilities of our futures. But when we lose them, we don’t even notice. To me, that gives me a good way to look at the future.

In essence, because 20 years went by quickly, I do consider it like passing in a “blink of an eye,” or to my estimation, 92 eyelashes. Yep, it doesn’t feel like yesterday, it feels like tomorrow.
