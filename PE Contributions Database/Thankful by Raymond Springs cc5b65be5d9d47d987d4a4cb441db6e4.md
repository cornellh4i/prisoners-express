**Thankful By Raymond Springs**

I am! I am! Thankful I am…

The son of a black mother, this makes me the original son. First born son of this Beautiful Earth, the seed planted in the triple darkness of her yoni verse. Thankful I am genetically the god of all creatures as my father is god of all paradise and the inventor of Hell.

I am! I am! Thankful I am…

June’s gift to reality, placed her to borne the paines of this multiplicity of oneness. My own undivided indivisible duality, two beings traveling in the same vehicle a spacesuit. Lover and protector of my sisters, who are moons magnetically lords of the tides in the vast oceans of emotions, pleasure goddesses of sensations, muse of music and imagination. Heaven's Gates are a yonic doors of her inner space where the salty primordial waters flow and I can travel there on the ancient boat of a thousand years with Tehuti as my guide and Anulis as my guardian in the turmoil of that yoni-verse-all sea violently pressing into the whale of all existence until in all existence until in pleasures explosions she screams my most sacred of names… “Ausar Amen.” My sister transforms into the mother over the next 40 weeks which is 9 moons without her usual newness, she births me again separated from her afterbirth and my own new birth resurrection. Thankful I am. Generations yet still one and the same.

I am! I am! Thankful I am…

American by way of slave trade, revolutionary both in concept and conception, mentally and by way of actions. On this journey to regain knowledge of self and my original culture which is I- God culture. My most ancient and contemporary identity is one and the same, god of all creations. Thankful that my skin is original again, that my attraction for my luscious lipped, curvaceous muse and intelligent goddess counterpart is still my sisters, moors of all mothers wombs. Speaking to skintones from charcoal black to the lighterst gold all who were created independent and strong. Conscience of original beauty being their own nature. This is the reason why stranger tan, where make-up made with colors, pay for botox to fatten lips, hips, and shapely buttocks. All the while misleading the true goddesses of their intentions of being grafter back to original beings. They’ve got no virtue and history knows the meaning of virgin being All Natural. If you don’t believe me then ponder the meaning of virgin olive oil or virgin hair and you too will see that the only true virgins are my Black Madonna’s Auset who successfully reincarnates as mother, sister, lover, and motivating force of change in stages and degrees…

I am! I am! Thankful I am…

Imprisoned to be free, because in prison I gained my freedom. My thoughts and actions are my own, I am no longer an economic slave, a brand slave, an exploites nor am I willfully ignorant. I am a 40 year old incarnation of myself and I am…

Thankful I am!
