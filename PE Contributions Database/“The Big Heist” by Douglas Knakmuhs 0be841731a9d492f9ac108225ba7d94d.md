**“The Big Heist” by Douglas Knakmuhs**

“Let’s go over the plan again,” Ducky Fiddlesticks nervously said.

“We already went over it once before we left,” Foxy Redd stated, as he strained to push the cart. “Besides, all you gotta do is hide a few puppies under your feathers.”

“I know, but when I get nervous I get bad gas, and if I fart it’s gonna hit you in the mouth, and then we’re going to jail!”

“Okay, I’ll explain it one last time, and that’s it!” Foxy Redd screamed, as he continued to grunt while he pushed the cart along. “When we go into the pet shop and the owner looks the other way, we put one of the puppies under your feathers. I’m telling you it’s simple. You’re worried for no reason, my friend.”

“I know, but I’m starting to shed, and what if the stress is too much and I have no feathers left by the time we get to the store? Then what do we do?” Mr Fiddlesticks asked, while he cried.

“I’ll tell you what, Duck. If you ain’t got any feathers left by the time we get there, then we’ll turn around, go home, and you can shave a mohawk into my fur. Okay? Quit yakking, will ya?! You’re gonna make us late!”

Ducky continued to agonize over the part he was supposed to play. He just knew he was going to mess up somehow. If it wasn’t his feathers falling out, then it was going to be his gas that gave them away. He had bad luck.

They entered the pet store with thirty minutes left until closing time.

“Alright, Ducky, this is perfect! We got a mom and two kids at the cash register keeping the owner busy,” Foxy stated, as he pushed the cart towards the puppy section. “Just remember, take deep calming breaths, and this’ll be over in no time.”

“I know, but I’m really nervous, and I already lost two feathers!” Ducky exclaimed.

“Just remember, my friend, we’re doing these puppies a favor by setting them free,” the fox reminded Ducky.

At that same moment, one of the kids noticed Mr. Redd and Mr. Fiddlesticks, as they continued making their way to the puppy cage.

“Mom, can I have that duck?” The little boy asked.

“What duck, sweetie?” The mom asked, as she counted out her money to give to the store owner.

“The one in the cart!” The little boy said.

“Hey, I want the fox mom!” Said the little boy’s sister.

It was at this moment that Mr. Fox noticed the children’s keen interest in him and Mr. Fiddlesticks. He tried to hide the cart behind the puppy cage, but the little boy and girl refused to be deterred. To them it was a game of “Hide and Seek.” Then, the kids split up so that they could approach from both sides.

“We gotcha now!” The little girl screamed as they grabbed ahold of Redd and Ducky.

“Abort the mission! Abort the mission!” Mr. Fox screamed as the girl gave him a big bear hug.

“I got you now, and you’re all mine!” Screamed the little girl as she squealed with delight. She continued to giggle as she petted Mr. Fox.

“Mr. Fiddlesticks, gas these kids, and let’s scram!” Cried Mr. Fox.

But at that moment, the little boy was trying to ride poor Mr. Fiddlesticks like he was a bucking bronco at a rodeo. All Ducky could do was flap his little wings, sending feathers everywhere.

“Help! I need help on aisle two,” Ducky squacked as he tried to get away, but the little boy had a death grip around Ducky’s neck.

By now, the mother had run over to them, and she was swinging her purse at Mr. Redd and Mr. Fiddlesticks as she screamed, “Police! Someone call the police!”

Even the store owner was getting in on the action with a broom stick he had in his hands. He must have played baseball on the weekends because he had a heck of a swing on him. Back and forth the broom went until it finally knocked over the puppy cage, and puppies began to scatter everywhere.

It was at this point that the little children let go of Foxy and Ducky with a squeal of delight and began to chase after the puppies. Mom and the store owner continued to pummel the two intruders as they tried to run for their lives.

And that was when Mr. Fiddlesticks decided to pass gas. It was a silent one, but it was very effective. The humans all turned green and started gagging!

“Let’s get out of here, Ducky!” panted Foxy as the puppies followed them out the door. On and on they ran, and as they ran for the woods, twenty-seven puppies continued to chase after them. Into the woods they went. Eventually, they came to rest at a place in the woods that they both knew. They looked around at all the puppies and smiled.

“See, Mr. Fiddlesticks, I told you there was nothing to it,” he said as he began to laugh like never before.

And so went the “Big Heist of 2018.”
