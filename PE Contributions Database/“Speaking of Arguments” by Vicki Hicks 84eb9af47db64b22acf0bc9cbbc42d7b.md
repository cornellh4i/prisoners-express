**“Speaking of Arguments” by Vicki Hicks**

Speaking of arguments! I am not sure if you all know this, but I reside at camp prisonleyland with the one and only Catherine LeFleur. She is always after me to write and get the stories submitted me to write and get the stories submitted on time. The other day, Catherine handed me several stories for future publication. I read each and every one of them as soon as I got back to my dorm. I actually shared them with my bunkie because she wanted to know what I was laughing about. I ran into Catherine in the dining hall the next day and told her that I loved all of the stories and asked if she had received them from a fellow law clerk that I had given the stories to so she could return them to her. She said yes and then had the nerve to ask me if I actually read them or just sent them back. I promptly told her, of course I read them. She still did not believe me because she asked me, “okay, which one was your favorite?” Why else would she ask me that question? I loved all of them as you will when you read them. We have two different styles of writing so it was nice to have her critical eye look at the final product even though she rarely changes anything. I do not think she will every doubt that I read something she gave me to enjoy!
