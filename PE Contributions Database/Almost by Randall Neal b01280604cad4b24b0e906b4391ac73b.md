**Almost by Randall Neal**

Hello Friends! Today I’m writing to tell you how one girl’s heart revived a writer who almost died! As the story unfolds, I pray that your hearts will be filled with unfeigned love!

I was sitting in my six by ten prison cell staring out into a future of despair and brokenness. As a child, my dream had been to become a famous writer. At the tender age of eight, my secure cord of life was tragically cut. I entered a world where drugs and alcohol became my normal way of life, a world of uncertainty.

Unbeknownst at the time, stories were being built in the depths of my trials and tribulations. The day I was sentenced to prison, my heart was utterly broken. The writer inside me was almost dead. Yet my desires to help others nagged at the back of my mind. Characters began to emerge from the ashes of my ruin. Words began to flow from the depths of my pains onto the canvas of freedom. Thus, stories were born and sent out to family members, to unvisited churches, and yes, even to Prisoner Express. I entered various writing contests in hopes of being published, so the world could gain knowledge from my mistakes. For a solid year I wrote and sent, yet it all seemed to be in vain. My world of uncertainty became a world of hopelessness.

I began knocking on Heaven’s door, seeking to find help, asking God to intervene. The next day my name was called for mail. Mail? For me? The envelope contained a single sheet of paper with a single paragraph of words. They stretched into the depths of my despair and began pulling me back into the world of love! Tears of hope flowed from my heart as I read those simple words:

	*Dear Randall,*

*Hello, my name is Clara, writing to you from Prisoner Express. Your picture theme essay for August of last year was misplaced, so it had just arrived to me. I’m so sorry this wasn’t found earlier and put into the essay packet for that month. I still wanted to write to you because the story you wrote was so beautiful. I thought you might want to have your story back for safekeeping too. If at any point you get a chance to publish it, I really think you should take the opportunity. With a little bit of editing/polishing, this one will be a gem!*

	*Best Wishes,*

	*Clara*

My friends, my heart were literally transformed from stone to flesh as I cried. I could have sat there and read 10,000 more words from this stranger’s heart. Her gentle words danced on the stage of love, bringing kindness and encouragement into my world of bleak despair. Her honesty took captive my broken spirit. Her actions of unselfish love breathed a new breath of life into this almost dead writer! Her warmth embraced me with arms of hope. Out of the ashes I began to rise! A week later I had won the column writing contest for a magazine called “REDEEMED!” My award was $40 for my entry story and a guaranteed contract to write four more columns at $40 per entry. Grand total: $200. Not bad for a writer who was almost dead!

Though Clara hadn’t written 10,000 words of love, I’ve read her words of unfeigned love 10,000 times! Never let Satan kill you, my friends. Your words of love may be the words that breathe hope into someone else’s broken dreams. Now you’ve learned how one girl’s heart revived a writer who almost died! I want to thank you Clara, for your unselfish, unfeigned love for others. Though we will never meet, my heart thanks yours for lifting me out of the world of uncertainty, back into the world where love conquers all!
