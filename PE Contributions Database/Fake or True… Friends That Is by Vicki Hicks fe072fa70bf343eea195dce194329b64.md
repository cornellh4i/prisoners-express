**Fake or True… Friends That Is by Vicki Hicks**

In freedom, we do not necessarily take for granted the word “friend,” but the method and frequency with which we can reach out at any time. There are many levels of friendship. From passing by to deep and intimate. Being in prison, I think some people need someone to lean on so they bond what they hope is a good friendship. You quickly find that you cannot trust most of the people who call themselves your friend. When you truly find a lifelong friend, you will know it. Something in your heart feels different. Upon exiting the confines of the chainlink and razor wire, I will keep in touch with a handful of people that will be here for a bit longer. Some say that and they have good intentions, but life gets in the way. If you find a small group of true friends, don’t just say it, mean it. Do something special to show them you really do care and mean what you say. Don’t just say, “I will write” to say it. That makes you fake.

When I was arrested, the ones that I thought were my friends never showed up. The one person that is constant in my life other than family is someone I met in county jail. I receive a card and letter at least every other month. Sometimes she does not have a place to rest at night or food to eat and I still get a card and letter from her because she knows how important it is to keep your word. I consider her a true friend. I have met several people in prison that I will keep in touch with because I consider them true friends.

True friendship is hard to find, when you do, keep it safe; lock it away in your heart, your special treasure chest where you hold all of your special things that you hold dear.

Be a true friend!
