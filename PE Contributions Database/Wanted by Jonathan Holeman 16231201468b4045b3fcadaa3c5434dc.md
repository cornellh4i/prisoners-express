**"Wanted" by Jonathan Holeman**

Ridiculous, or maybe in a way, quite profound. As the years dwindle, like an all-consuming fire, fueled by faded memories and forgotten lusts, I find the reality that I only ever wanted a woman, who loved me enough to cook me breakfast in the morning.

Her looks were never much of grand importance. This is because, all women, have some striking feature, a beauty that proves a mystical mysterious desire.

For some it's just a simple movement. The way she walks, a dance so beauteously bold and vibrant that it shines as a light through the dark storm clouds raining down on an old man's broken blackened heart.

Her fashion sense can be bright and bold. Sundresses, sun hats, showing sunshine's rays across the days in ways only a vision can hold. She can be soft and comfortable, in sweatpants, cotton shirts, and sandals, sweet and warm a little cuddle filled princess. Conservative striking down stereotypes that suits can't be sultry. She can wear anything in anyway, and more than all that’s shown above.

For others it's their golden, auburn, brown, scarlet, rose, jet black, or blonde and shimmering hair, in locks, in tatters. Braided, permed, straight, curled, bouncy, full, thick, floating, feathered, fettered, nappy, short, long, pixie, styled in any way that fits her mood.

Her beauty might be in a simple feature. A curved or sculpted body. Sometimes hard and muscled, or soft, smooth, or anyway she wants or is. Her face can have a hidden trove of expression. Curves and grins, dimpled smiles. Full, thin lips of delightful jawlines and arches. Drowning in those round, almond, slanted, oval, pools of brown, hazel, blue, green shades of eyes.

As age pushes on, like a train without a brake, rolling downhill tracks, there's a more attractive quality to a woman. One that surpasses any tests of wrinkles found in time. Deep down within her heart, her thoughts, her mind, is the true beautiful river flowing through her actions. A trove of treasure to be measured, counted, stored, spent wisely, and saved. Every hidden beauty studied shows throughout her smile, her rolling eyes, arching eyebrows, things she says, she does, the way she moves, the way her hair flicks, the clothes, and styles she wears. It's in the way she carries on a conversation, presents her simple truth.

I might've found her in the shadows, behind an invisible mask, a veil I should've lifted. My selfish pride, and unrealistic exaggeration of the Adonis I was not, helped me fail to see them all underneath that made up shining shell. Anyone could've been the one to make those breakfasts, if only I’d been paying attention.
