“I sing the body electric… Head, Neck, Hair, Ears, drop and tympan of the ears, Eyes, eye fringes, iris of the eyes, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, Mouth, tongue, lips, Teeth, roof of the Mouth, Jaws, and the Jaw Hinges, Nose, Nostrils of the nose, and the partition… The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, the marrow in the bones, The exquisite realisation of Health; O I say these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the soul, O I say now these are the are the soul.”

Walt Whiteman “Leaves of Grass” 1981, 112-115

**“The Fox and the Goose” by Jeremy Brown**

“Come on Mr. Fox. I know you have the strength to push an old Goose back to her home.” 

“I’m trying my dear old Goose but I fear my muscles just are too small to fit the enormous task at hand,” the Fox spoke, squeezing his eyes in feigned pain and effort. 

“Fox, now don’t ire to me or I shall not give thee tea nor crumpets to smack your greedy lips upon. I know you need the nourishment you’ve lost a tremendous amount of weight. I implore of you as to why?” Goose quacked in a motherly fashion. 

“Well, my dear Goose, I’ve recently stopped eating meat. I’m trying this new seeds of the Earth fruits of the Tree dietary supplementation as well,” Fox spoke licking his lips. 

“Well what?" 

“Well I’ll show you. Just let me push you into this forest clearing and we will take a break”. 

All of a sudden, Mr. Fox and Ms. Goose came upon a clearing. Fox had a sudden bout of fortitude from within. Or perhaps he went without meat for so long. The tastiness of Goose flesh may have been haunting him and helped give his muscles that extra boost of vitality, to push the goose into a secret clearing. 

“Well, this is a tight spot,” said Ms. Goose. 

Just as Ms. Goose looked the other way, Fox bared his fangs and snapped them are the goose’s long tasty neck!

 “Oooo yes, the taste of a goose’s flesh is most satisfying,” said Mr. Fox, licking the blood dripping from his snout. Mr. Fox could not control his hunger for meat. 

It was not until the next day that he began thinking of all of the wonderful moments he had shared with Ms. Goose, and her most dearest kindness unto him. He started to cry and wail and beat the ground with his fists. 

“What is wrong, Mr. Fox? I am here." The Goose’s dear old spirit was behind him. 

“Oh Ms. Goose, my only friend, I am so sorry I have killed and eaten thee. Will you find it in your heart to forgive me?” 

“Yes my dear Fox, I forgive you and will always love you. I know you could not control your animal instinct. I sacrificed myself so that you may live and have meat on your bones. That is how much I love you Mr. Fox.” 

Fox missed his dear friend Goose so much that he stopped eating altogether and held his friend's corpse for so long until he died a hungersome death. Both Goose and Fox were reunited on the Astral Plane above the Earth and played Hide ‘N Go Seek and Tag at light speed. It was so much fun being in the Afterlife, thought Mr. Fox and Ms. Goose. They played and played until it was time to reincarnate into the human family. When Goose and Fox reincarnated, both were dear brother and sisters and helped each other once again, except this time, Fox was an old man in a wheelchair and goose was pushing his decrepit booty around the whole time. 

“I guess we are old once again Goose, do you plan on getting your revenge on me, an old man?” 

“No,” said the Old goose woman, “I have a better idea. Since we are old and decrepit we will go skydiving but without a parachute and dance and flip in the air into our most exciting deaths! I know you are not afraid, have we not played with dear old Grim Reaper before?” 

“Yes, you are right you old Goose." 

The Grim Reaper himself appeared before them shaking his head back and forth. “Ah, the cunning Fox and Mother goose. Once again playing with the idea of Death, are we hmmm hmmm?” 

“Oh there, you are old Grim. I was afraid but it’s just an old friend, are you going to take us then? Or shall we take ourselves out to the Afterlife?” 

“I could make it painless for both of you. I could snap your cerebellum with a flick of the wrist, but no, I shall not deprive you of your last joy. I give you permission. Go ahead, jump out of a plane and skydive without a parachute, I’ve seen much worse. Just do me a favor and do it over the ocean. It’s less messy that way, plus my young daughter Kali doesn’t need to see blood yet.” 

“Wow, the Grim Reaper finally has a daughter?” said Fox. 

“Yes, I married Haes ex-wife, Hell, and we had Kali. She’ll be a Goddess of Death someday.” 

So Fox and Goose got into an old retired B-52 Bomber, jumped out, held each other and danced with Death. When they were on the Astral Plane, they both decided to build their very own planet. They both graduated to become a Celestial Planetary Architect. Yet, to each other, they were the same Goose and Mr. Fox. They built their planet together so they could watch the drama unfold in millions of ways. Yet, they first had to learn Universal Super Particle Planetary Physics to organize and structure the subatomic particles into a cohesive whole. 

“Why Mr. Fox, it looks to me like the lumps of atoms you had yesterday is starting to look like a swath of land.” 

“Thank you Goose, I think I’m getting the hang of it. Every time I look away, the atomic particles react in different ways unexpectedly.” 

“Well, you need to learn more of the uh, uncertainty principle and Chaos Theory, as well, to get your particulates in order,” said Goose matter of factly.

Author’s Note: I let my automatic handwriting, metaphysics and imagination run wild. Plus I had a lot of laughs. You've got to make death funny because it's all around us and it’s such a gruesome subject. Our society tries to hide it. But there's so much to do after we are gone. We've really only just begun our ascension. So I tried to make it fun and represent that here.
