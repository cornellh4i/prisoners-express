**Unbroken by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

My scars tell a story… indeed, they do and what a story it is. Decorating my body are some 197 scars. One hundred and ninety seven momentos. Almost 200 tallies left by experience. Lady Fortune is kind, but her sister, Madame Victory is a sadist of sorts.

One hundred and ninety seven. More scars than even the most daring aspire to. More than most can conceive of. Each scar tells a tale, a challenge confronted, a battle conquered, a certain death defied. Take the dozen forget-me-nots left on my chest, upper arms and back from my opposition the last time they tried to kill me. The couple dozen coating my fists I got from picking on school yard bullies and railing against the depravity of the Penal Institution. The shattered foot I walked home on. The bullets that seared my flesh, unable to end my life. The many times I've been outnumbered and bled or blood I shed for La Causa.

These scars, my scarred flesh, give testimony to a life lived in the struggle. My trophies, etched in knitted flesh, crisscross my body from head to foot. All these reminders are clear evidence of the lives I survived, war I;ve waged and opponents denied their victories. My scars whisper a soft poem-

To wage this life means years beyond the bone

War without cease- a peaceful hunger- end Dream;

Melancholy Jay, our trophies etched by tears

Memory, the Hauntings, mementos of Madame Victory.

De Rerum Beli, the things of War. Laurels may dry and crumble to dust. Ribbons and medals unravel and tarnish with time. Morals and standards, convictions and principles. Honor, respect, pride, and loyalty; gifts of Lady Fortune, by which a warrior encounters the strength to preserve and continue. Experience, hard-earned knowledge, and scars, the only presents of Madame Victory.

But, alive I am and a victory it is. I’ve been run over, beaten, stabbed, shot multiple times and survived Death not just once but theice. Some may see my marked and tattered canvases of flesh and feel pain or sympathy. Others may see it as a monument to human resilience surviving the worst life has to offer. I see it in simpler terms.

My scars tell a story… They’re reminders of when life tried to break me and failed.
