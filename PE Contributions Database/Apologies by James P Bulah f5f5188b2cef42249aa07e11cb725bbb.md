**“Apologies” by James P. Bulah**

I Apologize

Many times

Our conversations ended

Our letters ended

Our words end

I Apologize

For not

Knowing Better

Doing Better

Learning Better

Listening Better

Loving Better

I Apologize

For not

Being there

Waiting there

Staying there

I Apologize

For not

Wanting more

Needing more

Helping more

Caring more

Sharing more

Believing more

I hope in time,

My Apologies will

Create

Wait

Redeem

Reconcile

Restore

Forgive

Forget

Fulfill

Before the time to Apologize is lost!
