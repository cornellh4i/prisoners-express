**“I Say This From My Heart” by Nate Lindell**

Over fifteen years ago, based on a guard’s lie, I was in seg at the Waupun Correctional Institute. Most of the inmates around me were driven insane by the stark conditions and the constant projections of hate from the staff. They would spend their days and nights yelling threats and insults at each other, sometimes staff, and spit at each other while in rec. We were given gristly “meat” and canned, greasy or starchy everything else to slop on. In the summer we had no AC, just hot air blowing in the vents that stank like the pile of cow shit that had been dumped around the intake made life miserable.

Then I read *Andersonville*, a book about a POW camp ran by the Confederacy (it’s one of the books every prisoner must read, like *Papillon*, *The Count of Monte Christo*, and *1984*). Those prisoners---whew!--they had it rough! I became grateful for the gristly meat, bland cake and soap-water-tasting stew I was fed, and for my relatively sanitary surroundings and clean drinking water.

Not so much for the maniacs around me, many of whom had release dates, family, friends and money that I wouldn’t dream of, because to dream of money would only remind me of its absence. Rather than effectively/rationally resisting the PIC, those around me focused on degrading each other, putting another prisoner down automatically meant that they must be happy---this is akin to prisoncrats concluding that they must be good because we are evil.

Some of us, I believe, are prone to be grateful, a component of optimism, while others are prone contrariwise. I also believe that, through practice, we can grow more grateful, more hopeful, and more optimistic, as you’ll see in many Christians.

Gratitude makes you pleasant to be around, which is extremely offensive to the PIC, as the PIC needs to make us look unpleasant to be around, worthy of caging (hence ugly uniforms, denial of razors in seg, etc.). Optimism, including gratitude, moves the revolution forward. What can be more revolutionary than demonstrating that you’re a decent human, when prisoncrats, judges, and the media insists and wishes otherwise?

“The best revenge is massive success”--- Frank Sinatra.

There are people we owe gratitude to right now:

- The prisoner who showed you kindness recently
- Friends and family who care about you
- *Maybe* a humane prison staffer
- Prison abolitionists and supporters, such as PE volunteers

“People will forget what you said...what you did, maybe, but...will never forget how you made them feel”--Maya Angelou

We can make people feel good. Listen, we’ve all had hardships. I promise you mine have been vicious and numerous, long before I came to prison, probably why I came to prison, and probably why some of you did too. Nobody gave a fuck in the system; they just groomed us for the prison cells they had waiting for us. But we can give a fuck, and not give a fuck that giving a fuck seems hopeless!

Some people and things I’m grateful for to the point of tears are:

- Pen pals I’ve met, known, and lost over the years. They shared themselves with me and let me be a human
- The people at BetweentheBars.org, who run my blog, allowing me to tell my story: [http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540](http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540)
- Gary Fine, for starting PE and to all its volunteers!
- These fine writers who have stunned me with their brutal honesty (Sean Poulton’s facing Fear essay), their heart (for the “grandparents” topic, SHannon Richardson and Marvin Jones; “Nicknames” topic, Sarah Luedecke; “Leap of Faith”, Kwaneta Harris and Michael Morales), their insight into human nature (“Masks” by Charles Yonkings; “Leap of Faith,” Robert McCracken; “Facing Fear,” Eugene Youngblood), their resistance to the PIC (“Facing Fear,” J Bauhaus; “Modern Day Explorers,” Carl Branson---ya can’t touch me thp’ on viciousness in court!), their wicked satire (both “Docket Call” and “Churchy People” by Matthew Tomlinson), their dark humor/truth (“Introducing Diagonal Taboo” by Matthew Tomlinson; “Tic, Tac, Ticken’ in His Head,” by Michael Lanning; “The Suffering,” Daniel Matthews---all accurately depict how prison warps minds), their light-hearted humor (“Facing Fear,” Catherine LaFleur).

I’m grateful I’m not alone, and I hope you are too.

“I say this from my heart” as Tommy Pitera once told me, even though the PIC claims I have none.
