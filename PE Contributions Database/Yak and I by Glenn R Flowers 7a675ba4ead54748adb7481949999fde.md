**Yak and I by Glenn R. Flowers**

The element of beauty one still can bring to the mind is euphoric. It simply amazed me how one still can be the roadway in traveling the depths of the subconscious mind. It brings about an innocence child-like to be able to imagine what some deem for fetched and fictitious. But anything given energy or power can become surreal. Loneliness can be beautiful, just as much as it is peaceful. Being an introvert, I submerge oneself into the still as the last of mankind on this frontier. Nobody in sight, just me and my beautiful Yak. She understands me, and I understand her. We’re in unison the world world and one another. She is looking for a provider and that I canker with food and water. And I’m looking for someone who can accept me and my baggage. That's not an issue for her. There’s nothing awkward about the silences we share. So they’re always welcomed. She looks back at me and says a mouth full with her eyes. “Are you ready to conquer this beautiful world in front of us?” I couldn’t be more ready. The past was so dark and unsteady but the future looks so promising. I have no desire to look back. We will move forward one step at a time. The mind is the heart, the hand is the body, the pen is the talent and the paper is the world. This is my way of exploring.
