**Cancer by D.W. Johnston**

An awfully prescient topic given the current affairs of the world. Like you all, I’m a badass. I have survived the end of the world a few times now, and also several civilizations destroying plagues. Y2K? The worst part of that was the hangover. That 2012 Mayan thing? Not a scratch. Swine flu, Bird flu, West Nile? I actually did get swine flu. Despite the fear mongering media, I don’t recall it being any worse than any other flu.

Last year they told me I have cancer. Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma they called it. Not everyone is so lucky. Highly treatable (yet still no cure for cancer). A couple surgeries and some radiation and I’m good as new. I’m almost forty and I’m on meds that give me the metabolism of a teenager. Takes some adjustment and resilience and avoiding the urge to eat everything. The radiation was nothing, even at a pretty high dose. I didn’t feel anything. My pee didn’t glow int he dark. I didn’t glow in the dark. I didn’t get super powers. These are the things I asked before swallowing the capsules that came hidden in a large lead Easter egg.

I am getting back to normal fairly quickly. Lost a lot of weight, both muscle and fat, being laid up during it all. But I’m resilient. And while there is no cure, they assure me they can keep me healthy long enough to die of something else. Maybe even coronavirus.

My apologies for a brief digression. I despise the perversion of language. Whenever I have someone refer to me as a cancer “survivor” I have to correct them and say “no, I’m not”. I guess my cancer could have been life threatening had it been let go much longer, but it wasn’t. And I think it takes away a lot from people who are actually fighting a life or death struggle against cancer and other diseases. Like using the word war to describe things that are not wars.

We prisoners have a limited view of what’s going on out in the world, and we haven’t had to endure the same hardships and privations. We have a warehouse full of TP and other things here. Though the commissary had to limit ramen noodles to twelve per person. The horror! Chow takes a bit longer, only seating two to a table. But they are still feeding us the same (Thanks Texas). Everywhere we normally stand in line now has dots painted on the ground six feet apart for us to stand on. All the officers have been wearing masks since early April. And they recently gave all of us here on Allred unit two masks. They must be worn at all times outside the cell. Visits have been suspended. Limited movement between units. We have been getting two fifteen minute phone calls per week for free. As far as we know there have not been any cases on this unit.

Life will go on, soon we’ll be back to normal, and in a few months “Corona Virus” won’t even be part of your vocabulary.

Then we can get on with the next doomsday scenario. Aren’t we expecting Asteroid (Apophos) soon?
