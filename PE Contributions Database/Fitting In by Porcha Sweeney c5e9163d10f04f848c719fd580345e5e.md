Who doesn't want to fit in, except the outcast and the rebel? From religion to style to class, or just plain being accepted many want to fit in.

So not fitting in is to be unaccepted, pushed away or even scorned. Take the gutter youth. He doesn't have the proper finances to purchase nice "name brand" clothes like the privileged youth so he learns to steal. Rob. Sell drugs.

Ah, is it hard to believe that many humans are made criminal monsters by circumstance?

What about the non-handsome youth, or the man who inflicted self-mutilation to his emotions just to fit in the eyes of his beautiful dreams? Yes, fitting in can be easy as sweet orange juice poured into a cup. And then it can be s distressful as losing your first child.

The two words "fitting in" don't sound as harmful as AIDS, being run over, or suicide, but disaster has kissed the souls of many human beings because of these small words: "Come on man, do it," "If you love me," "Everybody else is doing it." They are all styles of coaxing you to (yep, you know it) fit in. There's always a price to fitting in and some will not respect the change they will receive.

Yeah, just like the most silly and ludicrous concepts that the "educated" people come up with; if your mind is deep enough even fitting in can be rationalized. Trust me. If I caught your attention for a second or maybe a minute, go ahead and smile for me because you just fit in to what I needed.

Don't worry though because I'm smiling too. Oh, and as we say in the ghetto: get in where YOU fit in. I ya (means "I live").
