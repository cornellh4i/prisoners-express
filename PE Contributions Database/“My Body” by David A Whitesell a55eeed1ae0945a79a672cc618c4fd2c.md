**“My Body” by David A Whitesell**

One Nation Under God so it is said

One Soul’s of your Feet, Ruff and as tough as the Heart

The U.S.A. only Nation in the world

One Nation Under God, care custody, control My Body

Someone Else’s temple

My Feet as a newborn Body of a Babies sold into The System of Man’s Slavery,

Government My world in the Palms of their Hand visions of Black ink rubbed on the souls of my newborn feet, as a Baby I elude even gravity

My Body a Branch only to grow from some family tree it strikes me footprints, those in the sand, an unknown author a poem once wrote, Christ walked with a troubled Man, He Remembers seeing only one set of prints

The question why?

Jesus Replied that is when I carried you, I learned By Now But is it too late another number old age a Body of Government will Bow when a King Roars FREE the SLAVES can this Be Sure your government Stole My life with a Fake Black ink paper tattoo.

And a Number Remember

This is My Body

My Body

My Body will

Really it is

God’s just occupying space in My Body

Here on Earth the temple of Christ My Body
