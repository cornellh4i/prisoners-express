**“Flowers” by Martin Vicario**

I love flowers! Flowers take me instantly to my days in college, living on the second floor that overlooked several flowerbeds. I had a huge window that gave me an advantage to see the flowers, but it also allowed me to catch the sunsets. Sometimes I would gaze at those sunsets for a long time and see a rainbow of colors develop as the sun slowly set behind the horizon. During those moments, hundreds of thoughts would be scrambling through my mind…. I would think about my wife, how she glowed every time she worked her flowerbed and garden. What a beautiful woman, she moved so gracefully with the earth. It’s been some time ago. I gather those memories and store them in my heart, just to pull them out from time to time and reminisce.

I also think about flowers in the circus. However, the flowers I am referring to are not flowers, but people. Everyone has something positive and beautiful about themselves. The thing with pop culture is that not everyone measures up to the standards Hollywood and fashion magazines put out. People, like flowers, plain and simple, are interesting. People have their own smell, their own smile, and their own unique way of being. Flowers in the circus. Is the circus made up of freaks? Are prisons made up of freaks? How about hospitals and retirement homes? I don't think so! I think all these places are fields of flowers with rainbows of colors and stories that would fill a library for eternity.

I would walk to campus and look forward to seeing the flowers-- there was always a fresh flower blooming, in particular, the roses. I liked checking out those pansies, marigolds, and geraniums. The thing is, I love flowers. Right before I would enter the school building, there was a rose bush I would talk to, and take in her sweet rosy scent. As the weather grew colder, I recall the flowers losing petals, and coming back to life as the climate became warmer. It went on like this, the flowers and me, as I completed a bachelor’s degree, and then graduate school. All those years they brought peace, color, and hope to my life. I could count on them to be there the following season, and they were, without fail. I finally moved on, but I never imagined that I would be reminiscing about the flowers that graced my life so many years ago. I wonder if those flowers are still there? ...And there she was as she worked her garden and flower bed, busy and focused. I was also focused, but on her. I never anticipated that would be the last time I’d see my wife among the flowers… soft, sweet, and forever gentle on my mind.
