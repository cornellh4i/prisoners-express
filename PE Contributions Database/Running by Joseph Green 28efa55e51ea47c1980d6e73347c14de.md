**Running by Joseph Green**

It had been raining all morning and the heavy thwack of my shoes hitting the saturated pavement was narcotic. The icy drops prickled my face and arms, creating the illusion they were asleep; but I was farm from asleep. Arms and legs pumping like four finely tuned pistons caused my mind to rev with combustive thought.

I thought about the water, how the falling drops surrendered their shape to my form; but also how - with enough concentration and pressure - a stream of water can cut clean through steel and stone. I ran through a puddle and noted its lack of resistance to my weight. Instead of fighting me for that space, it merely deferred, humbly returning as I left. I thought too how water is not always so accommodating. It can be immensely destructive, laying waste to entire civilizations.

Later I would read this quote:

“The highest motive is to be like water. Water is essential to all living things, yet it demands no pay or recognition. Rather it flows humbly to the lowest level. Nothing is weaker than water, yet for overcoming what is hard and strong, nothing surpasses it.” - Tao Te Ching; Lao-Tzu

…

“I can’t run anymore,” wheezed the man jogging next to me, “I gotta stop.” He’d already given up and was slowing.

“No!” I urged, strangely inspired to be inspirational. “You’ve got more,” I breathed out heavily, “You just gotta dig down and find it.” I lifted my eyes in search of a marker we could strive for.

“The goal post!” I said excitedly, “C’mon, we can make it to the next goal post!”

With a reluctant grunt, the man reengaged his muscles, and we painfully trotted in silence to the mark.

This experience taught me two basic life principles. First, that I have - as all do - the power to influence another. This may seem so obvious it’s not worth stating.

“You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.” - Jane Goodall

Another principle I’ve learned this endurance race called life however, says, “You cannot see things till you know roughly what they are” (C.S. Lewis; Out of the Silent Planet). Much of what we know through vague impressions escapes our ability to apprehend until we can define it.

The second thing I discovered is that all difficult journeys seem hopeless without a goal to set our minds upon; but with such a goal we’re able to endure far more affliction than we previously thought possible. Mankind is notorious for reaching the lofty ambitions upon which he sets his heart.

If in this current leg of your race you find your strength failing, might I suggest lifting the eyes of your soul to scan the horizon for an object after which you can strive? And once you have it, mount up like a fierce tsunami that you may reach. Then find another, till you have crossed the finish line victorious. You may feel spent, but you’re not! There is power in you yet undiscovered; you need only choose to mine the silvery veins of your soul.

Jesus of Nazareth had a tough race to run. It was full of hardship, suffering and grief. The path of His journey ran right through the cross! His strategy for victory? “For the joy set before Him, Christ endured the cross… and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God” (Hebrews 12:2). His race was arduous. To win the prize Jesus set His hope on the joy His victory would accomplish. We too can win, if we follow Him.
