***The Most Interesting Girl in the World* by Delvin Diles**

****“I’m just sayin’!” Jess was full throttle now, no stopping her. She had Michelle rollin’.

“Why would he do that?! It a waste of money, right?! ‘Spose to be the Most Interesting Man, but you make the Most Stupidest Travel Pick: Mars?!”

Jess kept hypothesizing, “No restaurants. No hotels. No nothing but red dirt and space rovers. He’d be better off comin’ here to Phoenix for some fun with us, know what I’m sayin’?”

Michelle grinned in agreement, “Now you’re talking!”

“But nah, he already blasted off with those high-maintenance brauds. They’ll nag him back to Earth for sure!” Michelle laughed.

“Well he’d better tough it out up there now, though. Hell, with Trump as President, I’m tryin’ to figure a way up there because we’re so screwed,” Jess concluded, looking up wistfully at the sky, to a much better place.
