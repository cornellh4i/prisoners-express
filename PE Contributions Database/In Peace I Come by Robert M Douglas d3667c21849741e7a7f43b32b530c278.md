***In Peace I Come* by Robert M. Douglas**

Out of the waters, I raise my hands and stretch toward the heavens. Some may say I have lost my mind along the way, but that’s untrue. I just happened to find direction, peace, and happiness. All in all, I finally found the real me. I stopped caring about the laughter that was about me and started caring about how I can make the world a better place today. It’s been 10 years since I first walked out of these waters, realizing peace was what we needed. We don’t need wars or weapons of mass destruction, but rather a lot of love and more hugs. Could you imagine being in a world where a gun is a foreign object from another planet? How about a murder being as rare as hell freezing over? This is the ideal way of life that deep down, we know we need. This would completely end all the over-population of jails, institutions, and the graveyards! To some people, it may seem pointless to do what I do, but to me, it’s not, and that’s all that really matters. All I can say is instead of putting your hands up in surrender to the police, put your hands up high above your head as you enter a neighborhood that is in ruin because of violence, and say just four simple words: in peace I come.
