**by Robert Neely**

Alex and I were assholes. I can’t sugarcoat it.

Neither of us were friendly unless we had a few drinks in us. I remember, it was a night like most others. We’d been drinking and waxing philosophical…actually we were talking shit about our close circle of friends. “Sheep, that’s what they are.”

“How is that?” I responded.

“Well,” Said Alex, “It doesn’t matter what we do, Dayna, V, and all the rest of them do whatever we tell them to do. I’ll prove it!”

Then Alex divulged his master plan. He felt like we could get the group to ditch our real names and start calling us by whatever nickname we gave ourselves. Now keep in mind these people had known us for years. I was married to Dayna.

Of course we couldn’t name ourselves. It would be bad luck or something like that. We would come back the next day with our decision. I decided to call him BOOM! It was his personality. He was brash and overbearing. We met at a Walmart employee training. He knocked in the door like a winter gale on a screen door.

I never told him why, just BOOM. He called me Skratch, yes with a ‘k’ because it was douche-y. I never asked why Skratch, but he was right. They were sheep.

To this day people still call me Skratch. I was married twice and both wives called me Skratch.

I introduce myself as Robert. I am tired of being an asshole. Robert is a nice guy, a good man. Skratch should stay on the train platform as I continue forth on my going.

BOOM is still himself. I pray for him to find Alex. Alex sounds like he could be a pretty nice guy.
