**“Long 4” by Never B. Famous (Mark Hawkins)**

Oh for this do I long.

So with these words out my heart,

To you, I pour. Despite explaining this

Truth only causes me to suffer more. How lucky some are,

To never feel this kind of pain. My longing in a poem.

Will it be in vain? I’ll never see your love, smiling back at me.

Robbed of the joy of your accomplishment yet to be.

<~Longing 4 ~>

No chance to hold you in my arms, a piece of me.

Absence gave birth to the words you see. I’ll never make it

To your game, I have to miss the world chanting your name.

Yes I long but it’s for what can never be, with tears in my

Eyes I accept life, destined for me.

All your dreams and desires, sadly I’ll never know.

No memories of what, I could have seen you, to grow.

How lonely life has become longing for you, my sole desire,

That I’ll never see come true. Oh, I don’t think you can

Understand because you’ve got your own. It’s like I planted my

Seeds in a beautiful garden, but still nothing has grown.

This is the longing that I must bear, I know I can’t say

I’m not living, but to me it’s like, I can’t breathe your air.

I poured out my heart, just as I swore,

Now the question I ask you. What Do I Long 4?
