**“Night of Fun” by Shannon Richardson**

Man, what was I thinking! I can’t believe the messes I get myself into! All for a night of fun.

My name is Roger and I’m nineteen years old. I like to drink and party once in awhile. The problem is I’m not old enough to drink. Most of the time, one of my older friends buys the drinks and there’s no problem. That doesn’t work if you want to go out.

My friend, Dan, was getting married. He was a couple of years older than me, but we were always tight growing up. He lived a couple of houses down from me and we were always together.

When it came time for Dan’s bachelor party, no way was I going to back out just because of my age. I tried to get a fake I.D., but even I could tell how fake that thing was.

My brother, Darrell, left home about a year ago. He didn’t give us a reason and he didn’t tell us bye; he was just gone. I think my parents knew more than they let on because every time his name came up, my father got angry and my mother cried. I think my mother knows where he is and sneaks out to see him sometimes. Either that, or she is sneaking food, clothes, and other stuff out to someone else.

Anyway, Darrell is a few years older than me - plenty old enough to go drinking. I remembered seeing his license the last time I was in his room. He had left it in the wooden tray on his dresser. Sure enough, there it was. I figured what would it hurt - it wasn’t like he was using it!

So I borrowed my brother’s license (and some of his clothes) and headed out for the night. I told my parents I wouldn’t be home until the next day. They thought I was hanging out at Dan’s house. I believe my mother had a bad feeling because she grabbed me into a tight hug. That was unlike my mom.

The night started out great. There were six of us in the car that night. We went to Dave’s Bar on the corner of seventh street and had a couple of beers. It was great to get together with my friends and celebrate Dan’s upcoming marriage.

I was driving on the way to our next destination when we were pulled over. The cop suspected I was drinking and driving. That turned out to be the least of my worries.

I handed him my license...or so I thought. What I actually handed him was my brother’s license. I left mine at home.

When the cop came back to the car, his gun was drawn - and pointed at me. I didn’t understand what was happening. I had never been in trouble before. The next thing I know, I was being cuffed and put in the back of the cop’s car. I only had two beers, so I knew I wasn’t drunk. It just didn’t make any sense to me!

Well, it turns out that my brother left home for a reason. He was a draft dodger. He had been drafted into the war, but he ran. When they ran his license, this information came up. I kept telling them it was my brother but they didn’t believe me. Honestly, I think as long as they had a body - any body - they didn’t care.

I was sent to the closest army base and waited to be shipped out. In the meantime, I was made to participate in boot camp and training.

I’m in the picture you’re looking at. I’m at the end of the first row. I have my hands together because I was praying for a way out of the mess I had gotten myself into. That was the last picture ever taken of me. I never did make it home - not alive, anyway. To think, all of this happened all for a night of fun.
