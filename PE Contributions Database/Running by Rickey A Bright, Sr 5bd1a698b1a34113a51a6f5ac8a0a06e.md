**Running by Rickey A. Bright, Sr**

In 1955, I climbed out of my playpen and hit the ground running . Like the iconic Energizer Bunny, I’m still going. My race began in earnest when - at the age of four - I ran out of the house behind my beloved grandmother fully expecting to go for a car ride. In those days, a car ride took second place only to grandma, the woman who practically raised me from the day my mom brought me home from the hospital.

Much to my dismay, grandma wouldn’t let me go with her. My little heart shattered, its pieces lying all around me on the cold sidewalk.

Shedding crocodile tears, I begged her not to leave me behind. In the end, I lost my appeal to accompany grandma - the woman I loved more than chocolate - to her mother’s house. She sent me back inside, promising to return soon. Soon? What is soon to a four year old if not an eternity?

Crying, I stood in the doorway and watched grandma slowly drive away with my heart. She turned onto Clinton Avenue and disappeared from sight, but not my mind.

In my mind’s eye, I saw the route grandma would travel, and realized I knew the way to Ma’s house. I don’t know what my mom was doing at the time, but I walked out and began my first journey out into the world alone. Soon, I was walking along Kanawha Turnpike, which is a narrow two-lane road with a 45 mph speed limit.

Since it was the fall of the year, many sights begged to be explored in the naked woods on the opposite side of the highway, but I didn’t slow to watch the playful squirrels as they scampered tree to tree while gathering their winter meals, and didn’t stop to ring the bell in the Methodist Church’s towering steeple.

At Chestnut Street, I turned right and continued my grandma-chasing journey until I came to the railroad crossing where a slow freight train delayed my progress for the longest time. As soon as the train rumbled past, I crossed the four sets of tracks and continued on my merry way - until I reached the Spring Hill Bakery.

No boy can pass up the sweet aroma of hot, fresh donuts and cakes and pies and cinnamon. I stopped and stared hungrily at those big glass windows at the display cases filled with mouth-watering treats: donuts of every shape, size, color, and flavor known to little boys; cream horns, cinnamon rolls, cherry pies, birthday cakes, chocolate cakes, and more. My blue eyes were bigger than my stomach, and my pockets empty. If only grandma was here, I thought, I would have one of those delicious cream horns.

Saddened by my lack of a tasty pastry, I continued my journey. I ran into trouble; however, the moment I crossed Kentucky Street and strolled right past the school crossing officer, who thought I belonged in school.

“Hey,” she called to me, “where are you going?”

“To Ma’s house.”

“Aren’t you supposed to be in school?”

“No, ma’am.”

I could tell she had reservations about a little boy running around by himself. She buttoned up my coat while questioning me, but ultimately allowed me to continue on my misguided journey.

I walked to MacCorkle Avenue - better known as U.S. Route 60 - where I had to cross four lanes of traffic on South Charleston’s main thoroughfare. Barely able to reach the crosswalk button, I pressed it and waited for the speeding traffic to come to a halt. I’m sure some of the drivers were mortified to see a four year old cross the highway alone, but no one voiced any concerns.

I was now two-thirds of the 25 blocks to Ma’s. I picked up my pace because the air was biting cold when semis blew past at 55 mph. Ten minutes later I walked into Ma’s house and horrified everyone.

In hindsight, I risked my life just to be with grandma, but I’d do it all over again for just one more of grandma’s loving hugs. I love you and miss you Grandma. I can’t wait to see your open arms in Heaven, and you know I’ll be running.
