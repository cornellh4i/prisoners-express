**"Peace" by Darrell Ballard**

What does one feel with wet sand between one’s toes?

What does one feel with the ocean breeze upon one’s face?

What does one feel with the salty smell upon one’s nose?

What does one do with such a beautiful place?

A man walks across the deserted beach, enjoying the breeze upon his face and the smell of salt water playing with his senses. The water is smooth with only the slightest of ripples caused by fish and the hungry seagulls who feast upon them. It is like music to one’s ears, but who does the man give thanks to for such a song? Is it: Allah, God, Buddha, Neptune, Poseidon, or just plain Mother Nature? Whoever it may be, the man is glad.

Sand soon leaves and stone steps take its place. The man quietly bows down and rinses his feet of sand. There was no need to dirty such a place of purity. Slowly, the man makes his way up the steps, enjoying the full sobering effect the place had upon him.

Atop the steps stood a small shack circled by trees. This was the man’s destination. This was his home away from home. A place he could come to and remove the shadows of society from his body. The stress of being a father and a husband. The pain from a full-time job. The built-up anger towards those who oppose his way of life. All soon to be washed away with the outgoing tide.

Entering the shack, the man sits upon the floor and lets the noises of the natural world wash over him. The cries of the gulls as they search for food. The rustles of leaves as the wind blows through them. The splashes of the water as it pushes its way onto the beach and against his sanctuary. All playing their part in creating a symphony.

Slowly, the man lets go and being to rock with the trees as if he too were moved by the wind. Slowly, he relaxes and soon feels...peace.
