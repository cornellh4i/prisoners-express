**“Facing My Fears” by William Earl Hill**

What an interesting topic about which to write. Facing fears. We all have them, and they are all real to the person who has them. Even though I may not be able to understand why a certain situation or thing would cause trepidation to someone else it is a very real thing to them.

I know people who have a great fear of heights, though I have never been affected by that particular phobia. I once worked as a window washer on skyscrapers in the City of Boston, Massachusetts. While there are cities that have taller buildings than Boston, dangling over the side of even a six story building with nothing to stop our fall but a hard concrete sidewalk, which can intimidate even someone who has no fear of heights.

I do have a fear that others would laugh at because it is so irrational. I’m a self-avowed roller coaster enthusiast: the taller, faster, the more loop-de-loops, corkscrews, and plunges a coaster has, the better I like it. However, there is something that freaks me out more than anything--I cannot go backward unless I am able to see where I am going. The speed doesn’t matter. Here in Arlington, Texas, we would go to “Six Flags Over Texas” when I was growing up. I would ride everything there was to ride, except for one. People would ride this ride to take a break from the excitement of the more thrilling rides. Even grandparents would ride this potential death trap. The ride itself was in the form of a giant sailing ship, and it had benches that stretched from one side to the other. It would simply swing slowly back and forth, but I didn’t know this the first time my family and I got on. We sat at one of the ends when it was going backward, and this freaked me out. Because I was 6 or 7 years old, I let everyone in the park that day know that I was scared. I raised such a ruckus that the operator actually stopped the ride and not only gave me the opportunity to disembark but insisted that I did.

I know that’s an irrational and silly fear, and I should have taken an opportunity to face that fear and overcome it. While I never faced the fear of going backward, I am proud to say that I have faced another dear. All my life I have been called a student. I was told that I would never be anything but a “D” or “C” student. I was told that I would never amount to anything. I guess that part is true since I dropped out of high school in my junior year and have been in and out of prison since I was 19 years old. I have been doing a life sentence since 1995 and will call prison home for the rest of my life.

However, in January of this year, I decided to enroll in a couple of college courses here on the unit. I discovered something about myself: I am not stupid. Some courses are harder for me than others (thank God my math requirements are over), and some courses require more hours of study than others, but that is expected. I am currently in my third semester of college, and this semester, I am taking 9 semester hours. It is a lot of hard work and requires me to put aside other things that I like to do, but to me, it is well worth it.

I wish I had the courage to face all of my fears while I was still a free man, but that is not the way it unfolded in my life. I will never be able to get back those years that I listened to other people and allowed them to dictate what I did. Now I know, as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt so wisely said all those years ago, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself…”
