**Close Call by Jonathan E. Cantero**

I value order in my life. When I am subjected to chaos, my mind screams at me to leave the scene of the chaos or at least to demand that order be restored. But I cannot leave my assigned housing area, and I cannot change the chaotic nature of a disparate horde of disgruntled criminals. I live among these men, right in the midst of their madness, and I feel the same impotency, disillusionment, and frustration. It is only by the grace of God that I am not a raving lunatic leading the charge of mad men. It was a close call, but God had mercy on me.

Lord knows I was riding the tide of lunacy for many years. I didn’t care what the consequences of my actions would be. I had no concern for myself or for others. I just did whatever I felt like doing. After what I had already done, what did it matter? What did anything matter? We, the castoffs, the forgotten, the purveyors of chaos, have no hope of changing our fate and stepping into line with a kind and gentle society. Conformity and surrender were the lures beckoning to my desire to divest myself of any responsibility - past, present, or future. It was a close call, but God gave me another choice which I readily latched onto with faith and an inexplicable hope.

Even the moment of my turning was a culmination of scattered events. Another close call. I was moping around in the dorm, having just ran out of coffee and cigarettes, when a friend asked me to join him at a table where he and his friends were praying. All I had to do was say, “No.” I was jonesing and they certainly didn’t have what I was looking for. It would have been perfectly normal for me to ignore him and go on my way. But I didn’t. I sat down at that table and prayed. And for some reason everything in my life, all I had ever done, thought, or desired culminated in that prayer. Faith and hope entered my reality, providing an intangible substance to the order I’d always craved. I look back now and see how close I was to ignoring my friend who was instrumental in the most life-changing event I had ever experienced.

**Psych Camp 101**

On the walk to chow, chapel or work

In line with the crowd within the yellow lines

Far to the right of the road--

I try to shield myself from contact with anyone either physical or visual that may trigger a relapse in them

Into a psychosis that demands my distraction.

Here - every encounter skirts the edge of disaster

Since the manias of most of these men

Is largely undocumented.

Who knows how close I’ve come to being

Perceived as a demon as the scourge of the earth

And summarily attacked? (many more than one.)

This is my day, night, and morning:

Vigilantly staying apart from the crowd

And wondering how close I’ve come to a fearsome end.
