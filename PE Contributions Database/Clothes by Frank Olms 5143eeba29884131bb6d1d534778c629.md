**Clothes by Frank Olms**

There is an aphorism that infers: clothes makes the man, and there is another that states: dress for success. Two written statements that have absolutely no application to my current statue in life.

In my previous life as a self-employed entrepreneur, dress did have a slight impact on whether a potential customer would let me work for them. Some people are more impressed by the outward appearance of a man, rather than the integrity of the man himself or his qualification at his advertised profession.

In my current status in prison, clothes still make the man. Unfortunately, the clothes I am currently wearing distinguish me as a guest of a gated community, an inmate, so to speak-- a guest of the state! In prison? Maybe. But prison may be geographical for some and psychological for others and still others may find it simply a pit-stop in life’s cycle of things- a chance to regroup, restart.

Prison is, for me, just a different location from which I can still function in my new profession as a writer, an inditer of music or composition, of prose or poetry, of fact or fiction, of history or future events… ah, future events- speculation, prophecy, a wild guess as to what will or may happen, or may not happen… Will I still need clothes in the future, or, as an Inditer, will I only need pen and paper? Or maybe a paper suit?

I wonder if paper suits come in a rainbow of colors or if I will only clothe my mind with letters, numbers, and characters of various meanings-- ampersand forever!... but no clothes.
