**“My Sisters” by D. Gresham**

This is to all my sisters, living the struggle. I love you all. We are called Girly, Babies, Boys, Gay, Queer, Gender Nonconforming, Lesbians, trans, Intersex, Boogers, Dragons, and many other names. But sisters, in reality, we are just women who are misunderstood. People hate and fear what they don’t understand, and well sisters, it’s no military secret that men will never understand us. As women, we are the only puzzle that men will never completely decipher. So I’d like to give a round of applause to all the women in the world. No matter what society labels you, please remember that what truly matters is what’s embedded in our hearts. Stay strong sisters. Everything we go through only makes us stronger. By the looks of the way things are going, women will soon control the world. So keep your heads up. I love all of you and wish you all stay blessed and stay safe. Girl power!!
