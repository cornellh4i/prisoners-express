**“Finding Inspiration” by Thomas J. Combs**

At the entrance to the park I used to always frequent, is a beautiful sculpture known as ‘Woman Weeping.’

I’m not well traveled, but I’ve never seen anything like it -- I’ve never seen anyone cry the way she’s doing. She’s on her knees, succumbing to it completely, weighted down with suffering and grief. Her hands hide her face, her long hair has fallen forward and her shoulders are hunched in hopeless despair. It’s heartening and inspiring that an artist has got to grips with the anguish we all feel. Our sorrow about life itself and the torment of existence, braving each of its seconds and minutes, tolerating the gaze of others. There are plenty of other wonderful sculptures. Beautiful women with outstretched arms; athletic men; chubby, laughing children.

But give me the wonderful, inspiring, awe stricken, ‘weeping woman.’

She’s cast from gilded bronze, which has a lovely luster. When the sun streams through the branches of the trees above, she turns warm and golden like an ember. In winter, her body is as cold as ice with its round shoulders and narrow back, through which vertebrae protrude like marbles beneath the skin. Constantly and forever showing her slender body contorted in the throes of agony yet encompassed by her long legs and slim ankles as she kneels helplessly, beggingly, asking for mercy.
