**“Thankful” by Sincere Ogunda El**

I am thankful for many reasons, like for not being the recidivist acts barc. I am thankful that even though I missed the majority of my son’s life, he does not resent me as a father. He still loves me and can’t wait until I am back home so that we can go to the park. I am super thankful for my fiancé, who is the mother of my son, for still standing by my side even though in reality, she has plenty of reasons to desert me. She loves me because even though I am incarcerated and physically removed, I still manifest true love towards her and our son. She can feel the changes I am making towards not being a slave of the system. She knows that my heart is pure and my intentions are good. She sees the man that I am becoming. When I was sixteen years old, I was working at Taco Bell and messing up orders. She knew that it would take some time for me to grow into the man that she had seen, deep down in my core. That is why I am so thankful that she stayed close, because her love is a strong motivating force. I can never say thank you enough for her never abandoning me in my greatest time of need. Through the power of her love, I will succeed. I am thankful.
