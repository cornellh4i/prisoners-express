**“Knowledge Born Absolute God” by Raymond Springs**

On my vision quest under ruby red skies undivided from red adobe mountains and miles and miles of red sand, my spiritual journey began in the Arizona Desert and was induced by a gel capsule of LSD. My conscience cannot focus on the separation of sky and earth. It is at once clear; they are one. My senses are flooded with mighty endorphin and intense heat. Third eye active, I strip down to nature's beautiful form. My toes sing magical songs of joy because of the quench desire of unity with raw earth in her supreme nakedness sliding lightly through my dark Indian clay dirt toes, and I walk toward the wind speaking some ancient name.

Wind whispers the name in ears of divine, understanding and translating all language to the one original language which is completely understood by all of creation and existence in the eight realms of supreme reality. The name enchants my mind, the name so ancient and pure… IxChel… I am IxChel… the wind wings the name as a chant… my heart beats like drums but underneath my feet… that name repeated… IxChel… IxChel… over a million times as I walk in ecstasy in humanities red cave… IxChel is said at this sacred red down… when I say IxChel with mortal lips she appears sitting in the distance out of thin air she appears, my worlds are her flesh… I’m startled.

As I approach unashamed, she covers her mortal eye with her hand of eternity. Leaving exposed only the spiritual eye, she called the mirror of the soul. Now she sees all and is all knowing truth. ‘I am God’s reflections.” She smiles in spirit seen with third eye intelligence. She speaks not from mortal lips but from eternal lip of the winds saying “I am IxChel goddess of rainbow which I carry in the great jug of immortality. I am mistress of the sky goddess of the heavens. I am alive in you and also in all of all. I have come because you have found self and now have woke up in eternity. I am the goddess responsible for weaving time and space as one, presenting this illusional world of dreams. I am in the mind of God supreme as all of you is in absolute truth. Know that God is one and in God we all exist, but outside of God supreme, there is nothing.”

“IxChel, absolute, eternal, knowledge we are one being in God supreme call word, there is nothing else. Now you are power!... I disappeared and united all, and all is one. The only one is you, the reader! Giving life to this story, you are God supreme!”
