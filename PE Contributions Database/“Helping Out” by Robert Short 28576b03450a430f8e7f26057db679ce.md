**“Helping Out” by Robert Short**

To say I had a difficult childhood is a bit of an understatement. I know some had it worse, but it was tough. You see, my mom was raising five kids almost by herself. She worked an armed security job that was barely above minimum wage. It was hard on all of us. I was the second oldest and had plenty of issues, but that’s another story. This one is about my mom’s sister and her husband, my Aunt Jane and Uncle Bob. She ran the printing office for the local health department, which from a young age we were almost too educated about things like O.D. and drug abuse and my Uncle Bob was a deputy sheriff. The only time that was a negative was the first time I went to adult jail at 18. His best friend was the largest jailor our sheriff's department had. And, after I got processed, he yanked me outta the tank and made sure I was alright. Then, he gave me a pack of smokes and put me in. Needless to say, some were very leery of me. Anyhow, this is about them. Had it not been for them helping look out for us, we would have not had any real holiday or birthday celebrations. They always made sure that we had presents at Christmas, turkey and fixin’s at Thanksgiving, and birthday candles to blow out. And, even when I did get arrested, my aunt Jane got me bonded out without hesitation. It was this love and compassion in my youth that allowed me to keep it together when the son of my favorite ex-girlfriend’s stole a hundred dollar bill out of my wallet and forgave him and let him work it off in chores around the house. I will always remember we lead by example and love is stronger than hate.
