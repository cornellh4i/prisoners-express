**by Sarah Julie Spencer**

In my lifetime, I’ve had at least 5 different styles of hair and at least 5 different lengths. I’m currently sporting a Faux-Hawk (or “fake mohawk”), and I like mohawks thick, thin, long, short, layered, and glued to a stick landing at 90 degrees to the person’s head.

The youngest photo I have of myself is at 6 months. At that time, my hair resembled an extremely short and thin Afro. The little hair I had was wispy and sparse and curled into my tiny lockets. I quickly outgrew this look, and by the time I was two, my aunt cut my hair into a chin length, more-or-less straight pixie, which was highlighted blonde from the scalp out to about 2 inches. The rest of my hair was light ashy brown. After that season of my life, I grew my hair to my knees, which wasn’t that long since I was under 3 feet tall at 4 years old. While my hair was a mixture of blonde and ashy brown, my hair grew in thick yet soft like cat’s fur.

Just before I went to school, my blonde waves were cut into a short, dark pixie cut which exposed parts of my ears and my entire face. My first set of teeth were straight and even, and when I smiled, I was one of the hottest first graders around. In second grade, however, my two front teeth fell out, and my hair was sun-bleached and my face was sunburned most of the time.

Then, my hair looked like a dull moose-brown in 3rd grade because I got my tonsils removed. However, by 4th grade, my hair fused into a reddish-blondish brown and developed curly waves.

Fifth grade was an enigma in which I suddenly became a tom-boy who was boy-crazy all the time. I wore my hair short and thinned out, much like Mo and Larry of “The Three Stooges.” In the 6th grade, my hair grew down past my shoulders, and I started to wash it with an egg early in the morning before my parents got up. The egg straightened my now wavy and frizzy hair, but did not get rid of the frizz. Static electricity would make it stand up on end at the very top, and while experimenting with electricity in this way, I created a unique look for sixth grade.

For 7th through 9th grade, my thin belly and legs drew attention from boys more than my hair did, and so I wore it just whatever way. However, in 10th grade, I cut my hair into a long shag. By 11th, I got a perm which looked like a ball of fire. It was dry, and as it grew, I picked it into the largest orange ball you’d ever seen atop anyone’s head! This brightened my outlook immensely after my family relocated 3000 miles, and I missed my old friends. In 12th grade, I went back to my 4th grade look, but sometimes my hair was reddish.

I never officially colored my hair or even plucked my eyebrows until I was in my mid-twenties. Finally trying marked the beginning of my Gothic phase. At first, everything was black, even my eyebrows and lipstick, and my hair was cut very close to my head. I then tried herbal colorants, and those were various shades of red, blonde, and even burgundy. In fact, for nearly two decades, I colored my hair so many times, I had forgotten the true color of my hair!
