**“The Patio” by Robert Bartlett**

Juan was not a greedy man. He cultivated his fields, planted his seeds, harvested his crops, and gave fifty percent to his landlord and ten percent to his church. Most years, he had enough left to pay the utility bills and feed and clothe his family well. In a really good year, he went to the bank in a town about ten miles away and deposited six hundred U.S. dollars into his child’s college fund. In a bad year, he had to withdraw some of it.

There was a penalty for early withdrawal.

A few years ago, his next door neighbor got into a little difficulty with a cartel. Juan purchased his farm at a distress price. The house wasn’t as nice as his, but he moved anyway. It was cramped and crowded for a family of three, but it was his, free and clear.

Juan made arrangements through a friend in the United States of America to rent his old house to rich gringos. The landlord didn’t mind, as long as he got his fifty percent; but he wouldn’t contribute anything to the cost of fixing it up.

Juan resisted the temptation to install central air conditioning in his new house. The new rooms he added didn’t even have electricity the first year, but with a few walls made of used brick and a little help from some of his friends from church, he enclosed a large area of what had been a brown lawn. He tore up the surviving grass and weeds, and laid down a beautiful tile floor. Those patio tiles were the only building material he bought new and paid full price for.

His wife was furious when he told her he had no money left for furniture. He did manage to set up a huge hammock.

She must have forgiven him. They had a daughter nine months later.

This past summer, Juan told her he had enough money for some nice furniture for the house or a small air conditioning system. She told him to set up another college fund and not to worry about furniture or air conditioning. He lay down beside her and the baby, and they talked for hours about their dreams for the future.
