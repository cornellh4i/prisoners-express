**Clothes by Yankee Lawyer**

Clothes are portable shelters we carry with us as a snail carries his shell of a hermit crab carries a shell cast off by another creature. They protect us from hot or cold air, inclement weather, fire, sharp tools and other hazards. We often wear clothes that serve no such purpose.

Men wear fine clothes to show social, economic and military status. Women wear fancy dresses and jewelry to attract men. In some tropical areas, it’s a disgrace for an adolescent or adult male to be seen in public without a penis guard.

Prior to my arrest, I wore cotton, wool and leather over silk underwear. For a year, I wore an orange jumpsuit. Underwear was a luxury. For nineteen years, I wore a brown uniform. Now my clothes are green. I’m still the same person underneath though, a child of God who doesn’t believe that grown-ups should be allowed to exploit children for sex or money.

In prison, where most of the population is homosexual or bisexual, punks wear pants that are one, two or even three sizes larger than the ones properly issued to them. Horny boys often comment about my “tight” pants, which I wear slightly below my waist. Fine! Let them criticize. My anus and buttocks are not for hire at any price.

Each of us is admonished by God not to be a “respecter of persons.” We are to love our neighbor whether he dresses in new Gucci and Armani clothes or not.

The Old Testament associates expensive clothes with sin, iniquity, pride and hypocrisy. Even in the first century in Palestine, where the Greek gymnasium was a controversial and volatile subject, a farm laborer or gardener on a warm sunny day was expected to be naked. The Lord Himself got up from the table, took off his clothes, and washed the apostles’ feet.

The funniest story in the Bible is about some high-ranking Isrealites who ran into trouble among their heathen neighbors. They sent word to the king that the enemy had shaved their beards and cut the hems off their garments. They were told to stay where they were until their beards grew back. The exposure of their private parts was regarded as a trivial matter, not worthy of further discussion.

Adam and Eve made the first clothes right after they betrayed their creator. Their fig leaf garments were like the grass skirts popularized by Hawa’iian missionaries. Imagine the agony in Heaven when God killed some of his beloved creatures, skinned them, and covered Adam and Eve with their blood!

The world has never been the same.
