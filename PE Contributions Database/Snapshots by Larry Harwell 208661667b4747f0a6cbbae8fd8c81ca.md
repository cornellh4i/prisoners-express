**Snapshots by Larry Harwell**

In my mother’s obituary were two pictures of her. One, a 16 year old tall redhead East Texas beauty. The second, a 92 year old well lived visage. Two pictures we are presented with, and had I not known her, I would be left to judge her by those two pictures, and they do not tell her story. If her life was a motion picture, lasting about 92 years old and I watched the whole thing, I may have some understanding, but still limited for I may not know her heart.

Last night, a friend and I were enjoying a pocket together and he was complaining about so and so, and what an ego trip they were on. I mentioned that I myself have a difficult time with my own ego concerning myself with. Someone else’s ego is beyond my capabilities. There was silence at our table for a while.

So it spurred me to think about the snapshots we take of people and then judge them on the picture we see, however incomplete. Is that honest? Aren’t we leaving out the entire movie that has thus far played in their life? We may not be interested in their movie, but does it serve us or them to pass judgement on the small scene we see, which by the way may be clouded by our own bias and limited knowledge?
