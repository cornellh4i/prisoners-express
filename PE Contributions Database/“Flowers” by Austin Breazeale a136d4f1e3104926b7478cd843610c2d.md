**“Flowers” by Austin Breazeale**

When I think of a flower, I think of the daughter I want to have. I want to watch her grow into a beautiful woman. Just like a flower. She grows into something beautiful. The flower starts out small then grows. Only problem with the flower is that you can’t be there to protect it. Unless you grow it yourself. Then you will want to make sure nobody destroys it’s beauty. Just like my daughter.

Or the flower could represent a wife. Not only is it so beautiful, but it is sacred to you. It’s delicate and means a lot to you. And as the flower gets older it starts to wilt and fade away, but it’s still so important to you. You wouldn’t want anything to harm her.

There’s a lot you could compare to this. But I like the daughter/woman comparison. I think it fits better than anything else.
