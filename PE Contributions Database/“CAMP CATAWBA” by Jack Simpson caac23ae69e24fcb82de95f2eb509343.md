“CAMP CATAWBA” by Jack Simpson

This is a life of adventure for me. I have never been away from home before. Camp Catawba is to teach young children the ways of the Native Americans.

The bus was filled with boys and girls from the ages of eight to thirteen. It would be a four day retreat. Barbara and I had just met on the bus. We both had agreed to share the same sleeping area. The old bus was yellow and had been used for a very long time. It had been painted a light green in other parts.

The Native American we met at the front entrance seemed friendly. When we stepped off the bus a young boy about the age of ten pointed to us both and motioned for us to follow. The three of us ended up at a small cabin. Inside was a set of bunk beds. I took the top while Barbara took the bottom. I didn’t mind, I like being able to see the ceiling. I did notice she had a slight limp. When she stood, she pulled with all her strength. Her left leg looked normal to me, but her right had an odd color.

That night at bedtime, she gave her secret away. On the floor lay her right leg. The best I could tell. It had been removed six inches below the knee. I went back to bed. We both slept until we were woken by a PA system. It was telling us that breakfast will be served in the main cafeteria. Everyone was to be on time.

Barbara called out before heading for the door. “I’ll race you for your juice.” My shoe just wouldn’t fit right. Now this was going to take a minute. The laces had been pulled extra tight almost to the top. The thought flashed through my mind: it was Barbara.

I wasn’t upset with her. I was upset with myself for not thinking of it first.

The line that led inside the cafeteria wasn’t long. I saw Barbara waving and smiling. I could only grin. After all she won the bet. My name was called out loud. Carla! Carla, come join us. We have plenty of room. I knew this girl well. It was Pamela Porter. The most annoying girl in our school. Once she started to talk you couldn’t get a word in edgewise. “Later”, I told her as I passed by and headed to sit with Barbara.

“Hope you like your juice fresh. Thank you for taking your time and letting me win,” she said with a grin, taking another bite of her toast. I too had a few things I could battle with. But it could wait till later.

Barbara told me she had four older brothers who would try to get to the table first. I had to learn to get them before they did anything to me. That way my food would still be hot. “I know you were wondering about my leg,” she said. “The doctors removed it because it didn’t work properly. Once I am fully grown, they will fit me with one that works. You can see I can get around very well.” Then she did that funny smile.

“All right boys and girls, we have a full day planned for all of you,” said the PA. “Canoe rides, swimming, archery, flute making, and how to catch fish.” Then the PA went dead.

Barbara and I both agreed to learn how to make a flute. Once we both had put the finishing touches on it, our instructor took our flutes and graded them. During the sounds each produced, he carved our names on the side. Then he handed them back to us. Not only was he delighted in the work we had done, we all were given Indian names.

The day we were to leave, I talked with Barbara. We hugged and agreed to exchange our flutes.

Once in a while I still think of Barbara and how twenty years changed my life. I close my eyes and produce a soft note. Remembering back to Camp Catawba and my friend with the artificial leg. With hopes that she would be playing my flute at the same time I’m playing hers.
