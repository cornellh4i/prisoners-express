The town I grew up in was hardly a “big” city. In fact, it was nothing more than a small coastal town nestled along the shores of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. However, there was a big city that I discovered at a young age that was less than an hour away. For me, the big city of Boston was a magical and mysterious place, filled with excitement and wonder.

My brother and I were frequent airline travelers as we had lots of relatives in North Carolina, and, perhaps, one of my fondest memories is of roaming the many places of Logan International Airport back in the 80s, of course, when a kid could still get away with it. We found ourselves circling the tables of the various airport restaurants waiting for the people sitting at them to get up and leave. We grew quite impatient at times. “Why?” you ask. Well, that’s the most humorous of my memories. My brother and I simply couldn’t believe how so many grown-ups could forget they’d left money on their tables! Needless to say, my brother and I always had a little extra money to spend down in the land of Dixie. Compliments of Logan Airport and what I’ve been calling “The Great City of Beantown” for a long time.

Of course, there were lots of other awesome times in the big city too, like the field trips to the New England Aquarium, the Boston Museum of Science, and Beacon Hill. No matter what mode of transportation I used to get to the big city-- car, boat, train, or the “T” (subway)-- I was never disappointed.

Today, my son and daughter, both who now live in North Carolina, enjoy summer visits up to the Cape, but at sixteen and twenty-one they always seem to find time for an ol’ visit to the big city, Quincy Market being one of their favorites.

As for finding people’s tips left on airport tables, well, they leave that adventure to their dear old dad and Uncle Mike!
