**How it feels by Akai Thuang McRee Tran**

Well...Life can give and take as things can move with you or without you. But, you can not live in a box, live free as a bird or just be yourself to all that changes and fall’s around you…

Life is a two-way street and you are the only one that can make it without losing yourself. As many may talk but so few speak as one may hear, but who truly listens to the lost?

As the dead lie in its place, so the memories of none with painless reaction to the void…As a new world becomes empty…

As this new world is filled with so much emptiness, only the fading footsteps are the only mark’s that show where you have been or who is coming to the end of a line that never was…This is what this hollow shell of a so-called human feel’s like…

As it is easier to close your eyes than to really open them to see what is going on!
