**“Who’s There?” by Jack Simpson**

I grew up afraid of the dark. There really is no reason I should be like that. What I can’t see with my eyes scare me.

My family didn’t stay in one town too long, the most I can remember was seven years. I don’t blame my parents for all the moves when you work for a company like my father. The job keeps a person moving.

The house we moved to was so big. I finally had my own room. That had been my dream all along. To be able to sit and study, read without anyone running into the room.

As a new kid at school, it has always been a challenge to me. A lot of other kids don’t like the “new girl.” People are so rude staring at you while trying to figure you out.

In the cafeteria I always sat alone. Today would be a little different. A tall, but slender black haired girl walked up to my table. “Hi,” she said, “can I sit here?” she asked with a smile. “My name is Wendy.” I was a little hesitant to give her my name.

“My name is Pam, Pam Baxten.” We talked until it was time to return class.

The walk to my house from the school was no more than three blocks. I heard my name being called. It was Wendy again. “Wait up” she cried out.

Wendy told me of a party this upcoming Saturday night. It is only for girls. No boys allowed, no alcohol, and it will give you a chance to meet the rest of the girls. I told her I would have to check with my parents, and that we would talk at school the next day.

Friday at school I got the address and told her I would be there by 5pm. My parents told me that I had to be home by midnight. I agreed to their terms. I would leave early from the party to be sure that I would be home on time.

When I arrived, Wendy was right. It was all girls. I saw no alcohol. All was going well. We talked and I got to know all of the girls there. For some reason they all wanted to walk the town. It was total darkness outside. Only a few street lights brightened the sidewalk.

Then one of my fears was in front of me. The town cemetery was in front of me. I froze in place, “Okay, c’mon on Pam. This is nothing to be afraid of. Everyone here is asleep. I knew better. They were dead. There isn’t anyone here going to haunt you.”

“Alright,” I said. Let’s go and see what happens. Wendy finally shut up and we all went through the gate. I did see a few fresh graves and new flowers.

“Wait right here Pam,”Wendy said. “I will be right back.”

“Where are you going?” I asked.

“Don’t worry or move. I’ll be back soon.”

Good thing I had my watch. I looked and it was 8pm. It seemed like hours passed and Wendy wasn’t back. Two hours had passed and still no one. It was time for me to do something.

I heard all kinds of noises, still I didn’t see anyone. My feet began to move on their own. As fast as I could go. I was heading for the entrance. A rustling sound came from close to me. I still couldn’t see anything. “Who’s there?” I cried out. No one answered back. I was really lost and confused.

My watch showed me 10:30pm. I knew if I wasn’t home before midnight I would be grounded for who knows how long. Another sound caused my feet to take off. “Who’s there?” I cried out. Still nothing. I had to be close to the entrance. I had a feeling deep down and I panicked. Why me of all people? Did they do this to all the new girls?

I had just ten minutes to make it home. When I reached for the doorknob, my mother greeted me and said “you only made it by one minute.”

The following week at school I saw the looks the girls gave me. We talked and I didn’t let on I had been pranked.

I invited them all over for a slumber party. They all agreed to it, and my parents would be gone overnight.

When they all arrived we set up in my room. The theme was Ghost Stories. Soon the stories were told. Some I had heard before, and a few were new to me.

With one candle burning everyone sat quietly. I closed my eyes, and said “Spirits of this house reveal yourself to us.” It was really quiet in the house. Then a creaking sound could be heard. There was no one in the house except us.

Wendy had to relieve herself - too many sodas. “Wendy” I called out. She didn’t answer.

Then we heard footsteps, and her voice cried out “Who’s there?!” As the light from the candle hit her face. It was priceless, the blank stare, she had met something or someone. Did she encounter the spirit of the house? Or was it inside her alone?

Next time you enter a dark room, you might ask yourself “Who’s there?”
