**“Flying” by Corey Higgins**

****Flying is an action or process of flight, and the meaning of flying to me has to deal with my life within prison. I’m going to start by saying a lot of people wish their time could just “fly by.” But what most don’t think about is the world outside flying by and before you know it we end up lost in time or we get out and don’t know where to start or how to even fill out for a job or use a computer, new phones, and of course everything is now touch screen. So we end up lost in a world that’s “flying by” us!

Though at times I use the word as I’m climbing up to the sky and flying within my art and studies which in the long run hope to better myself and take flight in my life and fly to the top in my life. Flying in my goals of life takes an art to keep in the air to show in my studies and to change my flaws.

So once I’ve mastered the flying in my life I’ll be above all my troubles and flaws within. To fly out of the prison am in, to fly above issues around me to envision a better life, a life in the sky and me flying.
