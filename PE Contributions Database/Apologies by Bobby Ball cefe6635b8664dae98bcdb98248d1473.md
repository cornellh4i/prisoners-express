**“Apologies” by Mr. Bobby Ball**

The Tip of the Blade Piercing the Heart

Life is Temporary with no control over the choice.

Memories of Mother Nature Madness Massaging the mind

Balancing Compassion between the dark and the Light

If everything happens For a Reason, History Repeats itself…

Fire a Flame in the sky Looking For a Way out of this Maze

The Capacity of Tragedies Suffocating th Youth

Father Time on Vacation now the Babysitter is Death

When it Rains and the sun shine the Devil beating his Wife

Where will the Ladybug Land the perfect place and Time.

**“Apologies” by Mr. Bobby Ball**

Why is Life Temporary Reality Rushes Rage

Bound by time, Untimely Matters prohibits prestige

Possessiveness defined as a sin

As the world Turns, Pleasure and Pain

PHOTOGRAPHS PEOPLE PLACES & THINGS

Tested by Temptations

Transform thoughts to tackle toughness

Tomorrows Triumphs
