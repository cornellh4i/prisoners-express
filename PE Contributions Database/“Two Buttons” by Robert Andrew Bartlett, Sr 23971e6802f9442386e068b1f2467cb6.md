**“Two Buttons” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

****The tent was dark, damp, and much too small for two grown men. The waning moon was high in the sky, but the tiny sliver gave little light even when the clouds parted in front of it. Tomorrow, the team would strike undercover in total darkness. Tonight, they were supposed to be getting extra sleep, but sleep wouldn’t come.

“Well, Abdul. This time tomorrow you might be curled up with 20 virgins,” one of them said after a slight pause.

“It’s not such a big deal, Andy. I’ve been with a few virgins in this life and a few more experienced women. They’re all about the same,” Abdul replied. A second later, he added, “They’re all better than your Christian sluts.”

He couldn’t see them, but he knew Andy was rolling his eyes.

“It’s time Christian women got no morals and no character.”

Andy didn’t share Abdul’s lofty opinion of Muslim women, but this was not the time to get drawn into a fight with his buddy. “I just wish the Donald had kept his fingers off that fucking button.” He rolled over and tried to go to sleep, but sleep wouldn’t come.

The battle was to last five hours (Andy and Abdul never believed that). Dawn came and went. Three times.

Though the tent wasn’t enough for the two, they were grateful for it. Most of the unit were sleeping under the stars. Six men occupied a small abandoned farmhouse, and briefly after settling in, the Shiites bombed it. All were presumed dead, even Bob whose screams and moans died out after about four hours.

“Did you hear that?” Andrew asked. Abdul peered through the flaps. The waxing moon casted dark shadows over an increasingly barren landscape. A small boy was throwing up. Abdul closed the flaps and turned on his lantern. “Grab your gas mask” he coughed. His eyes were watering, and his nose was running. Andrew wasn’t sure if the issuing fluid was mucus or blood.

Seventeen men and one boy about 9 years old made it to the roof of the tallest building still standing in the area. The boy was wearing Abdul’s mask. He would probably have a nasty cough for the rest of his life, but he had survived. Abdul’s eyes were glazed, and his skin was cyanotic. The issue of his nose was definitely blood.

They all survived the night. Around dawn, Andrew noticed two signs, one promising and the other portentous. The boy was staring toward the east as two dots appeared ever larger and darker over the horizon, and they seemed the source of a faint sound like that of helicopters. The other significant sensation was an acrid smoke like that of a burning building. That smell was everywhere in a city that had been under siege for four days, but it was strong and increasing. When he saw the first dark wings emerge from the stairwell, Andrew already concluded that the group would not be able to wait in their small rooftop sanctuary and be rescued.

It was the boy who devised their escape plan. The descent to street level was slow and arduous and with numerous detours due to fire, flame, or prior structural damage. Andrew carried Abdul, and the boy led them and fourteen others (one fell on the last flight of stairs and didn’t get up) to a small school playground where there was ample room for a signal fire and two helicopters.

The rescue took two trips. Abdul, the boy, and eight others went in the first flight. Andrew and five other men (one had been killed by a brief burst of gunfire, source unknown) went out an hour later.

Andrew visited Abdul in the field hospital two days later. His friend couldn’t talk much. His throat was still raw, and scar tissue was forming on his vocal cords. Andrew updated him on the status of the war. He was hopeful that it might be over within 3 or 4 years.

“The British have retaken the Golan Heights, and a report from Wikileaks says the Caliph is dead.” Abdul shook his head but said nothing. “Some Israeli troops just stormed the last known ISIS stronghold a few clicks east of here, with just a couple of dozen casualties. THey didn’t lose a single man. Seventeen wounded are in the next tent. Most of them will be going home tomorrow.”

Abdul looked at his watch. “The boy?” he asked in a throaty whisper.

“He’s behind one of those curtains. They’ll probably discharge him tomorrow.” Andrew thought Abdul would be as pleased as he was, but Abdul looked upset and agitated.

“Today,” he rasped. “Now!” He was fingering a button on his watch.

“Relax,” Andrew said, trying to comfort his friend without knowing why he was so upset. “We finally located his family. His parents are dead, but an older brother should be here in the morning.”

A small tear trickled down Abdul’s cheek. “Too late,” he said. Then he was silent, but Andy saw his lips moving in a silent prayer. Andy didn’t know when his friend last washed his hands. “Do you need some water?”

Abdul shook his head. “Too late.” He pushed the button on his watch and loud enough to be heard easily despite the painful effort, said, “Allahu akbar!” Then there was a loud explosion.
