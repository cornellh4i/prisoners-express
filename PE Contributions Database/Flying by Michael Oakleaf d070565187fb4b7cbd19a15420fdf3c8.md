**Flying by Michael Oakleaf**

I was seventeen the first time I set foot on an airplane. It was the very end of March 1988, the week of Easter, and I was one of a group of students from my high school going to Europe. We flew overnight from Washington, D.C. to London, England. The jet was massive, and was very comfortable with large seats. I was both excited and terrified to fly, and the plane had very few passengers. The flight was smooth, and we were treated to a glimpse of the aurora borealis over Iceland. The flight home almost two weeks later was very different. In contrast, we flew from Madrid, Spain, to New York City during the day. The plane was still large, but a lot smaller than our first. The seats were smaller, cramped, and the flight had been overbooked. During the flight, we hit heavy turbulence for most of the trip, and had to remain seatbelted most of the time. From New York back to Washington, D.C., we had a comparatively shorter flight, maybe one and one-half hours, aboard a plane with a single aisle between its seats. This leg of the trip was so short and uneventful, I really have little memory of it. At the end of this adventure, I had almost fifteen hours of flying experience, and I was hooked. I could not wait for my next opportunity to fly.

Since then, I have flown many times, including aboard a flight from Phoenix, AZ, to Washington, D.C., on January 15 1991, which was the deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait before Operation Desert Storm. Security at airports was incredibly high. Armed police and police with dogs were very visible. I have also flown in a single engine prop plane over the Grand Canyon a couple of times. However, my strangest memory related to flying was in the days following September 11, 2001, and I was not even on an airplane. I was living in the northwestern part of Arizona right under a flight path going into Vegas. In addition, we frequently (daily) saw military jets from Nellus Air Force Base, also in Las Vegas. After the attacks on the east coast, it was strange to look up in the sky, and not see the lines of aircraft; it was a very noticeable and shocking difference.
