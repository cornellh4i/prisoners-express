**“Weddings” by Cesar Hernandez**

Weddings are a lot more work than deciding to get married in the first place. My brother met his wife in three chance encounters. His friend dragged him to a baseball game. His wife got dragged to the same game by her friend. All four were seated next to each other. My brother met his wife there and talked a little with his now wife. A week later he’s at the train station. She is there. She is going South and he’s going North. They see each other and exchange numbers. A week later he’s on a flight and it is so late he barely got on the plane. He sits down and she is next to him. They have about a four hour conversation and hit it off. About six months later they get engaged.

Now comes the wedding planning. She didn’t think the dress would be too hard to find. After all, every wedding dress boutique has hundreds of dresses. After four stores and a hundred dresses or so, she still can’t find a dress she likes. My brother hasn’t even started to look for a tuxedo. She tells him it’s not as fast as he thinks. He finally agrees to look for a tux. On Saturday they both go to a tuxedo shop. He tries on one Roberto Cavalli tuxedo and buys it. It was less than fifteen minutes from when they walked in the shop until he walked out. That only ends up enraging her more since she still can’t find a dress she likes. After she tries on probably another one hundred dresses she is at her wit’s end. Finally she decides to go to Barney’s. She finds the perfect white Valentino dress. She tries it on and it is perfect. She almost has a heart attack when she sees the price tag of ten thousand dollars. She loves the dress but ten thousand dollars seems excessive. She calls my brother. She tells him she found the perfect dress and asks what her price limit is. He tells her seven thousand. She says perfect, it’s sixty eight hundred. She puts the dress on two credit cards. Sixty eight hundred on my brother’s American Express card and the rest on her Visa card. She feels guilty about the ten thousand dollar dress so she insists on a simple wedding reception. They get married at a small winery. From time to time she still wears the Valentino dress which looks very good on her.
