**“‘E-Way’ or ‘Toon Wild’?” by Tracey Hamilton**

****My nickname is the first thing a guy judges me off of. When men in Michigan hear me being called E-Way, the first thing they think is, “That guy is from the eastside of Detroit, Michigan.” I automatically have a standard of living and represent all the other men who are from where I’m from. I must act, talk, and do what “we” do in order to live up to those standards, or otherwise risk being scrutinized on every little thing. I used to be the violent, drug dealer thug who had no heart. The stigma people from the eastside endure. I want to be me and break from the mold, showing guys you don’t have to be fake or front to be loved by your homies. Since finding God, my life has slowly changed me bit by bit. I continue to evolve as a man all the time by help from resources such as Prisoner Express. Now instead of a stigma, I can be the funny, out-going, sometimes wild, crazy, caring, and loving individual called “Toon Wild.” In prison, we all have nicknames. I let guys choose to call me E-Way, Toon, or Tracey, depending on our level and type of friendship.
