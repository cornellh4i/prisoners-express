***Fear of Water* by Adam “Rook” Galbraith**

****We left Sweden 17 hours ago, and the smell of pomade and mint candies periodically overwhelm out of nowhere, as if we have never been around old folks before. After 3 days of palling around with the local Devil worshippers (Satan worship and the study of Anton LaVey constitute the 3rd largest faith in Sweden), my fiancee and I were nicely asked by her cordial cousins if we’d like to continue our travels. They prepared in advance for an extradition by purchasing fare on an old timers’ bus tour going to Berlin with stops in Moscow and St. Petersburg. I don’t remember how we made friends with the House of the Dark Lord, but they did know their vodka, and goodness gracious, they were friendly.

One of the antiques decided to sleep in an attempt to ignore his wife since she made it her goal on the trip to notice everything and that her life mate was aware that her mission was accomplished. His nap does not slow her aged hyperactivity, and she chose us nice punk kids from Chicago to be her new friends. She opened the dialogue by pointing out for us that our respective mohawks, colored pink and blue, set off each other very well, and that she wouldn’t have been able to tell if we were boys or girls without the color coding. I silently smiled and noded my head while I felt the heat radiating off of Sylvia’s face.

There are several Russian words that don’t have a direct English translation. One such word is “bezizkhodnost,” and the closest word to describe it is “exitlessness.” The love of my life once tried to stuff a broken beer bottle down the throat of a biker who was easily five times her weight. She was wearing the same expression on her face at that moment, and so I put a hand on her thigh in an attempt to distract her from the thoughts of blood lust she must have been having. I had a psychic moment and wondered if a legal union with a succubi would be a good idea. Not because I don’t believe that she’s the one for me, but rather because I fear the inevitable divorce. Her hatred for this woman and all things pouring out of her mouth maybe lost on everyone but me, but I also know that if she doesn’t cool it soon, her venom will be spilled on anyone it can find--which may be me first. I get the “You know better than to try and make me laugh right now” look, and I was glad that keeping her opinions to herself, she only snarled and flared.

Once our sojourn across Scandinavia ended, our norse chariot driver informed us over the PA system that we arrived in Russia. After an exaggerated groan of relief from my future bride, I thought that life would go back to normal once we arrived in the hotel.

We arrived in Putin Ville, and in the light rain, I stepped out and breathed in freedom and burned petrol. Someone on the bus made certain that we would not drink the water in Moscow, claiming that it contained bacteria that the locals were used to but would give us dysentery. I realized that I was standing alone but then quickly turned to find her standing on the steps of the bus. The toughest person I know reminded me that she’s still a girl, and so I took off my jacket and raised it for her to stand under as she cautiously steps off to make our way into the hotel.
