**"Practical Joke"** **by Shane Brewer**

It’s so easy to write about my life because of my family and somewhat friends. But when I was around nine or even eleven, we would watch the MTV show Jackass and do a lot of stupid stuff. One time, my stepdad was sleeping, and my brothers named Adam and David and I would shoot spitballs and paper hornets with a rubber band at him, and we egged his car and blamed it on a little clown the street.

Or when we popped his tyres and blamed it on the same kid. We order $200 of porn on our cable provider, man that was fun! But as I became older my joke got more devious and hurtful. I realize now that prank calling the suicide hotline, prank calling the police department, and pretending to kill myself to hear my girlfriend cry were bad. I realize it now that I’m older, but I still try to have fun now and then while I’m locked up. Getting a guy named New York to snort cum off a shower handle, drinking two litres of water, throwing ice on inmates while they are in the shower. Haha!

This is one of my personal favorites: getting four or five to scream and bang on the door screaming, “Get down! Don’t move or you will be tased!” It’s really funny at three or four in the morning. We paid for New York’s tattoo of a flower tramp stamp, and it’s so funny. His back is ruined badly. But some of the jokes might even go too far sometimes: throwing batteries, trying to hit other inmates, flooding the entire cell block, spraying people while they’re sleeping, putting Kool-Aid on someone’s butt and paying someone to lick it off. Nasty but funny. It’s all in good spirit, and it’s even funnier because it’s true!
