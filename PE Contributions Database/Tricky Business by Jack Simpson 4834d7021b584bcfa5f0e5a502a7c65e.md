**Tricky Business by Jack Simpson**

One thing in life I have learned to stay away from is politics. When a person that you have known for years gets involved in this area. They say in no-way will I let it change me.

I will say that for a person who lived in the same lifestyle as myself. Who loved the simple life and said nothing could change him. I found it not to be true. He and I are different as night and day.

One day I decided to call, and congratulate his victory. Not only did he seem to not know me, but I even went on to ask about how his wife and kids were. Really I wanted to get together like old times. That was when he informed me, “that person doesn't exist anymore.” We parted our ways, and it was a month before he reached out to me.

When I answered the phone. He tried his best to apologize for his past actions. His conversation was solid and intact. Not one of those who try to hide his very demeanor, he stood firm in what we talked about.

Politics are a tricky business. A lot of people find themselves too high on the totem pole. Just like the show The Jeffersons. What started out as a small person soon forgot the lower people and forget where they came from. Sooner or later in life the same person who forgets this will find themselves to fall from power.

We talked for about an hour, he even told me that the day I called. The person he had In his office was In the higher upper class. They were on the way out for lunch with a few other clients, and I thanked him for his concern, letting him know I wasn’t mad at him, that we could still get together. He also agreed to that.

I saw him a couple of times over the next three years. I’m glad that my mind had never been in that field. After seeing how shallow he looked; bags under his eyes. His hair had thinned and turned gray and he looked as if sleep was not his friend anymore. Worry lines had formed over his forehead. Even his face had wrinkles upon wrinkles.

There was something going on that had to be fixed. Not everyone will step in and help a friend in need. He was going down the drain like so many before. Not this fellow he was my friend. I was taught a friend Is for life even under the circumstances that change a persons way of thinking.

We both sat and talked in a cafe out of the way. That was when he told me the truth. His wife had started to spend money he didn’t have. The one thing that hurts the most was that she was seeing someone else and the late night phone calls.

All I could do was listen to him pour out his heart, I was his friend, and a lot cheaper than any “psychiatrist.” Some things in life hurt, and the human mind can deal with It. In his case he found out what a tricky business politics is for real.
