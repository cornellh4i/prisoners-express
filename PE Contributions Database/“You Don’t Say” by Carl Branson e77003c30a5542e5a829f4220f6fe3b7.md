**“You Don’t Say” by Carl Branson**

Actually, I do say! It has been over a half century since I graduated from high school- yeah, I’m that old. As a result, I can personally attest to many of the changes that have occurred recently in our society- most easily described being the change in value of our “money.”

Probably the most dramatic change that X-gen and millenial members will not, or at least find hard to, believe is that paper money with the words “silver certificate” and more rarely “gold certificate” were still in circulation during the mid 1960’s. Both of these types of paper money could be exchanged at certain banks on a one-for-one face value basis for silver or gold coins respectively. Today these precious metal coins are treated as numismatic commodities with a variable exchange rate between federal reserve paper dollars and United States mint coins of similar face value. (There is a debatable constitutional legal issue involved on this point which I avoid herein.)

Another example of the diminished value of our money is its purchasing power. In 1966(the year I got my first “real” job), the minimum wage was increased from $1.00 to $1.10 per hour. Now, we are seeing demonstrations demanding a minimum wage of $15.00 per hour rather than the current $10.00 per hour. In terms of buying power, gasoline was $0.15 per gallon versus the recently advertised $2.49 per gallon (down from its $4.00 plus range). On a minimum wage basis, it took 1.36 hours of work to purchase 10 gallons of gasoline versus 2.49 hours at the current $10 minimum.

The same kinds of comparisons can be made regarding food, clothing, housing, and other essentials. Granted, certain items(electronics in particular) require the same, or in some rare cases, fewer, number of worked minimum wage hours to make the purchase.

For every increase in minimum wage there is a proportionate increase in prices by manufacturers and service providers so as to maintain profit margins- and, to entice investors, profits must increase from year to year- when effectively defeats the perceived benefit of a minimum wage increase.

Other areas of social change are not as easy to describe because they deal with changes in attitude. Among these are changes to the family structure and high school rights of passage.

Today the forms of discipline employed by my parents and their contemporaries would result in some form of counseling, possible removal of the child(ren) from the home, or some other penalty up to and including imprisonment. In other words, the family structure has been stood on its head- children now “rule the roost” in defiance of parental wisdom with the blessing and backing of the government.

In keeping with the 1960’s “free love” mentality, getting to “second base” or even “going all the way” during high school years was a right of passage and rarely subject to more than parental intervention and./or the occasional “shotgun wedding.” Now, however, the same conduct results in lengthy prison terms for the “offending” male (it is rare that the willing female participant is prosecuted).

Although I have lived through these and numerous other “social reforms,” I still find it hard to believe how much our society has degenerated over my lifetime. The most disturbing aspect of these realizations is the fact that I did not recognize what was happening as the incremental changes occurred. It is only through this kind of retrospective reflection that I have been able to identify these deplorable developments. Shamefully, by failing to oppose detrimental changes where and when necessary makes me equally responsible for our society’s degradation.
