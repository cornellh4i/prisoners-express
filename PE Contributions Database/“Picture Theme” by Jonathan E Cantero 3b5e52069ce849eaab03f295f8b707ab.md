**“Picture Theme” by Jonathan E. Cantero**

September 9, 2019

Kids in Chains

Chained, masked, and stumbling with the naivete of youth through dark streets in a strange city. But this - all of it is new, strange, and unexplored. The unknown lurks everywhere. You only have each other to lean upon, for your actions must always coincide else you would be dragged down and the other would be yanked back. Easy prey for any oncoming devourer.

Who are you chained to? Your twin, a stranger, or something unknown? Can you depend upon him/her/it or will you ever be subject to his/her/its whims? What of this costume, this body sock with its crudely cut eye holes and afro-wig? Why are you hidden and what are you trying to become?

This is not a race in that there can never be a winner. This is a struggle for survival. So rest now, if you must, for a moment but no longer. The other is about to clash and will drag you down the sidewalk if he/she/it must. It would preserve you both if you kept up but if you cannot then know that the urge to live and thrive in a maddeningly inconsistent world is extremely strong despite the constraints and restrictions imposed upon life’s players.

Up ahead is a light, but is it a true light, a light signaling our “arrival” at some point of inflection where things change from negative to positive, or is it the light of a gleaming reflection of hope off another’s wrist? You don’t know, so you must run.
