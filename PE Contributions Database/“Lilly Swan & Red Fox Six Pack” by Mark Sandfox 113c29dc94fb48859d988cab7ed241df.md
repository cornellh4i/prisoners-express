**“Lilly Swan & Red Fox: Six Pack” by Mark Sandfox**

Lilly woke with a splitting headache, the young revelers had been partying all night long On top of that her back hurt something awful from her laden belly. This would be her last pregnancy, her mate had just been recently killed by a drunken driver. A tear welled in her eye. The cool morning air was greeted with a mournful muffled honk. Lilly missed her mate, her heart pulled heavily upon her breast, she needed to be strong for her next clutch. She pulled her bill free from under her snowy-white feathered wing then craned her long neck up towards the clear blue skies. A surge of energy burst forth, she flapped her mighty wings, her chest heaved out of the water. Lily grew taller with every flap, so tall that only her tail feathers touched the calm waters, her bill snooty, uppity, reaching. A long succession of irritable honks broke the pleasant morning choir.

Feathery white, Lilly fluffed back down into the water, then set to preeing herself clean. Her neighbors, the Mallards, paddled noisily by with their brood in tow. At night the Mallards found shelter on the far side of the lake, away from the revelers. Lilly’s side of the lake had far less rubbish strewn about so she shared it with the other fowl during the day.

After the Mallards and their long trail of chicks passed by, Lily set to paddling, she needed to make her rounds. She was gliding along the tall reeds in a graceful silence when out from the matted down grass sprung Red, high and loft, back arched high, black paws and white snout pointed down, reaching for his prey. It was almost as if time itself had stopped, he was stuck, suspended in midair, and then he pounced. A large squeak permeated the air. Red had his breakfast. Lilly waited patiently while he finished his gruesome meal.

“Good morning Red,” honked Lily Swan.

Up popped Red Fox’s head, licking his chops and chewing at the air. “Lilly! Why yes, it is a very fine morning lassie. Did you sleep well?” Red bounded over the clumpy grass then sat by the shore.

“How could anyone sleep with all that noise.” Lily fluffed her feather irritability, then back paddled just a smidge, he was a fox after all.

“Ahh lassie, you still do not trust me. I would never hurt you, you are simply more woman than I could ever handle.”

“But you would not shy away from snatching one of my eggs, now would you”

The Mallards paraded by again, this time at a safer distance from shore. Red licked his moist chops once more.

“Have I ever raided your nest?” Red licked his paws.

“Sam would have plucked your ears from your fur had you tried,” honked Lily, lowering her head in sorrow.

“I am so sorry Lilly, truly I am,” whined Red as he sniffed his way closer to the water’s edge.

Caution set aside, Lilly paddled to shore. She needed the comfort of a good friend. Something caught one of her webbed toes. Lily honked, panic sinking deep. She paddled hard for shore. It tangled her whole webbed foot. She kicked and honked, kicked and honked. It cinched tight and tighter, higher and higher up her legs. Lily could hear barking in the chaos of honks and quacks and frantic splashes, even a low throaty growl. Her flopping frantic head slapped against the water, then hit solid land. Her webbed feet were useless now so she dug her bill deep into the moist shore then pulled with all her might. Slinking like an inchworm, she pushed with her wings and pulled with her bill until she was out of the water.

Red was there, hovering her, eyes fixed and serious. He licked his chops. “Are you okay?” You look like a tangled mess.”

Lily gasped for air, bill agap. “My legs... my feet,” she hissed.

Fear settled in quickly, there were many other animals to fear on land. A myriad of monstrous critters raced through Lilly’s frantic mind. Then she saw the funniest thing. Red Fox pushing an old wicker baby carriage through the matted down grass.

“Can you use your wings?” asked Red Fox.

“How am I supposed to land without my feet,” honked Lilly swan.

Red shook his head, “Not to fly you silly goose, to help me get you into the carriage.”

Lilly did not like being called a goose, not one bit, but she was being silly, so she decided not to nip him. Red pushed the carriage as close to Lilly as he could.

“I’ll push,” informed Red, “You try to pull yourself abroad as best as you can.”

Lilly stretched her wings wide. “Hey” honed Lilly when a wet nose pushed her rump. It was a frantic scene, feathers flying, fur floating, a passerby may have seen it as a gruesome struggle. In the end, Lilly was nested in the wicker baby carriage. Red Fox had his paws atop the handles, body stretched thin and long, pushing the carriage down the road.
