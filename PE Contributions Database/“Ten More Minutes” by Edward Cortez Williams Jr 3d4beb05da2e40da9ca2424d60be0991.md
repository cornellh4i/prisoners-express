**“Ten More Minutes” by Edward Cortez Williams Jr.**

Such a good ol’ dog, Jeffy is.  I named him after my grandpa.  We had a good eight years together.  I’m gonna hate putin’ ‘im down.

Don’t think too badly of me now.  He’s already contracted the Nguyen virus, the virus that’s been turning everyone into zombies, or what they’re calling zombies, anyway.  Ain’t no zombie s’posed to be that dang fast.  And I know he’s slowly turning into one, too.  He’s already rejecting dog food, which is the first symptom. Then they wanna eat fresh meat, the second symptom, which is also hap'nin’, cuz he’s eatin’ all the rats and squirrels he can catch.  I can’t have ‘im eatin’ me, now, you gotta understand that.

I’m glad to see him restin’ so peacefully, believe me.  He deserves the sleep.  He’s fetched me plenty o’ beers over the years, caught plenty of rabbits, and he… he’s just a good dog.  I figure I’ll give ‘im ten more minutes to sleep.  He’s earned it.

I’ll be right behind ‘im, though, be sure ‘bout that.  I can already hear the carnage easing closer to my house.  Soon people’ll be bustin’ out my windows, trying’ to find a place to hide, and that’ll let the monsters in, cuz they’re just gonna follow ‘em ‘in.  And I ain’t got no wood to board up my windows with; plus, I ain’t got the ammo to kill all them suckers.  I’ll put the shotty in my own maw before I let them demons bite me…

O-h, Jeffy.  Jeffy, Jeffy, Jeffy.  What a good boy.  Sleep well, buddy… About ten more minutes, I reckon… Maybe fifteen… Then we’ll pack our bags and go on the long ride, buddy...
