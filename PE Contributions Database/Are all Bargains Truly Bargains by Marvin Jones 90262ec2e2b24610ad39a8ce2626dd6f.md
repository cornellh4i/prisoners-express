**Are all Bargains Truly Bargains by Brother Boston (Marvin Jones)**

Everyone loves bargains…

Bargains, bargains, bargains

Save, save, save

We look to always get ahead,

Have the upper hand in life

But where is the upper hand

When we bargain our souls?

What are you talking about now

Brother boston... you ask!

Well I’m glad...you asked!!

We are quick to go after everything this world has to offer

We love a deal!

Well The Bible tells us not to love the world or things In the World

(I John 2:15)

We strike Bargains sometimes unbeknownst to us with Satan

And he always comes to collect.

If the bargain seems too good to be true

Or too easy to obtain,

They are and should be avoided!

Proverbs 1:19 says “ so are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain, it takes away the Life of its owners.”

Bargains can cost you, far more,

Than they save you!
