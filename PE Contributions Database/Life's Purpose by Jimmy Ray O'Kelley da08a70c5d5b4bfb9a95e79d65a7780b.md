**Life’s Purpose By Jimmy Ray O’Kelley**

As a human being it is impossible to definitively say what my one true purpose in life is. Throughout my life it’s purpose has varied with the different stages and circumstances. So for me, life’s purpose has been to endure, thrive or survive the moment. Thereby, fulfilling the purpose of that particular moment.

In childhood, life’s purpose progressed in stages of apparent necessity. Early on it was just making it to Saturday morning so that I could eat Fruity Pebbles and watch Scooby Doo.

At adolescence it was trying to get “things.” Things your “rich” friends had.

As I grew in age, so did the seriousness of what I imagined my life’s purpose to be. The greatest of all always seemed to be survival. A broken home, gangs, police, drugs, public housing, death and prison.

Yes, depending on how a person grows up shapes his perception of what life’s purpose means. Survival becomes a necessity, and necessity becomes life’s purpose. As sensitive as it may be, it is reality.

Luckily and gracefully, I have survived all things, including prison. Which has brought a new purpose in life: to end the cycle.

I have a new life’s purpose. One that is in contrast to all the things, desires, and thoughts that shaped my definition of life and purpose for so much of my existence. One that has everything, to do with others and little to do with me. I mean wouldn’t life for everyone be more joyful, peaceful, and fulfilling. If our neighbors life’s purpose was to help with the next man?

God has blessed me with three sons! My purpose is to try to ensure that they don’t have to make their life’s purpose survival. I do not believe that prison denies a man or woman the ability to play an active, instructive and influential role in the lives of their children. No, it’s quite the opposite. Experience is one of the greatest tools in life. Accompanied with love, desire, will, initiative and prayer, it is possible to fulfill life’s purpose of making out children’s stay on this planet a better one than what we had.

For me, I find no cause more honorable than to be a father who contributes to the wellness of the lives of my children. Prison walls may physically separate me from my sons but a purposeful life must tear down barriers, break stereotypes and let love guide its steps toward a better day.

Yes, there will be trial and tribulation all the peaks and valleys. But what in life comes easily this is truly purposeful? I am not surprised at all that behind prison walls I realized the most nobel purpose for me: FATHERHOOD
