**"Practical Joke" by Raymond Swanson**

I’ve always been a person who enjoys practical jokes, and because of the people I’ve had in my life, virtually nothing is off limits. I would say fart machines and whoopie cushions are some of the more ‘original’ forms of jokes. Someone puts one in a chair in a crowded room, an unsuspecting person sits down, and laughter erupts.

Of course, they can’t stop there. They never do. Pretty soon, you and your friends are lifting up the front bumper of a Geo Tracker to spin it around in its parking space, or putting a dead snake under someone’s windshield wiper. I have a special opinion about kids in industry. Not literally kids, but more adult children, men and women alike. I spent a summer at a plastic molder company where pieces were counted as they came off the assembly line and dropped into boxes which, when full, trigger an alarm that would bellow. We’d run over to stack the box on a pallet. The trick lay in this step: watch and wait for the guy in the next aisle to reset the machine and run to attend another one. At this point, you forsake your work to hustle over and pull the flap on his box’s bottom. Twenty minutes later, when the machine would go into alert he’d run over there, and upon lifting the box furiously, we would find him or her self in a mess. It may sound like more than a practical joke, but the three college students I worked with who were fresh out of high school got me many, many times before I caught onto the shenanigans of their game.
