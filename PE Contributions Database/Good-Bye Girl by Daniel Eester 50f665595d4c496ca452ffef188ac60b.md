***Good-Bye Girl* by Daniel Eester**

I remember it like it was yesterday. I stood in the rain, watching her board the bus. She turned and gave me one final wave as she folded the umbrella to go through the door.

To this day, I hear her voice, “God bless you, daddy.”

I felt the tears, even in the rain. I walked along-side the bus, following her to her seat, then I put my hand on the window and mouthed, “God bless you, baby. Goodbye, girl.”

I was losing my daughter to the Army. Little did I know that would be the last time I’d see my daughter alive. Goodbye girl, hello angel.
