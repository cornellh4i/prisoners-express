**“Fluidity, a Life Concept” by Emmanuel C. Theus-Roberts**

Eastern and Western life philosophies are very different. Consider the mindset of one who is solution-oriented versus one who is problem-oriented. The former is only concerned with answering, solving, or resolving the question or problem as presented, whereas the latter is more concerned with whether or not the question is even relevant or valid. One is limited by the parameters of a given question, problem, or situation. The other is limited only by the amount of validity they are allowed under the premise.

As you may have guessed, the one with a solution-oriented mentality represents Western cultures, while the one with a problem-oriented mentality represents Eastern cultures. This difference in perspective will obviously lead to drastic variances in the life choices of western and eastern individuals. Doubtful any episode illustrates this conclusion clearer than the story of Yang Kyoungjong during World War II.

Japan had annexed Korea in 1910, provoking tensions with Russia and opening war with China. By 1938, Yang was a young 18-year-old in the then Japanese-controlled Korea. Japan and Russia were in open conflict and Yang was conscripted to fight on the Russian front. Within a year, he was a Russian prisoner. In 1942, he was conscripted by the Russians and sent to fight the Germans. Soon, he became a German prisoner. By 1944, he was fighting the Allied Forces on the German side. Finally, he was captured by the Allied Forces.

Within six years, he had fought on every side of the war as an “unwilling” soldier. Is Antony Beevor correct in saying Yang’s story is “perhaps the most striking illustration of the helplessness of most ordinary mortals in the face of what appeared to be overwhelming historical forces?” From a western perspective, certainly, From an eastern perspective, this could not be more mistaken.

In the face of these situations, Yang did what most easterners would do - first, contemplating on whether or not there was a valid problem. By questioning the validity of a problem, one gains the advantage of stepping outside of set limitations and opening new possibilities. The problems Yang was facing were not how to survive being as a prisoner or what to do once being held hostage, but rather whether or not he should continue to fight or allow himself to quit.

It may appear as nonsense or skillful semantics, but it is far from either. Once being captured, an easterner has a choice of being a prisoner or finding an alternative. Western point of view skips over this possibility due to its solution-ocentric nature. Western thinking teaches an acceptance of the given premise. Once you have accepted the problem as presented, you are bound by its restrictions. Replacing Yang for John from California, his journey would stop as a Russian prisoner.

Perhaps this is what Yang’s story illustrates: western thought is constrained, while eastern thought is boundless. Life is a changing thing, in a constant state of flux. There is little linear in it. Eastern perspectives are fluid in nature. One still maintains first prerogative in eastern doctrines. Perhaps this is why Yang was never just another P.O.W. statistics?
