**“The Suffering” by Daniel Matthews**

****Never have I seen a man like him before. I believe he is the man they call Torque. A man not only incarcerated at Carnate Island, but a man who even as a young boy, has been incarcerated in his mind. Torque is a man that I have seen with such violent propensities that he is the most dangerous man on death row.

But there is also something strange about this Torque. As I write in this journal, I have catalogued the grotesque monsters that have appeared on this island as I have encountered them. It is at this point that I have decided to include Torque. I have seen him slay packs of slayers, survive deadly attacks rom Mainliners, take down the biggest and most savage Marcusmen, and send Burrowers back to where they came from with very proper and permanent burials.

But beyond this, Torque is a man who has been taken immediately to dispensing these monsters back to Hell as soon as they arrived on the island. These manifestations seem to be occupied with Torque. I’ve seen whole packs of monsters and festers stop their assaults on escaped prisoners and on each other when Torque comes near.

The monsters started to appear very soon after Torque arrived on Carnate. They seem to be preoccupied with this man. Almost as if they have all come from the same place. From Hell, or from Torque’s mind. I have seen Torque become so full of rage that he has ripped apart several of these monsters with his bare hands. Impossible strength. But there is another monster that I have seen since the appearances that seems to have a particular connection to this prisoner.

This monster wears the torn clothes of a prisoner, and I always see this particular monster attacking the others. Notably, there is only one of this kind. I have dubbed it the Sufferer because it seems to suffer. This monster seems to suffer pains much more than the fates suffered by the other breeds of monsters. I could not catalogue an execution for this monster’s demonic manifestation. One thing, though, about the Sufferer that is so apparent is that it suffers as much as the prisoner Torque. I have seen Torque consumed with such fury that he seems to go through a transformation.

In his mind, I believe Torque actually turns into the Sufferer.

That may explain his ability to wreak such havoc among the monsters on the island. One wonders if this monster in Torque’s mind could completely consume him in its hatred. There have been times when this creature has ran pass me, believing I might be killed, but it would ignore me and butcher a pack of closing Slayers instead (which is why I’m lucky enough to be alive and write this entry). I have also seen just a glimpse of a huge monster on the island once, down by the docks.This monster undoubtedly had an apparatus on it that resembled the human body of the prisoner Torque.

Whatever Torque’s connection to these Hell dwellers is is uncertain, but clearly, it is Torque who will dispense them from the unmitigated psychosis of his mind.

Maybe it is an effect of the island, much like when the monsters came. But I have actually seen the prisoner Torque become so consumed with rage that he turns into this monster. I have also seen Torque become close to totally losing himself in monster. Only once he calms down does he seem to regain his human, yet dangerous, faculties. What are the monsters of Carnate Island’s conversations with Torque? This writer does not know. I also think Torque doesn’t know.
