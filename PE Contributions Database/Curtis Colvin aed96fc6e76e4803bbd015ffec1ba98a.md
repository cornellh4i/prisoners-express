Laughter. What is laughter? Where does it originate in the body? Why does it happen? Is it the same for everybody? Can it be cured?

It seems like every time you want to frown and have a lousy day, someone comes along and ruins it for you. They have this cheery face and happiness overflowing from them. As soon as they approach you, you can feel your mood changing, like passing the flu off to others instantaneously. It starts with the eyes, whether it’s caused by reading a story-book, hearing a joke, watching a movie or sitcom, or even a person dancing funny. That’s where it starts. Then it’s the brain’s turn, the leader of the body. It processes the stupid stuff your eyes see and then decides to put a smile on your face. But sometimes, it gets carried away. The mouth opens, and your lungs produce guffaws of air to form into sounds coming out called laughter. Isn’t that disgusting?

So why isn’t everyone’s laugh the same? Some squeak. Some are mellow. But some bray like horses or mules, very disruptive. What can we do about it? How does one stop the disease that causes others to change their whole outlook on the day? Well, here’s the secret...Beat them to the punch. Smile before they do. Tell a joke, make a comment, or act like me and dance a funny jig for a second (it always works for me!) That’s why it’s you who gets to change their bad day. It’s like mom says...Laughter is the best medicine.
