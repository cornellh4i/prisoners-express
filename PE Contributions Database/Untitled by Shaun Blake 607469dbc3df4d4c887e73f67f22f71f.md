This picture personifies peace. It exudes peacefulness. Every time I look at this picture it makes a smile come to my lips and peace fills my heart. As does the longing to be the partaker of the love I see. This scene is never something we here inside will physically see or experience. But we find our peace in our own whimsical ways.

Peace takes many forms for many prisoners. One might find peace with music (in all its many forms), within nature (its animals, its vegetations, its geology, etc.) with meditation (yoga, breathwork, guided imagery, etc.), within religion/spirituality (all its many forms), with exercise (weight lifting, walking, running, cycling, etc.), with just enjoying the silence with his family lying in a hammock - within the noise around them, as one prisoner told me.

In prison peace is hard to find. It’s hard to find someone who is trying to seek peace (guards included). But one only needs to look inside oneself to find peace. Peace is in whatever you, as an individual, can find it in, just learn to look - TO SEE! And accept the peace when it’s found. Too many of us believe peace is lost to us because we’re incarcerated. I did for many years. But not anymore.

One of the ways I’ve found peace is in accepting myself as a person of worth. Of worth only because I exist. This has also opened my eyes to the fact that I’ve worthy abilities. I love to put my earplugs in and immerse myself in a good book (I’m presently reading *A Christmas Carol* by Charles Dickens) or writing poetry and other creative writings. I’m transported out of my cell into whatever existence the author has created or what I’m creating. The words aren’t just a bunch of letters randomly combined, marching across a white sheet of paper. They’re new worlds I travel in, new adventures taking me wherever I want to go. I’m not in prison then. I’m in my peaceful place(s).

I truly believe that I’ve learned to take back myself. To take my ability to choose back from the system that had stolen it. Because I peacefully travel across endless worlds, through many situations, in the guise of innumerable entities, I’ve reduced my incarceration to what amounts to the turning of a page or the taking up of a pen or pencil. To me this is peace.
