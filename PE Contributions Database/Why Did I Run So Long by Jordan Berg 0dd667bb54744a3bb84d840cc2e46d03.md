**Why Did I Run So Long? by Jordan Berg**

Shortly after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage I finally came out to my family. In steps of course.

The first person I came out to was my aunt. She is deeply religious; however, she’s supported me through tough spots, so I figured it was the best choice.

I knew she was coming to visit since at the time she was a regular. As I was channel surfing and drinking my morning coffee I came across a TV show talking about suicides.

This episode was dedicated to LGBTQ+ individuals and the sad statistics that go with it. That show opened my eyes, I was determined NOT to be a statistic.

My Aunt Kelly arrived, we hugged and sat down. I went to the visiting room bakery counter and retrieved some items for us.

I informed her that I had something to get off my chest. I broke down in tears to the point of sobbing. She started asking me questions and when she finally got to gay I looked up and said “yeah.”

The first thing she said was “Your brother I could see, but you, no.” We started laughing. A weight had been lifted and running from my true self stopped. (Full disclosure, my brother told our mom in a mother’s day card.)

I realize 100% that the courage it takes to stop running and hiding in the closet isn’t easy and not everyone has the support I do, but to those that’s okay. When the time is right you will know. Don’t pressure yourself. Feeling safe is the #1 priority.

To the haters: because I’m gay doesn’t mean that living in the same cell will somehow make you gay by catching my cooties. This is 2020 and we’re adults. Stop letting others dictate who your friends are. That person could end up being your best friend. We’re people too.
