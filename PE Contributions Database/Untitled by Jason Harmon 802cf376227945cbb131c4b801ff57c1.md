I see new meaning in this old photograph. These two young ladies can be quotes as saying many things about fairness and human kindness. I see their courage in the face of an enormous struggle for women’s rights circa 1975, and what they’re saying is clear: “Be strong! You also have the right to discover your value, recognize your purpose, and live meaningfully.”

While staring intently at this picture my mind focuses on how difficult their lives have been, and how difficult my own life is. The image and all that is represents begins materializing in the same way that stories come to life during a movie. My own lack of experience and shortsightedness introduce themselves to me in a way that I am finally able to accept. Looking through this wider prism, I now realize that what I first perceived to be two flippant girls leaning against a wall is incorrect. These are two strong women holding an entire building up.

It’s safe to say that these two women operate on a different plane. Substance trumps sexy 100% of the time, and the quickest way to upset women of this quality is to neglect their substance. This is what makes me think women are cool as hell! Mindless traditionals that turn back the hands of time is their enemy. They’re out with the old and in with the new. They’re debutants who curtsy for no Queen. Ripped and faded denim...that’s their choice. Marriage will be with whomever they love. They’ll hire as many employees as needed to run their companies and provide equal pay and the best health care for their sisters. This is their cause, so watch them take up that torch of joyful defiance and set the world ablaze with equality, telling humanity that we all have the inalienable right to self-actualize! The mission is wholesome, one intended not to perpetuate the same idiocy upon men as that which has been tirelessly visited upon them, but only the adjust the looking glass.

It’s through this looking glass that I am happy to notice that their sails have forever been filled with competence- no longer shall a women’s swagger be defined by the clicking of high heels and things of little substance. That is wrong! Their swagger needs to read like the sheet music to our favorite songs, something that displaces myopin with the undervalued virtues and boundless skills of women. The animal senses are too simplistic; touch, taste, see, hear, smell, all senses that can be brainlessly engaged by the presence of noisy little imbeciles who piss women off by failing to pay attention to the infinitely larger number of senses that can only be accessed through the enlightened mind. Let us be honest with ourselves and undertake this meaningful experience.

After all, is that not what this is all about: A meaningful experience? I believe it is, yes. Whether it’s the right so this or that group, or the need to discover purpose, meaning, and value in our own lives we can all draw strength in seeing parallels between what appears to be unrelated circumstances. These parallels can be drawn in various mediums. Today that medium is an old photograph, a magical land where I met two courageous women three quarters of the way through the last century, two women who trekked over the decades-long bridge in my mind to help me make sense of 2016, a year in which I pledge to discover meaningful paths.
