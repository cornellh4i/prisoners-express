**Close Call by Teddy Bartling**

So, how do you know if you’re dead? Would you? Would you see Pearly Gates and Streets of Gold or Hellfire and Brimstone? What if, when your body dies, you consciousness or soul or your essence that is really you transitions to a new reality without you even knowing it? Like, if you’re in some sort of accident and your body dies but your mind survives on in another reality physically different where you are completely unaware of being extended to another existence. To me, that’s easier to mentally digest than boring Streets of Gold or Hellfire and Brimstone. Oh, and I have seen the light. It’s more of a flash though.

I’ve had many close calls, especially in Iraq. Gunfire, artillery, tank battles, mine-fields, oilfield fires… It was very intense. There were constant ear splitting explosions with bright flashes of light followed by a persistent ringing in the ears. Plenty of close calls but I survived right? Probably. Maybe not. I did in this reality, the one where I’m writing this down. But I wouldn’t know about a reality I didn’t exist in anymore, a reality where I died, would I?

We came home from Iraq and I went back to work in the Oklahoma oilfields. I worked on oil rigs. It’s hard, dangerous work where, quite often, things blow up like they did in Iraq. One evening after we finished up a well we were all hurrying to go home. The driller restarted the pumping until without opening the flowline valve causing tremendous pressure to build up on the check-value, I was cleaning the wallhead and scraped the check value with a wire brush when, BOOM! Bright flash of light (my imagination?), deafening roar and then that damn ringing in my ears. Man, my butt was burning and wet. Oh my god! I thought, I musta blew my ass off! So I felt with my hand--WHEW!-- it’s just oil. Not blood. Another close call, huh? Or was it?

On another rig, another location, another day, maybe even another reality, we’re trying to unset a packer on an injection well about 7000 feet down. We’d turn the pipe 8 turns only to watch it reverse itself and turn back 8 turns. It would not unset, even turning it with hydraulic tools. THe diller unknowingly pulled about 85000 lbs on the pipe while another crew member was turning the pipe. Nothing, then BUMP! I felt it through the soles on my boots. I looked up into the derrick not even knowing what I was looking for. The sun was blinding me so I stepped back about 2 feet for a better look and the company man stepped exactly where I had stood. Since I didn’t see anything up top I looked back down the well. BOOM! Bright flash (NOT my imagination), and that ringing in my ears again. I remember looking over my shoulder and seeing the blocks (picture a block and tackle the size of a hatchback) fall on the company man. His reality sucked in that moment. But, wait… what? How am I seeing this behind me over my shoulder? He was 2 feet in front of me a split second ago. Adrenaline! That had to be it. Adrenaline must have put me in the IS past the wellhead, tools, and crowd of men (all of whom were injured) without getting a scratch on me. I just wished that ringing sound would go away. Close call.

At a later time in South Dallas during a different chapter (reality?) of my life when we all carried guns or dope or both, it happened again, I don’t remember what, exactly, just the BOOM! Bright flash, ringing… I woke up at Baylor Medical Center a week later with no recollection of how I got there. Still don’t know. And nobody seems to know either.

In my latest episode, my last wife absconded with my son (not his mother). Seems she liked the younger ones. She’d hatched a plan of using him to “off” me and cash in on my life insurance policy which she’d made herself the sole beneficiary of. To make a long story short, they came back the next morning and he stabbed me in the chest. A punctured lung. No BOOM! No bright flash or ringing in the ears, at least not yet. I made him pay for it before I blacked out. Later, at the hospital I faded or they put me under or I hit the end of another reality. Darkness. You decide.

BOOM! Bright flashes, ringing… I open my eyes to see a hard rain beating on a dark window. Thunder was still rolling when the nurse said,

“That thunder must’ve brought you back around.”

“No,” I said, “That thunder was me coming back.”

She didn’t get it. Some piece of medical equipment, undoubtedly keeping me alive, was ringing so the sound wasn’t just in my head. After I came out of ICU some cops questioned me about being stabbed but rather than tell them my son stabbed me, I told them nothing. The day I left the hospital, I was arrested for a gun I never had. Through a sick twist of fate for not telling on my son for stabbing me, I go to prison for crimes I never committed.

So here’s where things REALLY start getting weird. Court was a sham. In prison, civil rights are tramples, medical issues ignored, and people really do get treated worse than animals. And in here, people really do go to prison all the time for crimes they did not commit.

One hot night in a cell on a hard bunk, I dream a weird dream. A guard at the yard I was on, who always had his eyes on me, put me in a chain link holding cell called “cool off '' for a fight. I’m pacing in the heat and starting to rant while he stands watching me through the chain link.

“You feed me crap, violate my civil rights, lie to me, ignore my medical issues… what the hell, man?” I yelled and slammed the fence. “In what universe can you get stabbed in your own living room then go to jail for NOT talking to the police about it?

“This one,” he said, standing there impassively looking through squinty eyes. He stepped up to the wire, “You don’t know? You really don’t get it?” he asked.

“Know what?”

“You’re dead Jack. You died the morning he stabbed you. Or, at least, your body died. Your essence or being or soul-- whatever you call it-- never dies,” he said. “Well, no, wait-- that’s not true. Your son who stabbed you? He has been erased from the universe. THAT was the unpardonable act,” he said, unsheathing a baton.

“Wha-wait. Who are you? You’ve been eyeing me since I hit this yard and you look familiar as hell.”

“No one,” he said, eyeing me while he unlocked the gate. “But I’m always there when you have a close call. Your time is up,”

“Huh? Whatever-- let me outta this hellbox, then.”

“No. I mean your time here is up.”

Bright flash, loud thump, ringing in my ears…
