**“Level 4 Prison” by Chad Dias**

I know the fear of being placed in a hostile environment. I know what it’s like to have your will to survive kick in. I know what kind of prayers men pray in appreciation, for surviving another day. I know the immense emotional strain of being away from both family and friends. I know the joy felt when you’re able to see them again. I know what it’s like to fight alongside men who, prior to, you never knew. And I know what kind of bonds these experiences can ultimately forge. I know all this and I’ve never enlisted. Rather my knowledge comes from being sentenced and convicted to life within a maximum security level four prison.
