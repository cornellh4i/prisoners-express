**“Fear Babies” by Jevon Jackson**

“You have a gift,” his grandfather told him, about six years ago, when he was a senior in high school. “You can see the manifestation of your fear, as well as the fear in others.”

Michael and his grandfather, Roy, were sitting on colorful, tattered lawn chairs, on his grandparents’ back porch that summer evening. His grandfather, taking measured sips from a can of Old Milwaukee, continued to explain how “the gift” had ruined Michael’s father. How the very fear of the gift, itself, had chased his father further into an anxiety-riddled spiral, which led him to abusing drugs and overdosing from heroin in his pick-up truck outside of Wendy’s, two days before Michael’s 5th birthday.

His grandfather told him how he, himself, had squandered the gift by suppressing it throughout the years until he ultimately became blind twenty years ago, in his late 40’s. All the first-born Lakota men had the gift, and now it was up to Michael to learn how to use it for the sake of his children’s children, and all the first-borns that come after.

“You must, first, confront your own. Your fears.” his grandfather instructed him, calmly swatting away the mosquitoes swirling about. “Confront them. Face them. Name them and they will fall away.”

Until the rest of his grandfather’s six-pack was gone, Michael listened. Although he was mostly skeptical that this was one of is fantastical stories, like the story he tells about the shaman who could shoot bright, baseball-sized balls of fire from his belly to heal the infirm and the sick, Michael still listened intently because in every one of his grandfather’s stories there was a universal lesson to be learned.

As the years went on, and his grandfather passed away, Michael ultimately graduated from college and immediately began working at a big advertising company in lower Manhattan, New York. And never once did he see or experience any supernatural manifestations of fear, as his grandfather had suggested. Well… until today.

Throughout the workday, Michael noticed a couple of weird things around the office. With Sarah, the ever-smiling receptionist, there was a seven-foot tall dark figure that loomed ominously behind her ergonomic chair. This silent man-like figure had no discernible features. No mouth. No eyes. Dull and dark ashen skin. Sarah didn’t seem to notice at all. Same thing with Vicky, his project manager. Chained to opposite ends of her desk, there were huge, dark gargoyle-like figures that sat soundly on the floor. It appeared that Vicky was oblivious to the creatures -- their featureless faces and the long black horns jutting, like curved sabered blades, from both of their skulls. In one moment, Michael could see these shadowy figures as clear as the people standing next to them, and in the next moment, in the batting of an eyelash, the dark figures wouldn’t be there. Michael just rubbed the stress from his eyes and figured that these extra-long workdays were starting to take a toll on him.

After work, standing on the platform, waiting for the subway train, Michael snacked on a granola bar. All he had for lunch was a bagel. Out of the corner of his eye, about 30 yards away at the far end of the platform, Michael noticed two small dark figures staring at him. They were both child-like with jet-black, tight curly hair. As the subway train approached, he crumpled up the empty granola wrapper and tossed it in the garbage canister. When he looked again, down towards the far end of the platform, the two dark figures were gone. He looked around. Just a few people scattered about. The train slowed to a stop. He got on and took a seat in the half-empty train.

As he scrolled through the unread messages on his phone, Michael couldn’t help but overhear a young couple, sitting two seats behind him, arguing over the girlfriend being too flirty with boyfriend’s older cousin. As Michael took a quick glance behind him, to get a better look at the couple, he noticed the two shadow kids with curly hair standing at the back of the train-car. They were chained together at the wrist, standing there, motionless. Although they had no lips, no mouth, no eyes, he could feel the intensity of their gaze directly upon him. His heart began beating faster. He didn’t know why. Why was he suddenly afraid? They were just small shadowy, harmless apparitions and nothing more, he thought to himself.

Michael immediately got off at the next stop, even though his stop was three more stops away. The two small dark figures followed and chased after him. Michael found himself sprinting up the stairs of the subway and through the uncongested evening streets. He didn’t know where he was. He just ran as fast as he could down the sidewalk. Quickly glancing behind him, he could see the two shadow kids closing in on him. The scrape of metal from their long, conjoined chain skidding across the pavement. Their swift, tiny footsteps rushing closer.

Michael suddenly opened the back door of a random yellow cab and jumped in. Frantically fishing fifty dollars from his pocket, he shoved it through the partition slot to the cabby.

Almost out of breath, Michael said, “Just go. Go… Hurry!”

The cab sped off. Michael looked out the back window. The two chained dark figures were standing there, sullen, yet defiant, in the middle of the street. It looked like they had grown taller.
