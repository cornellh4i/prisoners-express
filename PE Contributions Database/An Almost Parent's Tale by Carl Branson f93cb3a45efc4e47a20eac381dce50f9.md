**“An Almost Parent’s Tale” by Carl Branson**

****Almost is one of those nebulous terms commonly associated with a failure of some sort. The second place competitor can claim that he “almost won” the race. An accident survivor can claim that he was “almost killed.” This parent’s tale deals with both successes and failures within the embrace of the concept of “almost.”

In the early fall of 1982 my wife was experiencing gastrointestinal problems. The recommended upper and lower gastrointestinal radiological exams were scheduled. This proved to be the starting line for moths of emotional upheaval for us. The medical staff made the critical error of not doing a pregnancy test prior to exposing Pam’s abdomen to the x-ray tests. The problem being that x-ray exposure, especially early in the first trimester, is disastrous if not fatal for the developing fetus. Yes, we later discovered that Pam was about four weeks pregnant post-conception at the time. To further complicate matters, state authorities shut down the x-ray lab on the following day for exceeding maximum allowed radiation output levels from the equipment.

The gastrointestinal testing results indicated that the digestive problems were the consequence of a pedunculated uterine fibroid tumor, which would shift and impinge on the bowel. Additional intramural and intramuscular uterine fibroid tumors were also identified. The radiologist, who was either unaware of or disregarded the pregnancy test results, recommended a hysterectomy to resolve Pam’s digestive tract problems. Our immediate reaction was that this recommendation was an attempt to prevent a malpractice suit over the provider’s failure to follow established pre-testing procedures; therefore, second medical opinions were in order.

The first line of inquiry was to my three brothers, all of whom are doctors. Their opinion was that the fibroid tumors were far less critical than the effects of the radiation exposure on the developing zygote. Since none of my brothers specialized in OB-GYN, they recommended checking with specialists in the field, and we did check with six of them.

The consensus was a good news/bad news opinion. The good news was that the pedunculated tumor was palpable and could be manipulated through abdominal massages to eliminate the intestinal obstruction. I became proficient with this procedure in short order. Additionally, the other fibroid tumors could be safely removed with minimal potential complications for future pregnancies. The bad news was that there was no available data regarding the potential effects of the radiation on the developing fetus. Terminating the pregnancy was recommended. Although none of the six specialists consulted would perform the abortion, the all recommended the same gynecologist for the termination procedure.

It was the abortionist who gave us the first glimmer of hope on a very dark horizon. His recommendation was to wait eight weeks, watching for a potential miscarriage. In the absence of a miscarriage, a sonogram and amniocentesis would be performed to confirm or deny damage caused by the radiation exposure.

After another eight weeks of uncertainty, the sonogram revealed what appeared to be a fully, properly formed baby with all body parts accounted for. The amnio results revealed no identifiable defects and confirmed sonogram suspicions that this was a girl.

Our miracle baby was born in July of 1983, a beautiful little blue eyed blonde. Eighteen months later she had an active baby brother. Three months thereafter, Pam was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer, which took her from us in the summer of 1989. I was now the sole caregiver for five and six year old bundles of joy.

This arrangement lasted ten years. In 1999 the state decided that I should be in prison. For reasons beyond the scope of this missive, all contact with my children was effectively terminated. Now eighteen years later, my children are strangers to me. In the world of almost, I am, at best an “almost parent.” Certainly, I have sired offspring. But did I adequately satisfy the parental responsibility to mold his children into well-adjusted productive members of society? I don’t and probably won’t have the answer to that question due to my current circumstances. Then, of course, is the nagging question of what if Pam and I had chosen the recommended hysterectomy back in 1982? How would that one decision have changed the current course of my personal history? Needless to say, the world of almost is plagued with an endless list of “what ifs” that could change the results of any situation--be it a race, accident or relationship.
