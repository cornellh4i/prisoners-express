**All Alone by Chad Dias**

The lone wolf

Is who society labeled a loner.

Yet to him, it's more like society disowned him.

The lone wolf

Is who society labeled reclusive.

However to him the truth is no one chose to include him.

The lone wolf

Whoâ€™s loneliness began to consume him

Until his plain became a sense of rage

Aimed at all those who mislabeled his crudely

Or treated him rudely.

The lone wolf

Who was merely a wolf like all the rest.

However his sense of duress

Drove him over the edge.

Neglected, disrespected and feeling alone,

He willingly chose to live a life within a metaphysical reality.

Because it had to be better than living out the rest of his days in this reality where he is psychologically and physically all alone.
