**Close Call by Shawn E Ingram**

Around a year ago now, I had another inmate, that I thought was at least somewhat trustworthy, put a tattoo on my leg. This was the third tattoo that I had received from this person so it seemed all was good with our relations. Apparently I was mistaken.

We completed the tattoo on Thursday evening around 7:30 pm and Friday afternoon (11 am) I had to self declare a medical emergency with a 103° fever, my leg was extremely infected.

Apparently, unknown to me until much later, my tattoo artist didn’t want to pay me his store debt so he soaked my neele in exploded (boiled) AA battery acid immediately prior to my work.

The medical staff say that I am very lucky to be alive. They say that the alkaline poisoning essentially put my system into sepsis. God took my retribution away from me by transferring my artist before I could react to my newfound information and knowledge.

The tattoo and my leg are healed and a minor discoloration of my skin in that area is the only evidence of this event occurring but I will never forget the three days I spent believing I was at the end of my journeys. I had a full panel of blood tests and all came up clear so, to this day, I consider this my “closest call.”

Although I love ink and tattoos, I feel that it is kinda a depression relief such as cutting with the difference of art instead of scars, I would caution my fellow prisoners of the true risk of some dirtbag trying to do you in. I got lucky “this time”.
