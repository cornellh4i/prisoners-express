**One of Arizona DOC’s Finest Moments by Thomas Combs**

I knew something wasn’t right when I left for morning chow that day. It was nothing more than a feeling, a convict’s intuition, perhaps, as I observed the strange mannerisms of some of the other prisoners.

I had been in prison for 7 years now. By this stage, I had seen more than enough to realize when violence was in the air or on the horizon. I was in general population for 6 years before coming here to Protective Custody. Not sure how this is Protective Custody though. More violence occurs in PC than in any yard in Arizona. Where it be in stabbings, 3 or 4 on one assaults, group rapings, you name it.

It was no business of mine. It was fall of 2018 at Buckley Unit in Buckeye, Arizona. When I was waiting outside after leaving the dorms, getting ready to make my daily walk of 3 times, morning, afternoon, and evening to get my food. While standing and waiting for the guard to yell that it’s time to head to the chow hall, I was getting some fresh air and enjoying my first cigarette of the day.

As the guard yelled our signal to begin our walk, I made my way to the very end of the line as usual. I don;t trust anyone in this or any other person in the wretched environments. Even the staff, they’re just as corrupt, if not more so, than the other inmates.

As I made my slow way up the aphat trail, I noticed a guy in his mid-thirties kind of off to the side standing still, watching every person and looking them in the eyes as they passed him by. He was twitching with nervous tension and shifting his weight from foot to foot, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket.

I kept a watchful eye on him as I shuffle along at a slow pace. All of a sudden, 3 hispancis stormed out of the middle of the chow line hurriedly running towards the anxious man, with long shinning homemade blades at their sides. All 3 of them suddenly attacked him, stabbing him numerous times repeatedly.

It was a vicious attack not leaving much chance for the victim to defend himself much less attempt to cover up to avoid some of the more lethal attack attempts.

All of the sudden my body quivered at the sound of a prison alarm shrieking like an out-of-control bull-horn. I instantly fell to the ground interlocking my fingers on the back of my head, face down against the asphalt as the guards began yelling “Get on the ground! Get on the ground!”. I then head rapid gun shots. Pow! Pow!...Pow! Pow! Pow!... Pow! Pow! The shots came from a gun tower not far from where I lay face down on the pavement. I knew for certain all parties were dead without even looking as the guards only fire live rounds. My mind froze.

After the prison came off of hard lockdown, which means no movement by any inmate for any reason (even medical won’t see you during the times of hard lockdown), when I found out about the news. Apparently, the nervous twitchy guy in his thirties was named Joe, and he was in debt for drugs over $2,500.00. He had been stabbed eighteen times, and shot once in the thigh by one of the tower gunmen.

An inmate whom I was familiar with and witnessed the stabbing told me, “He was crazy. He never stopped fighting. They told him to stop, but he kept going. It was like he was chasing death and wasn’t going to stop, no way, until he caught it- until he rode it out of here.”

This was an everyday norm. Just another day in Protective Custody. I never figured out how this was classified as such, because I’ve never been protected from anything, but those times are for another story.
