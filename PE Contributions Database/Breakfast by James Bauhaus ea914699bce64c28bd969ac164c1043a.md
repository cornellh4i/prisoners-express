That's me; Breakfast, for a horde of hungry piranhas, each and every one of whom is employed by the government. First, there were the lazy cops, who helped the killer escape forever by hiding his blood, which they had collected off the street along his escape trail. They used this blood trail, but not he blood, to lead the jurors to their finger pointer. She didn't want to point at an innocent teenager, but, when the cops threatened HER with jail, she was fine with helping them lie me into prison and helping the killer escape.

The public defenders were likewise happy to assist the killer in his escape for no other reason to go along to get along. How could they advance their fat careers as lawyers by defying the prosecutor judge team for which they work? Their own advancement up the ladder to prosecutor, judge, politician, and "lobbyist" cannot occur without riding their bosses' conviction coat-tails. Catching killers is secondary or tertiary to political advancement.

The prosecutors were happy helping the cops lie me into prison for them. If it ever got out that the killer was actually a career tulsa jail trustee and professional cops' snitch, there would appear a blemish upon the cops policies and procedures. If I was able to get free of their false conviction, they feared that I may try to sue them for torturing me outside and inside their police station. None of them wanted that.

The judge? He's just a highly paid flunky who does what his prosecutor wants. He helps his prosecutors obtain convictions as he quietly writes the paychecks and maneuvers the taxpayers into increasing the courthouse budget every year. One famous Oklahoma judge loved his job so much that he bought two auto-suck machines to pleasure himself during trials. He got away with this deviant behavior for ten years in Sapulpa, Oklahoma before FINALLY a disgruntled female employee snitched him off. (He had promised her a free house to be his mistress. He should have given her the house. He had 26 of them.)

The appeals judges help the killer escape because that's what they do: they confirm what the cops, pd, da, and judge trick the eager-believer jurors into doing-slapping their "GUILTY!" buttons as if they were the contestants on Family Feud. Everything flows very smoothly when existing prejudice is confirmed.

The legislators all refuse to "check and balance" the crooks in the judicial branch. Though this is their job, all the politicians love it when no waves splash on their gravy train.

All these gov-crats eat plenty of breakfast like me. We recently discovered this during the last three "botched" executions where the gov-crats' victims writhed in agony for up to 30 minutes before finally being hideously murdered. One lawyer-apologist said they'd death-sentenced 900 victims since 1975, when lawyers were given back their privilege of death-sentence. Then it was told that 144 death sentences were found, through DNA proof, to have been given to innocent victims. Simple math (144/900) shows us that, AT MINIMUM, the lawyers' death convictions are of the innocent 16% of the time. This failure rate is too high for any business to survive, but gov-crats get away with it easily.

It also means that, when the cops and law-crats trick a jury into killing somebody, he has only an 84% chance of being actually guilty! And this is their BEST CASE scenario!

So, all citizens should be very alert, especially to gov-crime, because every day, the odd becomes greater that the gov-crats are eating YOU for breakfast!
