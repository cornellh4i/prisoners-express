**“A Double Holiday Celebration” by Chadwick Majamay**

My birthday falls on the last month of the year! Yeah, I’m a December baby. So my birthday event does not fall on my birthday, December the 17th, but twelve days later on Christmas Day the 25th. Here is the run-down of that exciting day.

It starts at five in the morning when I’m showering and putting on my birthday suit, ready to party! Then at seven, the family starts filling in and we sit down and ‘talk stories’ and chat it up while we chow down on my mom’s homemade jelly doughnuts and sip hot cocoa.

Then at nine, it is time for Christmas breakfast over at Aunt Mailee’s house. It is the same traditional breakfast of chicken and pork adobo (meat soaked in vinegar and fried to perfection), scrambled eggs, rice, buttered muffins, and orange juice.

After breakfast at Aunt Mailee’s, we file over to the Hilo Hawaiian Hotel to celebrate Christmas and my birthday at the buffet! This is when the famous Aunt Mao Iani smothers me with gifts and money! Oh man! My first birthday she gave me a whopping $1100 and $50,000 college fund! I don’t remember my first birthday except for all the hugs and kisses from the family, which made me cranky.

Then at 6pm, it’s time to hit the Prince Kuhio Plaza and go on a spending spree! The whole family is there until closing time at 9pm. The last birthday I had (my seventeenth) I went big, buying hella fancy clothes and the latest electronics getting ready for graduation and college.

Oh! How I missed those celebrations in 2008 when I was first imprisoned and during my early adult years! Those were the days!
