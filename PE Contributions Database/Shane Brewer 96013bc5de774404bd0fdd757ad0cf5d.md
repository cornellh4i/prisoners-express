I hate getting my hair cut. When I was little, my mom would let me grow it out, and I would look so cool. Still to this day I’ve got the longest hair in my family, and I’ve got longer hair than anyone in my block. But the side is half cut, LOL, that’s the only time I get my hair cut. I just love long hair, and getting a haircut makes me feel half destroyed and gives me kind of like an anxiety attack. That’s crazy right? Say no to haircuts!
