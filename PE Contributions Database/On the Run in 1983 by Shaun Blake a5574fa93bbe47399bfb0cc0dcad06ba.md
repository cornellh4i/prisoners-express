**"On the Run in 1983" by Shaun Blake**

Just after dark on an August night in 1983, four of us broke through a door of the Juvenile Detention Center and disappeared into the surrounding residential area. I was only 15 years old at the time.

We kept to the backyards, traveling quietly. This is safer than the streets as we’re less likely to be seen and caught. I came up the rear, my head swiveling, searching for pursuit. My eyes coming back to Don, who’s just in front of me. My heart pumps adrenaline through my veins like water through a fire hose, causing sensory overload. I saw better in the dark. I could hear more acutely. My sense of smell intensified the various scents--rotting garbage was more sickly sweet, freshly mown grass huskier, the pet smells more pungent...and a sharp oily, musky scent of fear clinging to us like skunk’s spray.

Over a fence and slink across the yard, over a fence slink across a street, over a fence...as we come over a fence this dog appears and attacks Mark. We scatter like shrapnel from a hand grenade: Mark pulling away from the dog and over a fence; Sonny, he seems to disappear; Don and I, back over the last fence, across the yard, over fence and across two more, then dive under a huge trampoline.

Breathing hard, we huddle under the trampoline, listening to the sounds of the dogs and home owners coming out to see what is going on. Time drags slowly by until the dogs’ irritation fades and the alarmed residents go back inside. It’s finally quiet. The quiet becomes as nerve-wracking as the earlier commotion. Not hearing or seeing anyone for a while we creep from under the trampoline, through a gate, out to the street. We hurry around the corner, down a couple blocks, then back to the backyards.

After another rest, Don and I continue as before, but with greater care and looking out for Mark and Sonny. Mark encounters us. He’s been hiding in a doghouse and hears someone coming his way. He sees it is Don and I and comes barging out, scaring us to death. Crouching beside the doghouse, Mark shows us his torn shirt and bloody wounds. He tells us it looks worse than it is and he’s okay. Nobody has seen Sonny.

Starting out again, we make it out of the area without any more incidents, to safer streets. From here mark leads us to an apartment building where he knows a friend lives. Fortunately she’s home and agrees to give us a ride to a safe place for the night. It’s a room in an old house that’s used by some local teenagers to get laid in private. We jump in her car and 10 minutes later we’re there. Parking in a back lot we get out, thanking her for her help. Signalling us to follow, Mark leads us down a set of steps into a dark room. He flips on a light as Don and I step inside. We stop abruptly as we see our night’s accommodations.

The room’s about 15 ft x 20 ft with peeling, yellow-ish brown wallpaper; a shit-encrusted, piss-stained, holey carpet; a ceiling so badly stained with long nicotine exposure it’s almost black; and a closed door across from the front door. A sickeningly musky odor permeates the room--a mix of shit and piss (human as well as anima--cat) and adolescent sex. The sex smell is coming from a beat-up, stained mattress in the corner with an assortment of dirty, rat-eaten old blankets and pillows stained with splotchy, yellowish substances strewn across it. There’s no furniture and no windows.

As Don and I are taking this in, Mark’s telling us he’s not staying but will be back in the morning to get us. With these words he’s out the door and gone.

Don and I stay frozen for a long time. Don suddenly starts, looks out the door and back at the scene before us shaking his head. He then walks over to inspect the “lovenest”. I head to the closed door, opening it...I’m immediately bombarded with the rankest odors of shit and piss, and the horror-inspiring sight of what the inside of a port-a-potty would look like after a tornado takes it for a spin. I’m knocked backwards with its intensity. Covering my mouth and nose I think I’m going to puke. Acid rises to the back of my throat making me gag and swallow convulsively. I hurriedly shut the door before something in there tries to come out. I move over to Don hoping he’s having any luck.

He’s standing next to the “lovenest” with his right hand over his mouth and nose. He reaches down picking up a blanket that looks like a pack of hyenas have been using it to rub their asses on. As he lifts it, it starts falling apart like a damp cracker when you try to pick it up. Don turns an alarming shade of green (that I’m afraid I reflect) and drops what’s left of the blanket and bolts out the door. I’m close behind him.

In the back lot, we’re puking our guts out. Finally, still dry-heaving, we stand up and look over at each other. Don wipes his mouth and says, “We’ll never see that f----r again.”

“Yeah,” I return, wiping my own mouth and looking into the night. “I think we shoulda stayed at the Center.”

As it starts to rain, Don looks up dejectedly at the sky, groaning. He walks back into the room mumbling, “I don’t like being on the run.”

“Yeah, me neither,” I say, still looking into the night. I look up into the increasing rain, letting it clean my face. “At least we’re free.” Then I follow Don back inside.
