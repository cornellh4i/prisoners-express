**“Organism Help” by Antwon Housey**

The hands of humanity are always in use. Humans should take greatotice of how much helping out their hands do on a constant basis. The hands are of so much importance to the functioning of the body as a whole, because of their constant helping out. The hands become low in regards of significance. When asked about their favorite body parts, 99% of humans will never mention their own hands. I personally give thanks to the creator for allowing us to be blessed with the structure of five fingers and a palm. Without the help of our hands, we would have a difficult time doing all things. The left hand washes the right hand. Both hands wash the face and the remaining body parts. Try to brush your teeth without the use of your hands. Stank breath will ultimately be your result. Feeding ourselves would be such a hassle if our hands did not help us out. Even though they do not get the reverence they deserve our hands still lend a helping (one or two). The moral of the story is to be thankful of the help you receive from your hands because if they ever decide to quit one day we would not be able to find a greater alternative. Mojuba goes out to all those capable hands.
