**Arguments by Jenilyn Duncan**

Closing arguments in court; arguments over what to do today whether to get up or lie in bed - going through my mind. What will I do with my time?

My first choice is to pray because I need help from a higher power - I can’t do prison on my own. Navigating arguments isn’t too bad because no one has a quard with me. I fly under the radar.

Sometimes people’s devils get the best of them and they act out of their fear or anger. Arguing with words can be really hurtful.

One can demolish another’s emotions with just a sentence or two. All of us in prison have been “sentenced” before. Can we all just get along? That would take commitment and accountability to one another. I look forward to meal times but who knows if we will have another incident before then. I think incidents should be isolated to the unit its on! Why is it that the whole place has to lock down? I guess we have to take time for reflection when we should be able to get up and move on.
