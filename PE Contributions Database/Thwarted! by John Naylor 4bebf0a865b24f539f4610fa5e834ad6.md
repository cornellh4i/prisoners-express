**“Thwarted!” by John Naylor**

I sat in 1-1D in G-cellhouse in July of 2015 and waited for my downgraded, delayed medical treatment. I wasn’t given my glasses, my medication, or anything at all—just the clothes on my back and a mat to lay on. I had three broken bones in my right ankle. Despite some books available (which I couldn’t really read because I’m nearsighted), I wasn’t able to self-entertain. Though the blows from the state continued on, I found I wouldn’t receive my legal work for at least three weeks. Cruel and unusual punishment despite innocence had only begun.

I got a response from the district court saying my habeas corpus had been denied with prejudice. Apparently my reeling had only begun as well.

Years later I rely on my research much more than the words of fools and extortion-minded individuals. I dodged all the conduct reports at the facility level due to innocence that time around. Though my motion to expand PC-1 was denied. Little did I know courts could have excused my delay due to innocence. So much for knowledgeable, experienced advisors. Never trust your life to a jailhouse lawyer.

Law clerks may mean well at time, they’re not evil. Let this be a cautionary tale. As I was thwarted from Corizon. Had I known my right I might have been home now. I encourage you to drop $25.00 postage paid for a Georgetown Law Journal, if only to fact check attorneys. Avoid ineffectiveness like your life depends on it, because it does.

Some injuries are worse than physical ones, and just as permanent. Yet, we must have heart and continue on. I now wait for the innocence projects.

I’m not ashamed.

I’m stronger.

You can be stronger too.

Even if you only grow from some weird accident.
