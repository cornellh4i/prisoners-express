**Sexy Nerd Body by Jevon Jackson**

My body has been pinned behind walls, gates and razor-wire electric fences for the past 26 years. My body was just a young growing teenage body, at 16, when I first came in. Now the ong guys call out “Hey, Old School!” towards my body, and my body acknowledges and reluctantly answers back.

I remember when my body felt invincible, when every testosterone covered thing in my five-foot nine-inch frame convinced me to believe that I could win a jungle fight against a lion and chase down a quarter-horse at full speed. Now I am intimately intertwined with the cold, inevitable mortality of my body. A few years ago, after collapsing during standing-count like a falling timbered tree, crashing my face (chin) into the floor, unconscious, and awakening, dazed and bloodied, in the crowded emergency room, shackled to the bed, needing seven chin-stitches and a three-day hospital stay to monitor the pneumonia I didn’t know I had, I am now fully aware of the fragile, odd, breakability, of my body.

My body is caught in this sort of physiological dissonance where the gray flecks peppered in my beard usher me onto the elders, yet when I am clean-shaven my old high school friends react “Oh my gawd, you still look the same!” Hypothyroidism, an autoimmune disorder, has drastically slowed my metabolism, and if I don’t eat properly I feel slow and sluggish, yet my body doesn’t desire much to eat as in years prior.

My body needs cappuccino-flavored coffee to kick its engine start in the A.M. My body prays for silence and solitude, but settles for a cellmate or a neighbor that doesn't cause anxiety and stress chemicals to flood throughout the blood veins. Stress stretches wide inside the environment, so my body listens to the timeless slow grooves of Sade, to recline a few precious moments in God’s divine graciousness.

The untattooed light brown skin of my shea buttered body craves to be kissed by the bliss-worthy body of a woman’s warm supple skin. My bold poetic body awaits the comfort and connection of her shy, neurotic, intelligent body to hold, protect and praise. My sexy nerd body seeks out its smooth eccentric match.

My 42-year old convicted body is neither dangerous nor a hazard to the most gentle parts of society. Yellow cabbage butterflies have landed safely on the epidermis of my skin and taught me the proper gossamer of things, which I long for.

Right now my body is full with cinnamon raisin bagels and Rumi poems and scattered, disconnected ideas about Writing. Tonight, it will likely pre-dream of Freedom and envision the day when it will walk between the opened gates and rightfully join the sun in the unencumbered industry of unbending luminescence.
