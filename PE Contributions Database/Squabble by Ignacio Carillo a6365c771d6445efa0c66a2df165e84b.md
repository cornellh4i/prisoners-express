**Squabble by Ignacio Carillo**

On their last visit my parents and I had it out. A real scorcher that led to the guards intervening. See, my parents suggested that I had failed and that’s when I knew this was serious. You have to understand my point of view, my folks are pathologically supportive. It’s in their culture, their upbringing, their very DNA. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary--including my current residence at one of America’s finest gray bar hotels--garnered over the past 40 years, they still think I’m wonderful and can do little wrong.

I believe that has something to do with how I turned out. It’s not their fault exactly. They just backed the wrong horse. God bless them. How were they to know? I showed a lot of early promise: honor student, varsity athlete, college grad, veteran, blah, blah, blah. But, sometimes I think, if they’d just made it a big tougher, deprived me of a few things now and then (money, opportunity, love) I wouldn’t be in the mess I am in now. Still, you have to be philosophical. These things happen. Lives turn out wrong or not at all. It’s no big deal, it happens all the time for all sorts of reasons. Jeez, people die of starvation or thirst; men are tortured, women raped and every other conceivable atrocity--and don’t even get me started on the poor children. No one is doing any of those things to me. I’m not being tortured or starved. Hell, I’m not even hungry and could stand to lose a few pounds. I should be grateful. I should be jumping for joy. But, I’m not.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I lack my usual vigor for life, my ambition, my drive. I’ve become soft and passive, overly sentimental. It’s gotten so I throw games of Scrabble and tear up during cheesy commercials. And so I blamed my mom for giving me too much love and attention, for not making me tougher. I yelled at my dad for giving me too much allowance, for not forcing me to get a job or hustle as a kid.

A lot of people think it’s easy to have it all: tall, head full of hair, loving well-to-do family, all the opportunities you could ask for...let me tell you, it’s not. It can seriously stunt your growth. Not that I’, complaining, you understand, I know I can’t complain. In fact that’s the hardest thing of all. You can’t complain. What sort of jack-ass would complain? And yet, I want to complain. I want your pity. It’s sick, I know. Maybe I need help? I definitely need help. But, who is going to listen? No one. Even I don’t want to listen. In the story of my life I’m not even the sympathetic character.
