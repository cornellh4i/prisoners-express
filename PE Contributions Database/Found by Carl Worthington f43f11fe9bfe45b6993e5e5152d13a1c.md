**Found by Carl Worthington**

****I’ve been searching all my life, but I’ve yet to find what I’m looking for. Will it ever be found? Peace, love, serenity, happiness, fulfillment, my paradise. Will it ever be found? Will I search all my life in vain, becoming more disillusioned, angry, and bitter everyday until I am a misanthropic monster? Or will it be found, my heaven on earth, my Eden? I’ll never give up hope or surrender to negativity. I’m a warrior, a survivor, and I will win at this game called life.

What I have found is knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. I’ve found compassion and forgiveness in my heart but not, so far, from other people. I know they’re out there somewhere, these good, loving, caring people, but they are like unicorns, ghosts, or leprechauns. I’ve heard of them, but I’ve never seen or met one. I hope I will one day. Until then, I’ll keep growing, healing, and mastering myself. And of course, I’ll keep searching. Maybe all I’m really searching for is myself since although I’ve been lost all my life, I have yet to be found. I often wonder if some lost soul out there is searching for me as I search for her, another alien like me stranded on earth amongst all these mortals. Is she reaching for me as I reach back for her, my twin flame, my lonely princess, my sacred, feminine goddess? Will I ever be found? Is she even looking for me? How can one find what one is not even looking for? You might walk past a treasure and not even realize it because you weren’t searching. However, when you do find what you’ve been seeking for so long, love it with all your heart and soul. Cherish it. Hold on tight and never let her go. Then you will know that in finding her, you yourself have finally been found.
