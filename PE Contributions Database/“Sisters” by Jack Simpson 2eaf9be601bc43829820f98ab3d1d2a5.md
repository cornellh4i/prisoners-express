**“Sisters” by Jack Simpson**

There is something special about having a sister. This is a true testimonial of how I feel about mine. Our age difference is around four years. Even though she is older and I am considered the baby of the family, she got her way a lot more than me. She was daddy’s little girl.

We grew up in a small town in the south. It was a quiet little town and we called it our Mayberry. The only difference was, the police here carried guns, and have never had any problem in using them.

The street we grew up on is called “Republic”. There were three cotton mills at that time in operation, owned by a company that has gone on for decades. That is how the street got its name.

I know most people have heard the word “hand-me-downs”. We were blessed to have two older brothers. Once they outgrew the clothes, they reached me. We'll just say I was riches to rags. They weren’t much use for anything else. I sure wasn’t going to wear no dress. I love my sister but that would be taking it too far.

My sister had braided pigtails when she was young. Our next to the oldest brother, along with his friends would pull them to make her cry. This would bring me running to her aid. Nobody messed with my sister. Not even our brother.

We have been close all our lives. When she had to raise her three daughters, I was there by her side. I was an uncle and a part-time dad to the three.

All she (my sister) had to do was ask and I would be there to help. Even if it was to cut grass or babysit her children. Of course, mom and dad were there to help too. All mothers need a break.

I could remember coming home from school and could tell someone had been baking. The smell of fresh chocolate filled the air. To me, it made my mouth start to water.

My sister had motioned for me to open the refrigerator and there sat a white porcelain plate, a mound of devil food cakes, chilled to perfection. If you know me as I do, I just had to try one or three.

This is what sisters do for their brothers. I will tell you, no store-bought cake tasted anywhere close to the one made with love. It is always great with a glass of mom’s tea.

When my sister was young before I was born, she was sick and had colitis and most small-town doctors in the fifties didn’t have a proper understanding of how something like this would drain the life out of a person.

Most people don’t get it in life. When you have one sister or none how important of a part she plays in one’s life. She is very precious to me. Once she is heaven bound, I can and will, reflect how wonderful I had a chance to share my life with her.

I would advise anyone young and old who has a sister to hug them and truly let them know what they mean to you. Take them out to eat and surprise them with a special gift.

The best gift I have ever received growing up is my sister. That is the reason “I love her”.
