**“A Fable” by Rachel Staudte**

“Hurry up,” said the goose, reclining on the wicker carrier on wheels.

“The party begins at a quarter ‘til nine, and you will be my rick.”

“Why should I?” asked the fox, lifting his head only to yawn. “Last time, I checked, you weren’t royalty - just a big, plump bird fit for the feast. Walk there yourself, if you want to get there so bad.”

“How ill-mannered! Do you know who I am?” puffed the goose, “I am not your ordinary pond-dwelling goose *but* the Mother Goose.”

“Hmm, I don’t think so,” the fox replied, “from what I understand, the old bird was fond of bonnets and shawls and simple rhyming poems for children.”

“Simple? *Simple*? My poetry is not simple. Do you know how hard it is to entertain the children.”

“Yes, in fact, I do. I’ve got five kits at the den right now.”

She shook her tail feathers irritably. “Fine, whatever. But I *do* own several bonnets and shawls. Not for everyday wear - too impractical. It’s for the pictures, of course.”

“Pictures?” The fox stretched, rolling onto his back and staring at her upside-down.

“Yes, pictures for the books.”

“Ah, yes. The famous Mother Goose books.” He flipped onto his belly, paws tucked carefully beneath him. “Would you care to recite one for me?”

“G-good gracious, no,” stuttered the goose, “I haven’t the time.”

“Sure you do - it only takes an hour to get to the party. You could tell me on the way there.” Languidly the fox rose, almost pouncing on the metal handle of the goose’s carrier.

The goose turned her head and gulped, “ Okay, okay, I lied!”

“Knew it,” said the fox and pulled the handle all the way to ground.

It was like she’d been launched from a catapult. “Ahh!”

The goose spread her wings, but the fox caught her in his jaws before she could fly away. “For my kits, she’ll be a most welcome surprise.”
