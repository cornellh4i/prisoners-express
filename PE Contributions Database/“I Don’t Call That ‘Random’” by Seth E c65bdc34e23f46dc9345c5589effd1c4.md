**“I Don’t Call That ‘Random’” by Seth E.**

I’m less than a year out of high school when I see her on the cover of a weekly city newspaper*. I’m smitten. I tell a coworker “this is the woman I’m gonna marry.” The article describes three girls on the cover as part of the Young Socialists Club at their high school. The internet is around, but few people have regular connections (if they even own computers), and searches are often fruitless, so I use the phonebook* to look up the school’s number. I call, explain that I am a reporter with a different paper, interested in interviewing these Young Socialists-- “please have one call me.”

When it happens, the student who calls is not Her, but it’s a step. I admit my deception: I am not a reporter, I just want to learn more about socialism and what they do (this is not a total lie). She invites me to the regular weekly meeting of the Socialist Workers Party at a local book store*-- an independent one (naturally).

At the meeting, a well-respected socialist has traveled from back east to speak to this 30-odd people. I hear none of it-- there is The One, and I am under her spell. We talk afterward; there is chemistry. I attend more meetings. We agree to meet for coffee. I join the SWP. We go to rallies and marches, sign petitions, travel to striking union demonstrations in solidarity…

We are in love and become roommates. One day, post-coitus, we debate the likelihood that the FBI really *is* surveilling the bookstore. I came clean: “I’m not actually all that *into* socialism. Honestly, I only joined the party so I could see *you* more often.” She laughs.

“*I* only joined to be around *you*,” she counters. We decide to quit going to events, stop paying dues. We are still in love. We get married, as I had predicted (I also confess the full truth of how I’d lied and such to meet her. She does *not* see this as “stalkery”-- it is “*romantic*.”) Within about 18 months, we divorce. I do not suggest choosing brides based on “*love at first sight.*” Moving on...

Years go by. I have a job that requires me to fly 4 or 5 times a year, and I fly for personal trips once or twice a year, too. I *love* flying; it is a joy, every time. Except for maybe security.

Those familiar with TSA screening may also have experience with the *special* screening process assigned to (supposedly) “random” tickets. The normal screening is tedious-- metal detector walk-thru, an x-ray of your carry-on, a lot of waiting, not a big deal-- but *special* cases, they get invasive. They use a wand, pick over your clothing, eviscerate your carry-on, get demonstrations of your electronics… it takes a while longer after all that waiting to get to security.

When I fly, I get special TSA screening. Every. Time. So 5 to 10 trips a year, security both ways, means special screening 10 to 20 times a year. I have heard it said, when I was a kid, that you should arrive for your flight about an hour early. Once TSA ramped up after 9-11, they said *two* hours ahead. When I fly, I give myself *three* hours.

But now, jump to today (August 2019), it’s been ten years since I last flew, and I miss it. I miss airlines, baggage claim, the weird 70’s chairs, overpriced doodads in the gift shops, strange waiting spaces with big broad-leaf plants, culturally local art in major spaces, the “moving sidewalks,” the tiny drinks and snacks in-flight, arm-rests with unused ashtrays in them, all of it. When I EOS in a few years, I will gladly put up with four or five hours of TSA screening so that I can enjoy the flight from northern Florida to upstate New York, with the final reward of seeing my family at the gate when I land.

But I will also wonder-- as my meager possessions are scrutinized in detail by TSA personnel, thoroughly-- whether the screening is a result of my youthful association with the Socialist Workers Party. And even if it ended badly, I must admit-- she’s worth it.

***young people, ask an old person what this is.**
