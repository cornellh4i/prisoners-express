**"Man in Black" by Corey Higgins**

In this event where a man dressed in all black holds his brother, the white latex gloves showing well. For this man in black is a professional killer. Two days before all this went down, Omec younger brother was taken by a group called the “Chosen Ones” a small but powerful terrorist cell in Iran. Their MO was to make sure Omec would be willing to kill a target set up in a high tech building with US troops protecting the man called Osagi, which was their mean target. They claimed he had information on the terrorist cell and their whereabouts. Omec or his code-named by the US when the completed his training, no one really knows his real name. Though some say he’s Iranian or Indian, one thing for sure after working for hire, he’d retired and laid down his profession.

He’d lived with his younger brother “Omor,” he’d gone to college and got his degree in “Media Arts and Design.” He did designs for big companies in Iran, even US. Sometimes if he was lucky. Omor was going to a arts class to show off a few designs, but no sooner than leaving the apartment that him and his brother stayed at, right by the corner of the complex a black minivan pulls up 3 men jump out and before Omor could say one word, he was gagged and bagged riding in a minivan thinking they’ve come for my brother…

By the time Omec finds out, he was already making phone calls about work plans on a small company for computer programming. His brother was going to design his logo’s, as he got out of the car on the sidewalk, he noticed the black marks on the pavement. He turned a whole 360 taking everything in, even down to the length of the black marks. As he went in the complex he dialed his brother’s cell, on the 2nd ring a man answered and in an 8th of a second, Omec knew someone kidnapped his brother.

“Where is Omor?”

“Mr. Omec you’ll get an email on your phone with a date, time, and target. Best complete the assignment or no more “Omor.” Goodbye…”

Short and sweet, and down to the point, he thought not good. As he went to the apartment on the 4th floor, which was small two bedroom with nice leather sofa and chairs. As he pulled his suitcase out from under his bed which was under a Keypad, he punched in the code so the floor would not blow up in a minute. He plugged his cell phone into his laptop as he opened the suitcase, and took out his old gear of knives and guns. He opened the email and the file attached to it, he sent a reply back hoping they would read it saying to call back with proof of his brother still alive. Then he set up a trace file within the email to find out who, and where they are.

As he studied the information on the building and the blueprints that he’d backed into the US files.

He’d hoped that he would not have to do this mission, not only was he retired, but the building was almost untouchable. Once he’d given up on them contacting him again, they sent a text message with a picture attached to it, showing his brother naked and hanging from a rope. The text said “try to trace us again and your brother dies!” He felt stupid, but now he was beyond pissed off.

He picked up his pistol and one long-range rifle with 50 cal ammo and went to work. Instead of making a bulletproof plan which he did not have time for, he went on instinct and drove a few blocks from the building. Two US soldiers stood out by the entrance fully ready for combat, only they were really not. As he walked by he’d pulled out his 40 cal pistol with a silencer, and shot both of them in the hand before they could even lift up their rifles. Once everyone stopped yelling and crying for help he was already 4 blocks down setting up his 50 cal, he knew or hoped once they seen the attack they would wait a while clearly it out and move the target to a new safe spot. Which he would then take along rung shot from 4 blocks away not too far, not too close. Plus at this rung bulletproof windows would not hold up to a 50 cal shot. Two shots, one the window, two the target. As it played out two shots went down line planned, and a clean getaway took place. Only a naked dead Omor was found dead in their apartment, Omec plots revenge as he holds his dead brother in all black...
