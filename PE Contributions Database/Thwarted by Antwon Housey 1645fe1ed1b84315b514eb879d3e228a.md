**Thwarted by Sincere Ogunda**

Throughout all of “American History”, the so-called founding fathers of this land thwarted its inhabitants with some type of warfare. Before those nefarious settlers began navigating the seven seas, the Natives were already established upon these shores, minding their own business. Biological warfare was unleashed upon these unsuspecting peaceful people. Smallpox caused many Native deaths, ultimately forcing them to give up their land in order to save their bloodlines. In return, they received some bullshit, a story in one chapter of the public schools’ history books - a weakass holiday in the month of November. Thanksgiving is a major celebration of how the Europeans thwarted the Natives into giving up their land and dying off to extinction. I wonder if the few casinos they have on their reservation sites compensate for all the lost tribes. The Africans who were brought here in chains and shackles have been thwarted since the boats started to sail. This country was founded upon the formulas of being thwarted and being content within one's thwarted state of mind!
