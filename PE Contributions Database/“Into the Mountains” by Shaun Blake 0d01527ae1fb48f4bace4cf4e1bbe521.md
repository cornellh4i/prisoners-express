**“Into the Mountains” by Shaun Blake**

****Leaving the village of grey stone houses and narrow, dirty streets of Canty that clung to a hillside above a little stream, there spanned an old bridge that wasn’t hard for the twins, Deanna and Dianna. The muddy streets and sloping village green where they grew up had only bad memories and no future for them. So when Charlies showed up, telling them he was there to escort the two to the Academy of Twins, they were more than eager to accompany him. Delay could only end in disaster--death or separation. They would not survive separation.

Neither of them knew exactly where they were going, and they had never been further than a couple of miles of Canty in all their fourteen years. They grew up on the streets, surviving by their wits and tutelage of their thieves’ guild without parents or other siblings. Essentially, they were alone. Now, with the promise of companions like themselves, twins that, together, could yield magic, the future looked to be happier.

Riding gentle horses provided by their new patron, Charles, they travelled eastward toward the Amaranthine mountains and their forests of the same name. Far ahead could be seen the gap between two mountains and the high peaks beyond and above through which they must travel. The Academy of Twins, a two week journey across the plains and up into the great mountain range, is the only outpost beyond the low fringes of the forest. This seclusion is necessary because the training provided is difficult and dangerous until control of the magic is obtained.

The days were uneventfully as they followed the road that took them across the plains and into the hills. A turn to the left and up a low rise, the ground is brown, yellow, back to brown… The grass waving in the rising breeze also tugged at their cloaks. Despite their warm attire, they were chilled in this new environment but not intolerable so. Charles informed them that it would get far colder where they were going. As they ride, they enjoyed seeing fields encircled by low stone walls, farmers plowing around them, and scattered farm buildings and animals in the background. The early shoots poked through the already sown ground, and there were trees here and there.

Moving on, the landscape changes: fewer and then no farms, more trees, less fields, rougher roads, and less civilization. Looking back, Deanna saw the sporadic lights of the farmhouses recede into the dusk of early evening. In the following days, they trudged across drainages Charles named for the twins. The forests, however, were silent. Large trees, ancient beyond memory, appeared in greater numbers, arching high overhead and blocking out the days’ sunlight. The surrounding environment revealed deep recesses of dimly-perceived paths winding away into the underbrush.

Over a slope into the mountains and down, they rode into and across a lushly-vegetated valley with a broad stream that ran along its bottom. Fish darted away from the horse hooves. A deer raised its head, hesitated, then bounded off into the forest and was closely followed by its dappled fawn that was hidden in the tall grass. A handful of birds were in the surrounding trees or on the ground, pecking for the elusive worm. The trail cut off through stands of oak, pine, and hickory. Shards of sunlight filtered through the canopy, impaling their surrounds with light arrows. Deep among the trees, no light shined through, and in the green shadows thick with underbrush, saplings struggled to grow. The temperature continues to drop, but now the colder air had a crisp, clean taste refreshing to the Twins.

On the last day, the darker the ground, the narrower the way. A twist to the right, a widening of the way. They rose over a saddleback, around a bald-headed, snow-encrusted peak, and down the other side, moving into and out of the snow zone. They finally emerged northeast of the Twins River, and then they passed through a small cut and onto the Academy plateau.

Stopping just inside the clearing, they saw the oak, pine, aspen, and birch all around the fringes of a long, flat valley. In the middle, there were verdant grasses, shrubs, flowers, trees… and buildings of all kinds and sizes with empty courtyards and an archery range.

Pointing to a large, semi-fortress looking building, Charles tells them, “Welcome to the Academy of Twins. Your new home, ladies.”
