**“A Light” by Dillon James Gresham**

Sometimes it’s hard to be focused on the past, present, and future. So hard that people lose sight of the things left to be grateful for, the reasons to be thankful. Well, let me enlighten you on something every human can be thankful for, and that’ll help guide your train of thought. Be thankful to be alive. Even if you’ve been through hell, or are going through hell, the fact that you’re alive shows a light. Be thankful for the air, without it, we’d all be dead. Be thankful for your sanity, and be thankful for your God. These are all lights we share. We may not all share the same God, whether you serve Allah, Jesus, Mother Mary, St. John, Satin, Odin, Thor, or whoever, there is still some hope of God to show the light. Even those who believe they are gods, or that science is God, there’s still light. Even those who are blind can appreciate that light. Even those who are truly insane will be thankful for life. Once you accept to be thankful for life, it will open your eyes to everything else to be thankful for individually. Not everyone is healthy, or rich, or has family and friends, not everyone has food and water, or clothes. There are things we will all lack that others have, but one thing we all have is the light. Even if you can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, just be thankful to know it’s there and once you search enough, you will find it. It’s just a light, but be thankful for it.
