**Warning: This Story is Full of Spiders, Don’t Touch it! by Catherine LaFleur**

I have three gears in the morning: stop, mosey and amble. This irritates the officers because they are always yelling at us to put some pep in our step. There I was moseying along to my job in the Law Library when a limb fell out of a tree right in my path. Really it practically fell on me. You can imagine I was pretty startled by this. Officer Morlock, standing nearby, ordered me and another inmate to move the obstruction out of the street. And that’s when the trouble began. Beatrix on one end and me on the other, all together now lift. Then a wave of red spiders erupted from the wood and swarmed over my hands, up my arms and into my clothes and hair. Scream! And scream! And all together now, Beatrix, scream!

The other inmates pushed us down and started whacking us with their coats then dragged us--still screaming in tandem--into the Modality room and began yanking off our clothes. Officer Morlock followed, screaming “Don’t touch them.” Still our fellow inmates continued with the whacking of the coats and slapping of the hands, we were pummeled mercilessly. Officer Morlock was humane enough to call in a medical emergency. Once we got to the nurse, she gave us a cursory inspection and declared no bites were evident. The inmate orderly carefully shook out our clothes and combed through our hair looking for any arachnids. Fortunately, no attackers remained.

And then…… and then, within twenty-four hours I had a lump (not a bump) along my spine. It grew and grew like something out of a horror movie. Of course I went to medical and declared an emergency, at 2 a.m. in the morning on the Eve of Veteran’s Day, much to the delight of Nurse Houlihan. Now I have been in prison for a minute and due to my cult upbringing I will not seek medical treatment for what I consider to be minor issues. I would have to be carrying my own severed limb before I’ll admit a nurse or doctor might be needed. Additionally, I was still traumatized from a surgery and hospital stay which occurred months before. This seemed a little serious and I think I might have been running a high fever at some point.

Nurse Houlihan acted pretty bored when she saw me. Once I stripped for her inspection she became really excited. The swelling extended from my spine all the way around my waist and into my stomach. It was raised like bread dough and hard. When she poked it, I screamed “Don’t touch that!” And she screamed when I screamed. So all together we were screaming. The medical officer had to run back to the infirmary because she thought there was an attack.

The next thing I know, the nurse is pushing me face first onto the gurney then dialing the phone for Rasta Doc, who is on call. She comes back and jabs me with four needles. That made me groggy after a few minutes. I think I might have been a little delirious because I remember getting in the elevator and forgetting why I was in the elevator. I was having a flashback to that movie The Believers, where spiders lay eggs in their victims which then hatch out of the victim’s body. The medical officer had to lure me out with a peanut butter cup. Then, I think I passed out. By the time I woke up, it was morning and Rasta Doc was prodding me. He didn’t seem too startled by my immediate screaming “Don’t touch that!”

Hmm….. I thought, this might be a little serious since Rasta is here on a government holiday. He just went tsk, tsk, tsk, and ordered the nurse to take me to the surgical room. There he informed me I would have to be cut and drained. Okay, okay, just cut me Doc, because by this time I was in agony. The swelling made my body feel like I was being bathed in scorching lava. Thank goodness he numbed me up. Slice. And then something really terrible gushed forth. Let’s just say it was beyond foul. The situation wasn’t helped by me throwing up everything I’d eaten for the past ten years.

I had to stay in the infirmary. They had to clean the wound every few hours because the bandages would become drenched. I was a leaking superfund site. Plus it had to be stripped and packed several times every day. The nurses all had a turn squeezing me like the Blueberry Girl from Willy Wonka. Nurse Houlihan remarked I would have an interesting scar. I said “When I’m asked about this, I’ll just say I was shanked by the medical staff. Don’t mess with them!”

My friends were worried about me. You could hear me screaming every day all the way outside of the building “Don’t touch that! AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!” In this matter I was not shy. You’d think I’d never experienced pain but I assure you that I have been through natural childbirth, twice. This was worse.

My friend Marina with whom I share books sent two Sci-Fi’s up to me, David Wong’s In the End Dave Dies and the sequel This Book is Full of Spiders, Don’t Touch it. The latter being about interdimensional spiders which hatch out of your brain and run amok eating people. Of course she did it just so I could keep my mind off the pain of my own arachnoid troubles. Thanks friend.
