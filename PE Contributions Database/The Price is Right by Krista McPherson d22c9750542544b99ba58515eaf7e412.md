**“The Price is Right” by Krista McPherson**

1 dollar. That’s the amount of money I always bid. It didn’t matter if it was a set of Ping golf clubs or a Kenmore washer and dryer set. I always picked the same amount: one dollar, Bob. My grandmother, Dottie, was in charge of watching me while my parents were at work. She would always bid 1 dollar higher than the highest bid. Nine times out of ten, I was victorious.

I always wondered what it would take to be one of those pretty models who showed each product. For one whole summer, I modeled every appliance in use and every picture frame on the wall, especially those featuring me. Not a single pot of green beans simmering on the stove went un-modeled; no item was excluded. If it was in the house, it was fair game. Nothing was safe from my hand modeling, not even Kizzi’s food dish. I learned the hard way that not everyone appreciated the hand modeling, particularly not my grandma’s poodle, Kizzi. After the second or third bite, I stopped trying to convince her how delicious the Purina was. I gave up my hand modeling career shortly thereafter.

Everything became a game to me. I was convinced I knew the price of everything all because of Bob. Colgate? $1.49. Uncle Ben’s Spanish Rice? 79 cents. Automatic Stove Popcorn? $1.09. Dottie found this knowledge of mind desperately entertaining, so much so that my dad would call her up and ask why I was putting price tags on everything and demanding she identify “Bob.”

Bob Barker taught me the importance of a “Brand New Car” and the joy that anything “Brand New” would bring me. He taught me to always spay and neuter my pets, and that even if you lose a game, you still get a chance to win in the end.

It’s been a long time since I’ve had Bob Barker grace me with his television presence. Fortunately though, Bob Barker is still a fantastic presence in my life. One a month, I am happy to say, when the corrections officer hands me a bag of Bob Barker Sanitary Napkins (for free!), I run up my 8x10 ft prison cell and hand model that package of pads for nostalgia’s sake and because I would have made a damn good hand model.
