**"Bill's Island" by Kevin Vorshak** 

Lisa didn’t know how to react. Her husband stood triumphantly before his creation- a creation an addict might design for a turtle enclosure while under the throes of hallucinogenic bliss. A flock of blackbirds burst forth from the trees. They appeared to be fleeing, and she wished she could flee with them.

"So what do you think?" Bill asked.

"Well…its certainly different," Lisa said.

"You don't like it."

He looked so crestfallen; she wanted to hug him. " I didn’t say that I didn’t like it."

"Then you think it's stupid."

She fought the urge to throw sand in his face. "Let's just say I’m trying to understand the purpose of an island that's barely offshore."

"It's a demo," Bill said, relaxing." Think of it in the same way that a builder will display houses. Interested buyers can tour them."

Lisa regarded the island. The ugly block-shaped building, the scraggly trees, the pointless little steps running inside what she assumed to be breakwaters. It looked like something child with a bucket, shovel, and a few sticks might build on a beach. "I guess I still don't get the desire for an island located on the shore."

"The demo is on the shore. We will build the island wherever they want it."

"Does it float?"

"No."

"Then how do you build it in deeper water?"

Bill shrugged, "I'm still working that out."

Making his way up to the block building, Bill leaned against and continued, "It's like that old saying 'every man needs an island.' Well, now they have one."

Lisa joined him on the island, but sat in the shade of one of the trees. Looking out over the horizon, she admitted to herself that she felt relaxed. They she looked over her shoulder toward her husband only a few short feet away, the scraggly scrub of vegetation fighting to gain a foothold in the sandy soil, and that awful looking block building; and reality came crashing back. "I believe the saying is more like 'every man is an island; and I'm starting to think that once you go deeper you find it's barren."

"Ha ha, very funny Lisa," Bill came over and sat beside her.

She smiled disarmingly at him " I thought it was. Seriously though, what about food and water?"

Bill beamed," I'm glad you asked. Let's see if it works." He stood, brushed the sand from his jeans and reached toward her.

Clasping his hand, she allowed him to help her up. "See if that works, bill?"

Producing a remote, Bill pushed a button.

Somewhere inside the island, a low hum began. Lisa sensed a slight vibration emanating from the ground. "Umm…Bill?"

He walked to the front of the building and looked down at a square block opening directly in front of the block building. "The island in built around a desalinate. Fresh water will come out just above the well," Bill said pointing to the square block opening, "flow into it, and after filling it drains by the spillway where it returns to the ocean. I plan to use the system to help cool storage for food."

"So where is the water?"

"I don't know."

Just then, water spilled from the block building behind Bill, soaking his jeans and almost knocking him into the well. He scrambled away and stared dumbfounded at the rushing water.

Lisa laughed.

"Not funny Lisa."

"It's absolutely hilarious, Bill."

He kicked at the ground. "Now what am I supposed to do!"

Lisa watched the water cascading from the building. After a few moments she said, "Well, I suppose you could put a slide on it."

Bill stopped and stared at her. His inscrutable look made her nervous. Suddenly he grabbed her in a strong bear-hug, lifted her from the ground, and spun her around. "That's it!" he said.

"What's it?"

"Water parks! We can market it to waterparks! Lisa, you are a genius. Heck, maybe we can design our own water park."

"Ok, put me down now."

He set her down, and she reached up and tousled his hair. "Being your wife is never boring."

"I love you too, Lisa."
