**"Simple Pleasures" by Elzie Henson**

Different lifestyles, different pleasures. Another day, another time like the weather that has its moments. One day it rains, one day it snows. Our body's temperature stays warm, although we feel the cold like an animal in the wilderness that knows it's way around. Like when it marks its territory on its own ground, knowing the place when it has to remember as if home it must enjoy. From a long trip back on return, knowing all paths must lead to one direction. Whether if a curve, straight, or crooked way, one-step in significance of enjoyment. It's used to its pleasures that are simple, yet are hard for (us) to come to terms of understanding. As a mother who cares for her young in love, pain, or danger, she will do whatever to protect from harm. Whether a snake, opossum, raccoon, or dog, they fulfill their youth with love, care, and charm. As a child growing up in realization of fun, whether it's running, playing, throwing a ball, or swimming, we all share the fun and pleasure as everyone. Ideas of the matter is somebody, everybody, anybody, has joy, peace, love, with desire knowing the pleasures out of life are simple. So take a moment to lend an ear to hear, an eye to see where things take form, holding one's hand as well, as when playing to have fun, yet we must keep warm. Life is all of understanding of learning to make it what we will, as well as the moves we all make in choosing our own moods and pleasures in too simple moments.
