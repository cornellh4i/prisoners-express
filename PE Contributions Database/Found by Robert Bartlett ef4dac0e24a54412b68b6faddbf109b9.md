**Found by Yankee Lawyer**

My children were snatched by a highly connected prostitute on February 7, 1997. I reported her crimes to the police, and they arrested and put me into an insane asylum. Doctors admitted to the court that they found nothing wrong with me, and I was released but not allowed to return home.

I have been searching for my children for over 18 years.

The abductor was my children’s biological mother. She was well-known to the police. She broke my son’s arm twice. The first time was shortly after he came home from the hospital (he was delivered prematurely and almost died). The second time was when he was about 5 months old. I went to the store to get him some medical supplies, and when I returned to the apartment, his arm was swelling. She broke it again.

I tried to get help from police and social workers. They were inexplicably cruel. I tried to get help from physicians. They collected enormous sums from my insurance company then refused to talk to me. I tried to get help from the court, but Pamela found me before I could get in to talk to the judge. She hid my children and held me with the aid of armed accomplices until the police came.

I know this sounds bizarre, but court records and other documents show that it actually happened in the U.S.A., in the dirty, dirty South, in the Piedmont Triangle area of North Carolina, one of the world’s leading centers of child pornography production, distribution, and consumption.

Pamela moved around a lot, and I followed my children from city to city. The insurance company sent me monthly itemizations of payments for medical care. My children were constantly being treated for injuries like a ruptured hymen or an amputated ear, or trauma related illnesses like costochondritis. I always knew what hospital they were near, and I could contact local police and schools.

Pamela admitted to the court that I’d been locating my children through medical reports. She said she wasn’t going to use my insurance anymore. The court made me continue the premium payments anyway.

Most of the local officials were in Pamela’s pocket, but after years of relentless effort, I received a lawful court order which Pamela’s lawyer advised her to ignore. On June 9, 1999, as I was preparing to file a contempt petition, I was again arrested.

I’ve been locked up for over 17 years.

A few years ago, I established my girls’ approximate locations and learned that all three of my children were in the Burlington area of Alamance County, North Carolina. Nonresident prison staff raided my legal papers and destroyed much of my information about my family and friends.

The Innocence and Justice Clinic of Wake Forest University School of Law located my son and tried to get in touch with him. They immediately received threatening phone calls from Pamela.

My children are full grown now, but they are still afraid of their mother (not without reason--most of my friends and family are dead or missing), but at least they know someone is watching them and that a father’s love is forever.
