**"Jungle Man’s Pancakes" by Andrae Stradford**

One day in D.C., it was raining hard and the lights went out and the storm passed agonizingly slowly. It poured relentlessly for six hours straight. The day became night and the sun was hidden behind thick black, unhappy clouds. It was boring and my mother tried all she could do to keep three boys from tearing up the house. We played Trouble, Sorry, Clue, I even made spiders on my Dr. Dreadful set. We all got bored so my mom fired up the gas top stove and cooked us jungle man's pancakes.

Jungle man's pancakes are pancakes with banana chunks. These were the first pancakes I learned how to cook on rainy days when it was pouring. I still reflect on the day mama taught us to make them: put butter in the pan, pour in butter, wait until air bubbles appear, then flip and press down slightly and serve.

My mother made breakfast during a downpour storm to help settle her children. She knew we loved to cook and learn how to cook. She always knew exactly what to do.
