**“Envy Misplaced” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

At times prison can feel as if you’re inside the Twilight Zone. As if up is down and red is black. It can be a world within a world of a world all to itself. Prison is full of surprises, both terrifically fantastic and spectacularly horrific. Of course those are the extremes of the wide range of experiences to be had in this peculiar environment. Many are more mundane, falling into the norm of regular experiences of people fortunate enough to live for outside of the Twilight Zone. One such occurrence is envy or jealousy.

In life we may find a million reasons to feel the tickling of the “Green Monster.” Our hair may not be as full-bodied as so-and-so’s; or, might be falling out at twenty while so-and so’s is full and thick. Our physique may be far less than this or that celebrity or model. Our financial situation may be drastically different than so-and-so’s. The list goes on infinitely, and in prison reasons for jealousy are equally voluminous.

Many of us feel envious because others have what we do not or cannot have. There is a reason why someone has this or that and we don’t— the consequence of sacrifices made. In the case of prisoners, many guards and people in society express jealousy over the seeming ease and luxury of prison life. Many feel prisoners enjoy too many privileges, while law-abiding citizens can’t afford the same luxuries. Critics say prison should be harder, less comfortable, a more severe punishment. Wrongdoers shouldn’t be rewarded is the basis for such jealousies as why inmates get three free meals a day, television, music players, exercise equipment, access to higher education, special meals for holidays, and so forth. Allow this to place things in proper perspective.

Reality in prison is soul crushing. Can you imagine waking up and not being able to do whatever you pleased? No sitting on the front porch watching the sunrise, family sleeping safe and sound? Can you imagine 99% of people you know abandoning you? Coworkers, friends, spouse, family even? Can you imagine no safety or security, not for your person nor property? How about living with the real possibility of enduring violence for no reason, because another inmate just wants to lash out? Can you imagine being made to disrobe for a search of your person? Or how about being placed in a concrete cell with chains, leg shackles, and handcuffs, with no clothing save boxers, for four hours? Can you imagine not knowing if the food you’ll get today will be fully cooked or rancid and rotten? Can you imagine stressing and worrying everyday about all the people who abandoned you because there is nothing more connecting you to the real world, other than memories?

Now, imagine this was what you awoke to everyday for one, four, fourteen years, or the rest of your life. Now, imagine the only reason you continue living in the Twilight Zone— the day that never ends— is because, you hope one day something might change. Can you imagine being that person? If you can, then, now, imagine not having all those small privileges— no television or music player to drown out reality. No special meals to bring back missing comforts of life. No education to stimulate the mind. Just grim reality and extreme deprivation to accompany it. Finally, I want you to imagine not losing your already tenuous grip on sanity, or not committing suicide.

Prison as it is is punishment enough, pushing some over the edge even now. Sacrifices made and consequences paid being considered— can you really begrudge a prisoner such trivial conveniences? Especially, when any inmate would unhesitatingly trade shoes with you or even a homeless person to return to the land of the living.

Envy in the Twilight Zone is a strange thing indeed.

Our envy of others’ situations can often become a motive for feeling sorry for them. Especially, when we learn, even part, of what they gave up to enjoy what they now have. Sometimes the sacrifice is small, other times it’s disproportionate. Considering the prisoner’s situation you may feel impulsed to apologize for jealousies.

Fortunately, no apologies are necessary. You couldn’t know the sacrifices made. In all honesty, I would rather you never make them.

No, in this case no apology is needed.
