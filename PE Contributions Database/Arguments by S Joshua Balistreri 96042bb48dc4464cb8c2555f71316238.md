**Arguments by S. Joshua Balistreri**

We all have arguments. Conflict is just part of life. Some stem from long held, firmly and deeply rooted beliefs, and others out of sheer stubbornness. Beliefs are hard to change, but stubbornness will usually abate with patience and reasoning.

I have always been a stubborn person, even as a child. While my beliefs have evolved with my education and my understanding of life, my mulishness has not changed much. When I think of this and how earlier it started for me, one story comes to mind.

I was six years old and in first grade. At the time I was living with my mom, my little sister and my step-dad. One night we all sat around the dinner table and I gave my step-dad a note from my teacher. She explained that I was not doing well in math, that I was too preoccupied with doodling and drawing, and I was not focused on my work.

My step-dad began to lecture me on how I would need to be good at math to succeed in life. Of course I argued with him. I told him, “I don’t need math, I’m going to be an artist.”

He was incensed. His reply was to ask me how I was going to count the money I made from my art.

I looked at him in the eye and with a straight face said, “I’ll be rich. I’ll hire someone to do it for me.”

At that, I felt I’d won the argument because he was silent. He did not have a ready reply for my reasoning. Not to mention my mom doing her best, and failing, not to laugh.

As it turns out, he was right. Math is an important part of everyday life, and while I am a fairly accomplished artist I am by no means rich, so I cannot afford to pay anyone to count my money. Yet.
