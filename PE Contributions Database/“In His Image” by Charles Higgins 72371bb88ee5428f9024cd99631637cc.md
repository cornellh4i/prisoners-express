**“In His Image” by Charles Higgins**

The serene image of peace. The absolute quietness of the environment encapsulates my wild roaming mind. A touch of beauty far above the distant hills where clouds attempt to greet the dusk before the fall of twilight.

Alone on the calm waters of an eventful day that brought me here. A reflection off of the shimmering waters below, like a mirrored image beneath swallowed whole. A constant reminder of how deceiving looks can be, betrayed as it may seem...I’m not alone.

A higher power has been seen by my side, every wake of the day and breath of the night. As I remember with the picturesque reminder, so bold and full of life. I’m not by myself because a higher power brings truth to light.
