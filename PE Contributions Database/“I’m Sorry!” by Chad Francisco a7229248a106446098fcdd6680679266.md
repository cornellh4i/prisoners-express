**“I’m Sorry!” by Chad Francisco**

While reading the upcoming theme topics in my summer issue of “Prisoner Express”, one word stood out to me, and that was the word “sister.” You see, growing up in my house wasn’t always easy for me as a kid. I have an older brother who has always excelled at every sport he played. He even had his own wall dedicated to all his trophies. No matter how much I tried, I could never beat him at anything, let alone sports. Then there was my little sister, who was the baby of the three of us and on top of that, the only girl. Daddy’s little princess was a title made for her when we were kids. As the middle child with a severe case of middle child syndrome, I always felt inadequate compared to them. Unfortunately that led to a lot of anger in me and I only had a couple of places to aim it at.

At first I would try and point my anger towards my older brother, but with him being a boxer, it never ended well for me. So that left my sister! Let me first say I’m not proud of the shit bag brother I was to her and it is one of my biggest regrets. You see, she is three years younger than me and I was so jealous of her and all the attention she would get. So I used to pick on her and call her names that no one deserves to be called. If that wasn’t enough, I would even beat her up all the time. Not to the point of blood or black eyes, but enough to not only hurt her physically but also emotionally. The abuse seemed to go on for years and the more I got in trouble for it, the more upset I felt towards her.

Eventually, we got older and we spent so much time away from home, that we hardly saw each other. She lived her life and I lived mine, time flew by like ships passing in the night, and now we are both grown. Today I sit in prison and my sister is one of my biggest supporters. She always has my back and is there when I need her. She had a tough time growing up and I’m sure it was mostly my fault but I can say without a doubt that she is one of the toughest people I know. She is a single mother raising an amazing young man! These days she takes no shit from anybody! Though she still has to fight everyday, instead of fighting her brother she fights to be a great person and an even better mother! I tell you this because I can’t be prouder of my little sister. So when I see the word sister, it’s not just a word but a symbol of strength. Though I am taller than her it makes no difference, I will always look up to my little sister. From one shit bag brother to an amazing sister, I’m sorry and I love you!
