**Life’s Purpose by Raymond Springs II**

Peace and respect to all readers of this powerful build. Me and the God amazing was building the morning together, as I asked him; “what is Life’s Purpose?” Amazing’s reply was so profound that I am now inspired to share it with you. He is one of the true and living. He said, “the Purpose of Life is to leave this world in a better condition than it was in before you got here or was born, to help the planet and the people in it at every level whether it be to help them improve this game of chess or to become more responsible as a man. To contribute towards the planet's health, knowing our children and our children's children will inherit the planet in the condition that the generation before them had left it in”

Life’s purpose to me means Self Actualization as knowledge of Self. Self Knowledge is knowing who and what you are. Humans are the highest form of intelligence in physical form on this Planet. The Supreme Being of the known and knowable reality. The word Supreme is defined as: highest in rank or authority, highest in degree or quality, greatest or highest possible, ultimate, final.

Being is defined as: “a living thing, the most important or basic of a person’s mind or self.

Supreme being is defined as: “God. So I answer the question of what is Life’s Purpose, is to be God of the planet and as universes using one's power to build on positivity and to destroy the ignorance that is negative.
