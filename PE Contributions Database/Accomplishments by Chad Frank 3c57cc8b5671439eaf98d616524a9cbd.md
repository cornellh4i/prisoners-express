**Accomplishments by Chad Frank**

As a prisoner, too often I’m forced to dwell on my failures, so I was relieved to receive a chance to reflect on my accomplishments.

I came to prison when I was 22, so I didn’t accomplish much–especially considering that when I was in the “free world,” I was a captive dope, drink and desire. Busy chasing evasive pleasure, I had no time to pursue more meaningful goals. As sad as it may sound, it took coming to prison for me to accomplish anything worthwhile.

One of my lifelong dreams was to become a poet and writer. During the almost 15 years I’ve been down, I’ve published dozens of poems and prose pieces–many of which with prisoner express, which continues to be an invaluable resource. Most recently, I published my book The Death of Peter Pan: A Sex Offender’s Memoir on PrisonsFoundation.org. A 29-page excerpt also appears in Social Garbage: Throw-Away People, a collection of first-person narratives by sex-offender put out by Every Farthing Press and Percy Foundation. Why the change my name to “P.R.”, I don’t know–especially considering how I’ve always published under my own name. But it's an accomplishment nonetheless, considering hundreds of submissions were received and only a few dozen chosen for inclusion. This shows that my writing has merit. I’ve been told that The Death of Peter Pan is also indexed by Google Book and BoyWrite, which is part of the Free Spirits network of BL-related website that includes Boychat, which features prominently in the text. Obviously, my writing is getting attention	I’ve written two other memoirs and am compiling a collection of poems I’ve had published called Fading Innocence, which I hope to put out either through POD, traditional publishing, or in e-book format. How it gets distributed is not as important to me, so long as my writing gets read.

In addition to my poetry and writing, I’ve also been building a network of pen pals through services like Friends Beyond the Wall and Prison Inmates Online, which has been “interesting” to say the least.

My most important accomplishment is the fact that I’ve stayed relatively sane throughout this ordeal enduring experiences that many people would buckle under. If that’s not something to be proud of, then I don’t know what is...
