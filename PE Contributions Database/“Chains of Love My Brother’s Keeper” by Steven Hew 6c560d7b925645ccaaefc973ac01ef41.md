**“Chains of Love: My Brother’s Keeper” by Steven Hewitt**

“Hey Caleb, please wait. I can’t run anymore right now. I need to rest, and I’m so hungry.”

“Well, Josh come on we need to find some other place to rest. We can’t just stop right here in the street, someone will see us.”

“Caleb, I’m not concerned about whether anyone may see us. I mean, really, no one cares that much. Why would they? To them, we are nothing more than two nameless, invisible, faceless street kids that will never amount to anything.”

“You’re right Josh, but should we allow what is said by another influence us? People can say what they choose and nothing they call us matters. It’s nothing more than labels. Sure we may be homeless, poor, and alone, but we will not always be this way. Josh there are only two types of people in this world, those that are sheep and those that are lions. Sheep must be led, told what to do, told who they are, where to go, when to eat, and when to sleep. They can’t define themselves, they can only be that person they are told they are. They need a shepherd to quit their course of life. However, their shepherd may not always be a good one.

The other type is the lion. A lion knows who they are, where they are going and they fear nothing. No one can herd a lion.

When a lion roars people stop and listen, knowing he roars with a purpose. Josh I can’t help it, I’m a lion and one day this world will hear me roar little brother, and you will be right there with me.”

With the unfavorable circumstances Caleb and his little brother Josh must endure, most people would say that Caleb’s dream of rising above will never happen. Maybe it looks that way, but not to Caleb. For him there is only one way he can go, and that’s up.

Caleb and Josh know loneliness. Having no more than each other they search the streets and allies for a place to belong, but they find nothing that can hold Caleb’s ideal of the life he will one day have. He will not settle for anything less. Caleb must one day roar.

Caleb can not relate with others that define who they are based on whether they have lots of money or how much they own, or some title they received.

A lion is a lion. Nothing can be added to or taken away that could cause a lion not to be a lion. They need nothing and by doing so have everything.

Caleb and Josh do not know how it is to lose everything they own or have who they are take away when all is lost. For that to happen to them, they must first have something to lose. They have no family, no mother to comfort them, to hold them tight during these long dark nights. No father to protect them, to show them how to walk the path that has no light. To lift them up when they trip and fall over the labels set before them by others. To uncover the seed of doubt that lurks in the dark place, less it take root in their hearts and choke on the faith needed to lift their lives out of the clutches of defeat into the light where they will learn to roar.

How will these two kids break free from the chains they were born with clamped tight around their lives? They will embrace them for what they are.

These chains are the only gift their parents left to them. Their parents were born with the same chains. However, Caleb and Josh, unlike their parents, see their chains not as a device to hold them down, chained to a life of suffering, but as a gift binding them together, giving them a constant reminder that nothing can ever pull them apart. That no matter where life will take them, they will be there together. With their hearts and minds chained together, Caleb and Josh will take that which was meant to oppress them, the very tool designed to destroy any chance of having a life, a chance to rise above their circumstances and soar.

Standing tall, they look at fate straight in the face, and smile, removing the dark veils that covered their faces. The dense coverings that made their faces invisible to the world around them. The eyeless mask that kept them out of sight, out of mind, to the world around them. A world where those that have it all, also have so much to lose.

Caleb and Josh discovered a secret. How it’s not a misfortune not to have many possessions if they are not used to define who you are, or cause you to suffer if they are taken from you. They are a wonderful gift.

To them the most wonderful, most valuable possession they have, or could ever want is their unconditional love for one another. The comfort in knowing that no matter how high they one day rise in this world and even if everything they accomplish is taken away, the chains of love will still bind them together. Knowing that when you start with nothing, you end up with everything.

Josh, I promise you will look back on this day. The day when we have nothing but each other and are thankful. For what could not hold us down made us stronger. String enough that we could rise up and roar. We are our brother's keeper.
