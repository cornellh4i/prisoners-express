**Stars by Rudy Djordjevich**

It has been one thousand one hundred and twenty-six days since I have seen the stars in the night sky. I mean, really seen them, not a foggy, blurred-out version I get through the thick, murky, and time-riddled plexiglas that surrounds my window and obstructs my chance at ever reminding myself that there is more in this world beyond this twisted construction of brick and mortar that consumes my physical body and taints my mentality.

The awe-inspiring moment happened at around 9 P.M. count. “Right after count,” the corrections officer told me as he checks my name off on his list, “get in compliance and wait by the door for legal mail.”

Here, we have to go to the squad room for our legal mail, which is a good thing because it is 9:30 and the sun has been down for a while. So I will get a chance at some night time fresh air. I have not been out at night in so long; we only get rec. during the daylight hours.

I got dressed and waited. The sergeant called and told the correction officer he is ready for me. The door gets buzzed open, and I head out.

The cold air struck me like I just entered the vacuums of space. I clenched my muscles tightly and crossed my arms for more warmth. The night wasn’t windy; it was actually very still, but the sky was cloudless. The stars glistened with such vibrant contrast like Christmas lights on a festive evergreen. The moon was so big and bright that it was like a spotlight that was focused on me to guide my way.

I felt like an astronaut that just exited his module and made his first step on a martian planet never explored by mankind. This must have been what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin felt when they landed on the moon. Every star and nebula they have seen seem to be completely different ones.

I have seen the stars before, but now I was miles out in the country. Here I could see them much better than back when the city lights of my hometown interfered with the visibility of this magical world above. I searched the constellation for Orion and looked at the three stars along his belt. Those stars are in perfect alignment with the pyramids of Giza in Egypt. I imagine to myself that I am in Giza right then, looking at the stars that inspired such a marvel of the world.

Just by staring at the stars, I could take a quantum leap of sorts to any destination in the universe. An out of body experience better than any Tryptamine could offer. I was soaring on Haley’s comet, jumping out, and taking a dip in the oceans of the Jovian satellites of Europa. Swimming in the strange chemistry of the planet and the exotic species that inhabit it, I took a sip of the fluids that overflow out of the Big Dipper. I danced to the percussion beat of the pulsars and figure skated on the ice rings of Saturn.

At that moment, I was the astro-median that could look centuries into the past. I could bask in the wonders of the cosmos, roast marshmallows off the thermic rays emitting off of the star, breathe in the diatomic gas from the atmosphere that surrounds me, and watch the quasar light show.

As my mind drifted off, my body was discovered back on the walk. I was paralyzed from the stars and pulled 3,670 million miles back to earth by the sergeant yelling at me for being out in the walk for so long. He took my DOC number and said that he was going to write me up on an Out of Place #366 for staying out too long and making them go look for me. I can’t be mad because if they only knew how far I escaped that time, he would have thrown me in the SHU.

I went back to the unit and made up my mind that I would never take the wonder of the universe for granted again. I will travel to the desolate deserts of Arizona with a sleeping bag and telescope and take that wonderful exploration through the Dark Matter of space again. Allow the stars to light my way.
