**“All Cats are Grey in the Dark” by Catherine LaFleur**

Here at Camp Prisoney Land, there is a lot of activity at night in the cat sanctuary. Some of the activity is legitimate such as the midnight trash collection. An activity everyone fights for the chance to do since the officers’ goodie laden trash must be kept separate from the general inmate trash items. Other, more clandestine types of Activity happen late at night. I really don’t want to have any knowledge of it until it is absolutely necessary for me to know, like when I am writing the appeal of your disciplinary report for sex acts/unauthorized physical contact. Even though I live a rather solitary and contemplative existence, I am not a prude. There were some things about marriage that I really, really enjoyed. I am a normal human being and over the years, there have been (ahem) self indulgences. In fact, the other day someone passed me a novel so filthy I was shocked and appalled...which is why I had to read it twice. I just don’t want to actually hear anything, see anything, or smell anything.

Nowadays, for health reasons, I must drink a lot of water every day. I have, consequently, received the gift of the bladder alarm clock. This delightful accoutrement awakens me throughout the night, necessitating a trip from my cell on the second tier to the communal bathroom.

Generally, that is when I see things I have no business seeing. I don’t want to know who is cheating with whom in the wee hours of the morning. So I pretend to see nothing. I also don’t want to know anything about why Officer Handsy is emerging from your cell door tucking in his all together and zipping up. Compounding the problem is that all of this activity is on camera. Which means, if the camera footage is inspected for any reason, it will show I am an eyewitness to said events. A certain kind of officer might think I would need some physical encouragement to keep my mouth shut. Do I need such harassment? No. Thank you, but no.

For this reason my past policy has been to leave my spectacles on the side of my bed when taking my night-time potty breaks. Being nearsighted, without my glasses everyone looks like colored blobs. Unfortunately, without my eyes, I tripped over something another inmate left on the walkway and did the involuntary splits at 2 a.m. one morning. Although I am an adherent of yoga, that and the accompanying late-night shriek must never be allowed to happen again.

Some officers I hope never to see entering into or emerging from transactional nighttime cell activity. You know the kind I mean. They are the ones who like women as people and treat and speak to us accordingly. I can tell they have good relationships with the women in their lives; mothers, sisters, aunts, maybe even friends. But Camp Prisoney Land has an infinite variety of adorable fawning cats, who are amenable to almost any proposal. Really beautiful show-worthy cats. Or really kinked up cats. Or Jimmy Hendrix cats who miaou ‘are you experienced… do you wanna be’? No matter an officer’s outside life situation, it is very difficult for them to turn down such a selection. Both the boys and the girls.

So, there I was at 2:00 a.m. in the morning on my way to the bathroom when Officer Virile stepped out of the cell door immediately into my path. Oh no, I thought, not you too! He just stood there blocking the way. I stopped short and cast my eyes first down at the floor, then up at the ceiling. Finally, I held up the toilet paper. He stepped back slightly into the cell he had just evacuated so I could pass. I averted my gaze, making no eye contact. Just like Gary Oldman in *Dracula*, I waved my hand in front of Virile’s face as I passed by and chanted ‘do not see me’.

Later that morning, after waking early for my walk to medical for morning blood pressure checks, I was waiting for the Laundry room directly in front of the officer’s station. A very large full plastic bag filled with the dorm’s trash awaited pick up by the morning disposal crew. Officer Virile comes barreling out of the doof and flings a small trash bag from his office at me. I reflexively caught it. He demanded I empty his trash into the dormitory’s trash bag. That’s when I looked him straight in the eye and handed the back back, “Sorry, Officer Trash cannot mix with Inmate Trash.”
