****They say we should face our fears, though some are a little more scarier than others. Some people spend their whole life facing their fear, while others spend most of theirs running from theirs. But as for me, I’m having to face my fear whether I want to or not. Life has put me in a place where a turn of events have led up to me facing my worst fears of all.

I sit in what we call a day room, and I put in headphones in my ears with the music loud to block out the yelling and laughing all around, and the cards slamming on the table. Most long times in this dorm got their own seat where they sit all the time. So I’m sitting in my everyday seat, thinking about what my sister is doing and how her kids are doing. Then it hits me that I’m pretty much alone in this world, out of sight and out of mind. My uncle would say that, and he did 21 years in Tennessee prison and always tried to get me to calm my act down. But with my Mother gone and how my wife passes as well, it’s only a matter of time, if not already, that I’m “forgotten.” What have I done to leave my mark on this earth?

This feeling is the one fear that I’ve ran from since my Mother died in my arms. Funny thing is feelings affect not just how we think but our habits too, since it feels like even if I get out, I won’t have anyone or anything. So I keep busy trying not to think about it. Though I’ve still got family not really around, it’s started to settle in my worst fear of dying alone and not being remembered.

So in 8.5 years from now, I’m working on it, and to my shock, being alone has kind of got its positive ways to look at this. New start, a goal to make my mark here on this earth and not something that hurts others. As I write this, I hope it has helped someone. First mark is fixing my wrongs, and the second mark is helping others. Then I move toward drawing so much because I want to be a great artist, a one of a kind and remembered person. I guess that the same reason I write is to be remembered, but now, no matter what happens to my goals and plans, one thing is for sure. I’ll have faced my fears!
