**by Benjamin Rivera**

The concept of finding oneself is foreign to me. I truly don’t understand when someone says, “I had to find myself” or “I found myself.” My thing is “how did I get lost in the first place, to have to find myself. Did I veer off the road, Did I take a left when I should’ve took a right? Maybe I should’ve invested in a GPS so that way I would never lose myself to begin with.”

Imagine being born with a GPS or let's call it LPS (Life Positioning System) so that no matter what road in life you take, you could never get lost. It would be perfect right? Always on the right road. You know what? Perfection isn’t for me. I like to take the road less travelled. Off road if you will. I find that whether you travel on the right or the wrong path, you always build character, or what some would call “starting your journey on finding oneself.” So if getting lost means that it helps me become who I am in the process of finding my way, then I will always be lost because I am always finding a way to be a better man.
