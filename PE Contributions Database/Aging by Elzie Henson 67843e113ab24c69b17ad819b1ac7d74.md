**"Aging" by Elzie Henson**

What is aging? The change in a thing or someone that causes their appearance to look young or older. How can you tell how old a tree is? By counting its rings. Aging is a process by which the mind and body change for the worst. Our mind leaves us, as we grow old, our heart beat slower as we age. Our skin turns colors in the process of aging. The cells in our eyes turn red and even darker the older we get. A simple way of aging as to losing your youth being locked up in a prison away from your ones and family. Also with aging you grow more physically, mentally, and spiritually. You're never too old to learn. I've been locked-up for 10 years and the aging process has taken its toll on my back, my knees, my vision all in all these are the dramatic changes we go through in the life of aging. Whether it's to be young and come to learn knowledge and wisdom. Starting with nothing and learn to create the older we get and more we grow, the more we learn to do it and when. Like paint that's been on a house for a long period of time it begins to wither and peel. The skin on our body, the older we get begins to slack and wrinkle. As for aging it has a tendency to make some look older than they are. This subject of aging makes me think of other topics as well. How about decisions, making choices, and learning? Just a few topics to keep in mind while we write on these other topics. Aging, what is it? The challenge of change on someone or something.
