Fitting in- also known as adjusting to life and to the circumstances that we find ourselves in. I have great admiration for those that are actually able to accomplish this most basic of life's little necessities...because I have never been able to.

We've all heard the old saying "get in where you fit in" -- but, what if you don't fit in -- you can't get in, right? Which leaves one standing outside, both literally and figuratively -- so you fit in with the outsiders -- a 2nd rate destiny maybe, but for those with the inner strength to tolerate that destiny, still not that bad...at least you found a slot that you fit into.

Unfortunately, I don't possess that strength. I had to find a 10th or 12th (or maybe 100th) rate destiny! Looking for somewhere to fit in stopped working for me, so I went in search of the bottom ... those in search of the bottom always find it -- after all, its always there, isn't it?!

Greetings from the bottom! Wanna know the really sad part?I don't "fit in" here either!
