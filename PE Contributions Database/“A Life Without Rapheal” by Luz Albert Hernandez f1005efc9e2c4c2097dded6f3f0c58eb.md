**“A Life Without Raphael” by Luz Albert Hernandez**

“Did I make the right decision?” was all Aries could think of as she gazed out at the monstrous skyscrapers erected like giant tombstones. “I miss him so much,” she thought as memories of him swayed in and out of her mind.

“You are my wish on a star, mi todo, remember love conquers all,” he had written on his last letter to her from behind the bars of a hazy jail cell with walls, whose paint had peeled off caused by time and neglect. At least, that’s how she imagined it. Raphael had never described the “inside” to her. But even the paper he wrote his eternal thoughts on reeked of staleness and expiration.

When Aries would go visit him in the county jail, it was always gloomy and had ugly yellow lights like the flesh of a rotting corpse washed up onshore. The glass window they were forced to adore each other through nearly framed his face perfectly; it was so small. In those days, twenty minutes, which is all they were allowed twice a week, seemed like forever. Those twenty minutes were enough for her to face the world and all its evils. But she was only so strong and only nineteen.

She had lied to herself when it first started to feel like a burden to get up and go see him, to take the time to write him a letter that flowed over several pages. Then, she met Brandon and told herself that he reminded her of Raphael and it was nothing more than a fling. “How did a fling end up a marriage?” she questioned herself.

They ran off to Vegas to get married. That was two days ago. In the morning, they would leave for home in Texas. She glanced back at Brandon and his naked body gleamed in the many lights of the city. She thought of the night of their matrimony and the sex afterwards. It never felt so exhilarating in her life. She was looking out at Vegas in all its glory as bright as the throne room of God, and that caused her nerves to jump and her blood to rush.

Then she thought of what Raphael might be doing at the moment. She didn’t know if he was still in county jail or prison. After she received the news of his massive sentence, she believed he never would get out from under those dead yellow lights.

“Raphael,” she whispered as a tear rolled off her eye. She remembered the last time she was with him.

“I have to go to work,” Raphael pleaded with her.

“No, take a nap with me first,” she cooed at him.

“No, baby, I have to go,” he answered.

“Baby, no! Take a nap with me.” She pouted and made her face because she knew he would fall for it. Raphael stood next to the front door of their one-bedroom apartment in his worn-out boots, old jeans, and muscle shirt that hung loosely off his shoulders because he had stopped working out once they had moved in together. When they were together, they remained in each other’s arms. There was no reason to do anything else.

“Alright, a quick nap, then I have to go,” he said as he gave in.

“Carry me,” she pleaded, and she stuck her arms out. He scooped her off the couch and she wrapped her arms around his neck. He carried her into the bedroom and laid her down on the bed.

“Happy now?” he asked sarcastically. She just nodded and grinned.

“Oh, you think that’s funny?” he said as he feigned anger and began to caress her with his tongue. She giggled and hugged him. The last thing she saw before she fell asleep was his brown eyes and messed up hair. The first thing she heard when she awoke to a bang on the door was, “Open up, POLICE DEPARTMENT!”

Another tear rolled, reflecting the lights of Vegas and her new life. A life without Raphael.
