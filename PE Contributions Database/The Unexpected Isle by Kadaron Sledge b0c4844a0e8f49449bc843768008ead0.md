**"The Unexpected Isle" by Kadaron Sledge**

They called him preacher. His message never changed: Death respects no one. It is closer than you think; accept Jesus now.

Anna and Parmigiano, Italian newlyweds, heeded him not as Preacher released his moorings.

Life is new. Barely beginning for them. The future is as expansive as the sea they sail. Anna-hanging off the front, a figurehead- brown hair catching fire in golden sunlight and rushing winds.

No agendas. No destination. However, they arrived, often once during breakfast, twice in the early afternoon, and once again before the Mediterranean sunset.

It is Anna who spots the island in the morning's dawn. No bigger than a turtle's shell, Anna teases it. They anchor offshore; swimming Adam and Eve: naked and unashamed.

Anna is first to shore. Parmigiano admiring her wet form. The saltwater reluctant to release its caress.

Eager to create their first child on this unexpected and uncharted isle, she drags her husband into the stone hut sitting atop it's miniature hill. The hut's door long since rotted off. Wood raftered roof splintered and dilapidated, giving peeks at shivering leaves in the two-tree canopy above them. But there is no uncomfortable place for young lovers to arrive. Arrive. And arrive again.

Giano, as she calls him, awakens, amazed at the dimness visible through the ceiling holes. They must've slept dawn to dusk. He tickles his wife awake in unmentionable ways.

The trees above seem to revive with them. Odd, no wind can be heard whistling. Out the front door, boney branches scar the view of sea and vessel, dancing hypnotically. The sun is bright beyond the limbs. The tree limbs must have shifted, causing spooky darkness.

The bride and groom shrug it off.

Surgically sutured to Giano's side, Anna is led docilely into the air. A seagull shrieks. A thousand hands grab a hundred of their body parts, snatching them airborne. Leaves and vines cling and rip at them. Anna's legs (her arms are pinned), and Giano's arms, desperately grip the other lover.

He screams her name, foliage swarms his open mouth, piercing his fleshy cheeks, stabbing up his nostrils, crawling for his brain.

Anna screams for him.as his true love, she could not hold her tongue. She screams and wonâ€™t be stopped. Not as vine upon vine slithers snuggly around her neck.

Mercifully, broad leaves scratch out Parmigiano's eyes.

Snap! Her yells go silent.

His ears know: they broke her neck.

The agony of acid slowly dissolves into his blistering skin-quicker than his suffocation. We are being digested, eaten like flies in a web, he thinks.

As his brain dims, he begins to hear the voices in the woods. Souls hundreds of years old, trapped, screaming, tortured, still being feasted on. And now, they are here to join them.
