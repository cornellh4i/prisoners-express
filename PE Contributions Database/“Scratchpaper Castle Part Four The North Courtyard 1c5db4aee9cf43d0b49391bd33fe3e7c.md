**“Scratchpaper Castle Part Four: The North Courtyard” by Matthew Tomlinson**

Welcome! Welcome into my Scratchpaper Castle! Hopefully you enjoyed the train ride that brought your imagination here. Come into my Scratchpaper Castle through the North Gate here. Here’s a small fountain with a set of conversation benches. This is one of my favorite places to sit, this North Courtyard. We’ll start your tour with a brief chat. Yes, it has to be brief because Prisoner Express has a 750 word limit. That’s plenty of space for a brief chat. Prisoner Express allowed me to overstep my bounds with 1000 words for “Part One: Railroad by Prisoner Express Photos.” 33% overage! What a conversation that chat became, huh? They allowed me to again exceed my allotment with 835 words for “Part Two: Introducing Locomotive Six-Six-Six”. 11% overage was less abusive of my privileges. It only took 773 words to describe “Part Three: The Interspatial Zone”, only three percent overage. I’m getting better but there’s so much to tell you!

There are eight hours in every one of the five working days of a freeworld workweek. What work would you choose to do for forty hours per workweek, if you had no work that must be done? If you could choose whatever you like to occupy yourself all day every day, then what would you choose?

In prison, you have 168 hours per week of free time if you choose that. I’m single-celled in administrative segregation. All of the remains of my 99 year sentence will be free time. My keepers provide free shelter in an 8 feet x 5 feet windowless cell. Utilities, central heat and air conditioning and maintenance are included with the rent. My keepers provide a rough average of three meals per day. The unit is on lockdown for some reason, so meals have been Johnny Bags these past three weeks plus four days. Supper was a weenie on rye along with a peanut butter sandwich on white bread. It’s free food. My keepers provide free clothing that never goes out of style. With free shelter, free food and free clothing, all of my basic human needs are met.

I chose to spend my time building a castle. At least, its my idea of what a castle ought to be, built my way, on my schedule. Scratchpaper Castle will be shown to you as a series of hallways. They might interconnect. They might not. Loco-motive Six-Six-Six pulled, well now! Congratulations on your ability to observe! Yes, Loco-motive Six-Six-Six pulled several of my stories into the Scratchpaper Castle station. My set of stories on “The Red Unicorn” made two railcars. My stories on “The Trinity Project” made three additional railcars. One car carried “Auxiliary F.B.I.: Faith Based Initiative” into Scratchpaper Castle station. You get the idea. Each of the 44 products printed in Prisoner Express so far is a hallway of my Scratchpaper Castle. Then the 19 more products submitted to Prisoner Express but not yet printed will become hallways in Scratchpaper Castle upon publication. The 11 railcars that are bad orders will be repaired, on my schedule, as parts become available for each railcar.

What will you, Reader, build? How many hallways will your castle have? How can you get into the minds of fellow Prisoner Express addicts like Scratchpaper Castle got into your mind?

Loco-Motive Six-Six-Six does bring you to Scratchpaper Castle. It doesn’t take you back. You never have to worry about catching the train to get home. There’s a much simpler process for that. Notice something about the fountains. They’re pretty but they’re only fountains such as you see on Terra. Dip your hand, then bring a palmful of water water to your mouth as if you’d drink it. Notice how the water glimmers, shines and almost seems to be alive with changing colors? Notice the water in the fountain doesn’t do that? It’s your touch that causes the Rainbow Fountain to show its true colors. Likewise it’s your touch that will make your contributions to Prisoner Express glitter, sparkle and glisten. Now sip that palmful of water from the Rainbow Fountain.

I awoke clear-headed from my nap. My left hip was mildly protesting the position on the concrete under the Airline Drive overpass. I rose, stretched the kinks, then picked up my still-cool Dr. Pepper. My stroll back to The Shack gave me time to put the puzzle pieces in their places. My obligation had been fulfilled. I’d ridden the train, as was my duty. But what, if anything more than you’ve read was I expected to have brought back from Scratchpaper Castle? Then what was I expected to do with whatever I had brought back?

Mail had been delivered at The Shack. A manila envelope with my name and address block-printed in blue marker awaited. In the return address was a smiley face drawn in pink marker. Pink and blue was about to give me answers. Unwanted answers
