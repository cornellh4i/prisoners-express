**Life’s Purpose by Paul Pommells**

My concept of Life's Purpose was influenced by my reading of Viktor Frankl's Man’s Search for Meaning. I believe my purpose is to use my gifts from the Creator to have a positive impact through all the roles that I play and in the important relationships in my life. That is my general answer and it is true, but sometimes life calls us to fulfill a special purpose.

We are living in an age of rampant moral decline and opiates. I see evidence of decline everyday in my role as a mentor/peer counselor in a prison Substance Abuse Treatment Program. I also see evidence of decline throughout prison.

It is in my heart to be a nurturer and a protector so when I see evidence of growing human decline I want to speak up. I want to challenge the men around me to be men: to really think about what it really means to respect themselves. I care so I want to challenge them to make their lives better.

I think my purpose is to do what I’m doing. I believe wholeheartedly in recovery. You would think that recovery would be an easy message to preach in prison, but the field is filled with hurt men who favor denial over progress.

I care so much that I get disappointed at times, but not enough to quit. You could say that I have faith. It is the faith that I am serving my purpose which gives me strength to overcome the tests that litter my way.
