**“Serenity” by David Williams**

This is serenity to me. This is a place where there is complete stillness of the waters and mountains on top of the sea. I see two eyes in the sea, one to the left and one to the right of this board. I say to myself, “These have to be the eyes of the Lord.” I feel blessed at this very moment because seeing the Lord’s eyes means that I will not stop. Having good faith, that is, while I reach that fourth mountain top. Can you see it in the distance? It’s easy for me, because these are the four mountains that represent “L-O-V-E”. With these mountains, I am already “free”. Remember that I said in the beginning, “This is serenity to me”.
