***Get a Haircut* by George Dominguez**

My mom used to tell me that when I was little, my dad would pull out the clippers to cut my brothers’ and my hair, and that I’d run and hide. My dad was a barber and knew how to cut hair, but I still didn’t want my hair cut. I didn’t like it short, and when I got locked up at 25, they cut my hair. I’d sometimes think way back when my Dad would cut my hair. Once when my parents came to see me, I told my dad that when these people tell me I need a haircut, I think of him.

When I got out, I started to let my hair grow long again, but when I went back, I decided to cut it all off because I was sick of people telling me to cut it. My boss I worked for in prison would call me Mini Me from Austin Powers. When my parole officer asked me why I cut my hair, I told him that I was sick of the officers telling me I needed a cut. Best believe I’m going to leave it off.
