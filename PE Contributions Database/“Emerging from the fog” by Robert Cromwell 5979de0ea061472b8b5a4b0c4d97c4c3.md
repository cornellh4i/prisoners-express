**“Emerging from the fog”** by Robert Cromwell

I’m walking, but the fog is so thick, I trip, I slip, I bump into things I cannot see. The fog is too thick, what is happening to me?

The fog of disillusionment and despair often creeps up on us and if we were not careful, it can and will overtake us. It comes in small, simple, and subtle steps that we don’t seem to notice and so we continue on further and deeper into the fog. It is so subtle that our own eyes adjust to it and we feel this is normal, this is how the world is now. We can’t see very far and dangers and pitfalls are all about.

Be careful! Be wary! Watch your step! For if you don’t you may fall and not get back up. You’re blind now, you’ve gone too far, the trap has sprung and your stuck inside. What happened? How did I let myself get to this point? I ignored the signs, the voices, and the calls and only realized after the trips and falls.

It is here when the truth is revealed, where you see who is true and what is real. The fog starts to shift and to clear a little at a time and you come to understand that all will be fine. See the world for what it is, the sun, the beauty of nature, and the fresh air.

Don’t limit yourself, you can be what you will. Possibilities abound, see what works best for you. Emerge from you stupor that has kept you bound, release the disillusionment and despair and take a deep breath of the new day and fresh air. Emerge from the fog and take a look around, this is how the world truly looks and what awaits return.

Lessons learned from our own mistakes, we learn, we study, and we grow. Use the time wisely, for we reap what we sow.
