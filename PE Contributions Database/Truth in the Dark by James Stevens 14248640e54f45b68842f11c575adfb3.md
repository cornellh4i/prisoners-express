**Truth in the Dark by James Stevens**

Renee couldn’t fight the small on her face, she was finally here! Four long years of planning her class schedules, clubs, summer intern jobs all led to this. The Jefferson School of Business only took thirty-two kids a year on Scholarships. She even got pledged to the Lamda Lamda Chi sorority.

This pledge party was hopping. Renee was enjoying it a little too much and needed a breather. She found one of the empty bedrooms and sat on the bed. The music thumped faintly from downstairs. She just needed to sit a minute and gather her wits.

She heard footsteps coming down the hall. Holding her breath, she listened. Pledges weren’t supposed to be upstairs. Voices were on the other side of the door. Renee panicked. What to do? She spotted a closet and just got the closet door closed as the other opened.

Renee peaked through the slats in the door. It was her pledge master Rose and the head of the sorority, Katherine, she thought. They closed the door and sat on the bed,

“So,” Katherine said. “ How many charity cases do we have this year?”

“Two,” replied Rose. “That blond chick Tiffany and my pledge Renee.” Renee froze - they were talking about her. “It sucks that the heads at Lamda Lamda Chi make us do this!”

Katherine shifted on the bed. “Now, now Rose. We must keep up an image. If we don’t include a few of the lower class people then we might present the wrong image. So tell me about yours.”

“Her name is Renee May Johnson. This must be her dream to get out of poverty or the sticks. She may even be the first to go to college. Anyways, she’s taken every business elective possible. She interned with several important businesses in her state. If it wasn’t that she was from lower stock she may have been our poster child to the path to business greatness. I guess to keep our image we have to allow her into the sorority.”

“I agree. I’ll check with Tiffany’s sponsor and see about her, but I agree. This Renee can be our pet project. Everyone loves a success story. You and I will be able to show how we moulded a grub into a darling.”

“Ok, I’ll go find my pledge and introduce her to the crew. We can fill them in on those two tonight.” Rose stood up. “I’m off, tata.” Katherine touched up her makeup and followed.

Renee stood in silent shock for quite a while. Tears crept down her face. A charity case? That’s who these people are? She thought. She chose this sorority because it was an elite business sorority. Now she saw, really saw what this sorority stood for.

She looked at her watch. 2:30, she still had time. She was also invited to the Beta Kappa Kappa sorority pledge party. It wasn’t as prestigious as this one, but she had met a lot of girls from that sorority. They seemed more genuine.

With her mind made up, she wiped her tears on a dress that no doubt cost more than her little Volkswagen Golf. Straightening her spine, she opened the closet door, leaving it open. She left the room. Each step down fueled her anger. It was ready to burst as she reached the first floor.

“Renee! There you are.” Rose said, putting an arm around her shoulder. “ I have some girls I want to introduce you to.” Renee grabbed Rose’s arm off her shoulder. Rose looked at her clearly not understanding the gesture. Instead of speaking, she spotted Tiffany, the other “charity pledge. ” She walked over and whispered into Tiffany’s ear.

TIffany’s face went through many stages, annoyance, shock, and anger. She nodded and they hooked arms and went for the front door.

“Renee, Tiffany what’s going on?” Katherine stood beside Rose. “We were just looking for you two. We have good news. Now keep this between just us girls, but, you’re both in! Isn’t that great!”

Tiffany threw her drink at Katherine. The shocked look on their faces was priceless.

Renee looked at both girls “I worked my whole life planning on this day. I thought I needed the right classes. The right sorority to make it. Now that I’m here I see how wrong I was at this sorority. I have an education, pride, integrity, and skills.” Renee looked around after the splash of the drink and the place went silent. “I see the falsehoods here. Most of you are riding on mommy and daddy’s fame and money. It takes a lot more than mommy and daddy to be successful in business. After your little pep talk in your room, which I overheard, I realized that you two especially are nothing but two rich bitches who have no concept of the real world.”

“Tiffany and I come from a different class. Sure, we don’t have your parents’ money or influence, but we have everything we own by hardwork and determination. Tiffany, let’s go find us a better class of losers!” They walked out of the door.
