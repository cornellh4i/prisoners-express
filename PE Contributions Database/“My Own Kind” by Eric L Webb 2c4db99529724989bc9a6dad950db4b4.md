**“My Own Kind” by Eric L. Webb**

In a world so primitive as to adhere to the preconceived delusions of sticking with “your own kind”... I dare to be different.

What’s up! Ummm, I’m Eric and I guess I was born a fox. Unfortunately, I’m not in the forest where I believe I belong right now, I broke the code of laws in my hometown and some wild ass federal fox hunters came and scooped me right up out of my “den” and uhhh...put me in the “pen.” And this place sucks prrrrreet-tee bad. Movie horror shows confirmed it’s super divided in here! Foxes perch over there. Geese flock over there. Turtles swim over there, that’s their “spot” and don’t you dare go over there and mingle lest a war between foxes and turtles kick, bite, and snap off!

...But would it really be out of pocket if I said, “Is it really against Mother Nature if I’ve never been a fox to judge and compartmentalize other living beings based on stereotyping?”

After all, not all white geese play golf and watch NASCAR , drink peer and smack their wives in shabby makeshift trailer parks. And not all turtles are ninjas. And not all foxes listen to Jimi Hendrix. But in here a lot of my fellow foxes are up in arms because I dare (how dare I do such a thing!) to be cool with any living being...as long as they have a good character. My friend Julius is a goose. A goose with one leg coincidentally, so I help him out by rolling him around town sometimes.

Rolling Julius past the penitentiary grocery store, my “own kind” give me crazy looks. But deep down I know they just don’t get it. Besides, Julius is cool and I’d rather spend my time with fly people vs. fox of the non-existent reich supremacists, who in all actuality are not even really foxy supremacists but merely blending into the mold of the preconceived “code” of ignorance and adjoining hoopty-doopty that’s been pervading these places since 1932 something or other era of nincompoopery.

...Are we not all from the same fabric of the universe, the same stars of unified purpose, the same magma of life that erupted into the surface of this world a long, long time ago? Don’t we all live on Earth and ultimately depend on one another for mutual survival if we are to explore the galaxies and live forever in this mortal reality? Don’t we all have the same mother, the very same beginning and pulse of Purpose and destiny? Who has time for quarrelling with his brothers and sisters over such a thing as fur color and goosy territory and stereotypes? Does that seem like a “superior” and “intelligent” thing to do?

But God help them all, nobody can understand or comprehend this little pea of knowledge rattling around in my little fox brain. Some of my fox people think they and I should be “better” than geese like my brother Julius. They sit over there at “that” table (like high school) gossiping on the late neuron morsels of “foxy Superiority” and “furry domination.” But the truth is, I don’t want to conquer anyone BUT MYSELF. And I did, at least to the point where I realized the psychological thinking errors of my own primordial stupidity and the overall insignificance of my genetic fur tone in the face of the entire universe! I realized I...just like all things...are stars. Born out of pure impossibility at the very beginning of all time. I realized that we are all beings of life and creation and my true “family” is all things and living beings. So I push my brother Julius. Not because I’m “trying to be a goose” but because I move with a Higher Purpose. I kick it with him out of Universal Oneness, not ignorance simply because he’s “a goose” who quacks and has an orange beak, like some of his friends do. Limit my “own kind” to simply foxes? Hahaha, what a crime that’d be!

Me and my homeslice Julian lean on each other. He’s the funniest goose alive and keeps me quacking up. And my only skill as a fox is not merely limited to pushing a cart with my “G” in it, I also tattoo and Julius is dying to get his one remaining limb and foot done with some bad-freaking-ass Japanese traditional. I got you Daniel-son, I got you.
