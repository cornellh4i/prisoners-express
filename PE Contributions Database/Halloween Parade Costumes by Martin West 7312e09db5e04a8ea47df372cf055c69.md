**"Halloween Parade Costumes" by Martin West**

How many of you as readers remember your grade school Halloween costumes from kindergarten through fifth grade? If you have reached 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, or older, can you still recall vivid details of each costume?

So please join me as we travel back in time to relive some of my fondest memories in my childhood. All through school I was teased, hazed, or bullied by my fellow classmates. The only time I stood on equal ground or above the bullies was during Halloween Parade Costume judging. Each judge looked for costumes with creativity, originality, and uniqueness. My costumes were always homemade, and both parents cooperated together to complete my costumes. My mother was a homemaker during my school years and gladly volunteered as Room Mother and substitute teacher. Most years, I won first, second, or third prize.

During my kindergarten 1968 year, my mother chose to create a custom fitted Indian headband, fringe top, fringe pants, and leather belt. We found moccasins to fit my size at a family-owned shoe store. She found the McCalls pattern for my Indian outfit at out local TG&4 Store. I loved the colorful feathers she used in my wrap around headband. I remember having my face and neck painted, and I got to wear my moccasins without socks. It took several fittings, as I was always growing in spurts.

By 1969, my first grade year, Bill Hanna and Joe Barbara had premiered many new Saturday morning cartoon shows. One of them gave us my next costume idea: The Jetsons. I was going to be “El Roy Jetson” walking his dog Astro. She made me a neon pajama pull-string sweat bottom and a blue and green striped long sleeve v-neck pajama top. Dad helped create the beanie hat. We used a stuffed dog and leash with a collar to give me the props to walk my dog.

For second grade in 1970, my costume was made from recycled materials. I became Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. One big box for my shoulders to fit through and one box for the head with eye slits, mouth opening, and a red ball clown nose, and a white string collar to hold my tin can bell. My father spray-painted the boxes brown and the eyes black. I wore a brown short sleeve shirt, brown slacks, brown socks, and brown shoes. It was a hot costume to be standing still in because once the heat in the gym where the parade took place turned on, there were few ventilation fans running to circulate air. My antlers were cardboard with hanger wire to keep them from flopping over when on the move.

As a tall gangly kid, lacking motor coordination and being a klutz made me an excellent choice to take my shot at playing Frankenstein’s creation of a pieced-together human male. So in 1971, my third grade year, my costume came from our local Salvation Army Thrift store. The ensemble included: a man’s dark colored suit jacket, a man’s long sleeve shirt, work pants, belt, and lace-up boots. To add effect, my mother randomly ripped and tore patches in the jacket and added fake blood and spider webbing. There were small holes and stains in the pants already, so none needed to be added. A front green facemask added the finishing touches. I had to wear two pairs of tube socks on each foot to keep from slipping out of the oversized boots. I practiced for several days how to do stiff walking gait with my complete costume. During the parade walk, I added sound effects: moaning, groaning, and grunting.

My mother was a bargain shopper, so when Halloween supplies went on sale on November 1st, 1971, she found me one old male front mask and one grey wig. I had grown up so much during my fourth-grade year in 1972 that I was able to wear my Father’s work pants, a gardening long sleeve shirt and his oldest pair of work boots. We added brown cotton gloves, a red neck handkerchief bandana, and my own belt. To create a hobo knapsack, we used a tree limb stick and an old torn sheet. For stuffing, I used wadded up newspaper pages. I learned to walk weaving style like I had had too much to drink.

How many of you remember the scare in the 1970s of railroad hobos and tramps coming into neighborhoods to steal, vandalize, and beg for handouts? During 1972’s, trick-or-treating evening hours, there was a radio public announcement cautioning consumers to be cautious whom you open the door for as local police were searching for several vandals that were known as train hoppers. I remember having to pull up my facemask to show myself and point out at the street to where my father was standing, or if we traveled by vehicle he would be by the front headlights driver’s side for easier visibility.

For my fifth grade costume in 1973, I borrowed my brother’s Sombrero that he won at a carnival. I wanted to be a Mexican Bandito. I wore jeans, a flannel shirt, mountain boots, and a handmade, checkered, multi-colored poncho. I was bright orange, dark blue, and black, and it had fringes at the ends. To disguise my face, I wore a pantyhose leg over my head and face, and then burrowed my hat.

As of 12/10/2012, I lost all my family. No one was willing to let me be out of the closet, proud to be gay and Pagan. I suffered from 12 to 50, forced to be a heterosexual male, including one failed marriage (no kids). I wrote them a farewell poem. I am all alone now.
