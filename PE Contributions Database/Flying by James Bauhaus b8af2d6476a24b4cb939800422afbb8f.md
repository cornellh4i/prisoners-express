**Flying by James Bauhaus**

Flying? I do a lot of it. Most of my flying is off the handle, like an axe head, spinning toward a particular television “expert” who is efficiently spreading a fake version of history that benefits him and his class of elite, hereditary rich super-criminals. For example, this month, PBS had an excellent series titled, “The Dictator’s Playbook.” Thursday’s 10-24-19 episode portrayed much of what we knew of Manuel Noreiga before and during his ascent to become the top cop ruler of Panama. The producers of this video are American, so naturally they left out most of the dirty work of our government. They noted that the route to power is usually through being ruthless cops, military mass murderers and fiendish politicians, but not how they are selected and assisted by our own fiendish politicians. Noreiga, they ‘forgot’ to include, was selected and assisted by the CIA, whom he helped finance collectives who farmed, manufactured and sold tons of cocaine. Big Daddy Reagan himself used Noreiga’s cocaine to start a crack and prostition epidemic in America, Europe and Britain to buy weapons for his ‘contras’ to fight his secret, outlawed war on Nicaragua. These acts are called treason and high crimes everywhere else, but, when you are writing the historical propaganda for American politicians, you customarily omit these truths out of ‘patriotism’*.

I’m going flying again this morning. Trumpty Dumpty is on TV, bragging about how ‘he’ (his military mass murderers) killed some Big Arabian Cheese that they selected. It sounds like they are calling their corpse “Allie Big Daddy.” He probably used to be just another member of the CIA’s hired killers, like Noreiga, Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, The Shah of Iran just to name a few in a list too long to remember. Trump, who was not there, proudly bellows that which he knows not: “Big Daddy died like a dog; a coward!” In reality, it will probably eventually leak out that he was murdered, while asleep in his bed, by a bomb blast, lobbed by cowards. At least they don’t seem to be parading his corpse around, like a cat playing with a dead mouse as a trophy, yet. I’m sure they will do this. As happened when the Rat Pack killed Bin Laden, there will be at least two of the killers write books, both claiming the glory of killing their sleeping target. I look forward to the day when our glorious military experts are let to go on TV and compete for the honor of claiming to have the shot, the fatal bullet into Allie Big Daddy’s bomb-blasted bullet riddled, shrapnel-filled corpse. Why? Not because I’m a psychopathic sadist, but because this is when I get to go flying again.

*Patriotism is where you lie to your own tribe to trick them into believing that their rulers have more, rather than less, integrity and honor than the common, law abiding citizen.
