**By Shannon Guess Richardson**

You found me. How did you find me? Those were my last thoughts before the bullet aimed at me ended my life. Then everything went black. The noises faded out, and I was no more.

This is me. The last seconds of my life. I’m looking at a psychopath pointing a gun at me. I knew in that moment that my life was over.

The psychopath is my husband. Love is such a strange thing. It can make you blind to the point of thinking someone is completely normal when everyone around you tries to tell you they’re not.

He started out normal enough. OK, so he was a little irritable, but he was stressed. I always had an excuse for him. Until he started using me for boxing practice.

When he surrounded the house with cameras and monitored everything I said and did, I knew I had a serious problem. I tried to get away, but he found out and punished me. I tried to get help from the police, but that only made it worse. I even contacted the local prison. Again, everything got worse.

I stayed in hell and did as I was told until I had enough money to leave. I dyed my red hair to the brown you see now. I moved from Ireland to America where I thought it would be easy to get lost in the crowd. I didn’t expect him to find me. Especially since I left him to die on my own bedroom floor.

Yes, I tried to kill my husband. I bought a gun to take with me for protection. He came home unexpectedly to “check on me” as he often did. He saw me packing and lunged at me--I reacted. The little gun did more damage than I thought possible. I told myself it was an accident, but I know better. I had pictured shooting him many times since I bought the gun.

I left him and went straight to the airport. I thought I was free, free from the prison of my marriage, from being beaten, from the hell that had become my life. I should have known evil wouldn’t die so easily.

But he found me. The funny thing is, he gave me the ultimate freedom. Now I have no fears and nothing to worry about. Death. Pleace. I am finally free.

Hold on, what is that bright life I see? I need to get a closer look. It’s beautiful. It’s...
