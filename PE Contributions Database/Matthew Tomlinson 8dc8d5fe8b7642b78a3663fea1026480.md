**by Matthew Tomlinson**

The moment I entered the restaurant, an ancient customer caused me to remove my cap. That very moment, Abbey Red said, “You need a haircut, wise guy!” From my right rose a diminutive Oriental, five feet two inches in a fire-engine-red pants suit. Was this to be my little piece of game?

“Yeah, I might get a little trim, maybe.” Maybe not.

Abbey Red approached. She peered through oversized round glasses in flaming red frames, studying my face. “There’s a short story called ‘Haircut’ by Ring Lardner. People talk about all sorts of things in a barbershop.” She used her forefinger to rub my chin. I’ll cut your hair this afternoon while we talk. You want it high and tight, wise guy?” She ruffled my locks, “You just want a little trim?”

“You gonna pull a badge like Princess did? You tryin’ to entrap me like she tried?”

Abbey Red put her fingers on my lips. “I’m no longer a peace officer. We’ll discuss my problems while I cut your hair,” she smiled knowingly. “It’s an order of magnitude more serious than what Princess got into with your teddy bear, Shotgun, watching her with those cameras. She was caught trying to entrap you. My problems are far more enhanced.” Abbey Red stuck out her tongue, childishly. “You mentioned Joker Box 31? Will you, um… pull it out and show it to me?”

I laid my briefcase on the table, and she popped the latches. “See that ugly soap dish with the slide switches on its face? That’s Joker Box 31, and so pull him out and play with him.”

Abbey Red got a good grip on Joker Box 31. “I saw devices at Fort Gordon with slide switches, but nothing like this.”

“Homebrew.” I pulled a bright red LED from my pocket. “You asked what Tone 7 might do.” The light was plugged into a slot on the side of Joker Box 31 marked as Function 7. “On the top right corner is a microphone. Hold your phone by it and send Star Tone.”

She gave a bleep of her phone’s Star Tone. Letters atop the slide switch assembly, A through G, illuminated. “That means it heard you. Now his phone number is 565-3731, as you see on the slide switches. Call him.”

She booped the seven digits. Nothing happened, yet. “Hit pound.” She blipped her phone, and the top letters went off. Letters below the slide switch assembly, A through G, came on.

“This means that Joker Box 31 is ready. I sipped my coffee. “Now see what Tone 7 might do.”

She sent Tone 7 then cut the tone. The light glowed then extinguished. “I see! How do I hang up the phone?”

Pleased, I sipped my coffee, “Zero out.”

Abbey Red sent Tone 0. All the lights on Joker Box 31 went dark, and her face shone. “This is something else we’ll talk about all afternoon! This is going to be a totally different hook-up than I thought too. Come on, Tee Dee. Let me give you that trim.”
