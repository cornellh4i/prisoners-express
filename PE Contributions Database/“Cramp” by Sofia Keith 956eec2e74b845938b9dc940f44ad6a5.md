**“Cramp” by Sofia Keith** 

I am surrounded by the gloomy miasma of depression, a dark cloud of living sadness that feeds upon me. I wander aimlessly as it devours my hopes, joy, love, and life. I care for nothing. Each step I take becomes harder than the one before it. I want the despair to end, but it does not. Life is endless drudgery, like a cold rain that never ends. I pray for death, and today my prayer was answered.

I see a figure in the fog, a geist dressed in black with a veil of night covering its face. I know it is death. He has come for me. I can no longer wack and drop to my knees. Uncaring, I watch as the spectre approaches with a feminine grace. I bow my head. It hurts too much to hold it up.

Death now stands before me and I sense an arm moving. I envision a skeletal hand reaching out to grasp my soul. Instead, I feel the warmth of flesh upon my chin. Death lifts up my head and tells me to open my eyes. I feel fear. I resist. Though I long to end the despair, depression has been my lifelong companion. Death repeats to open my eyes. I do.

Before me stands the most beautiful thing I have ever beheld. There is no longer the cloud of depression. No spectre to haunt me. I see instead a majestic veiled woman in a laced dress that appears as the starry night sky. She shines with the radiance of the sun.I look into her eyes and realize she has known me from my genesis. I feel the hope, love, and the compassion that depression denied me. It flows from her like a river that cannot be contained. I realize her presence was always there. I shut her out. My depression kept her away, but no longer. She will be my companion. My prayer was answered. I say her name, Sofia-Wisdom.
