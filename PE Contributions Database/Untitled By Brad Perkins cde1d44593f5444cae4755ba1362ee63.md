**By Brad Perkins**

I remember that moment as if it were yesterday, that kid Jason, Jake… something like that, was fooling around with my new camera at the bus stop while we waited for the next chapter of our lives to pull up and take us away from that dead end town.

Looking at the picture now, I can feel the powerful love I felt for Sarah then, as well as the hole in my heart that was left when she disappeared from my life all those years ago. I believed anything was possible as long as she and I were together. I believed that we were going to rule the world and live forever.

Sarah was unlike anyone I had ever met before (or since) in the small tosspot of a town where I grew up. She had been places and done things, she had been around and feared nothing… except being alone. She told off the high school dean in front of the whole school assembly when he criticized her bare midriff and received a standing ovation (along with a week long suspension). She even kicked Harold McGee right in the nuts for copping a feel in the hallway on the last day before Christmas Break!

She made me see myself as something other than Mickey’s plain-Jane little sister or the shy little bookworm I had always seen myself as. She made me feel sexy for the first time, and empowered like I crawled out of a cave that I never wanted to be in ever again. No matter how long I live I will always love her...
