**Cave by Brandi Belton**

Deep in a cave and seeing a man at the entrance would be such a great feeling. I feel trapped in a cave now as we are locked down in our cells not even allowed to take a shower.

I’m from a town that has Turner Falls in it and it has caves and what I would not give to have a nice God fearing man. One that wanted to be a gentleman, that shows respect and kindness to someone with a past so rough as mine. One that overlooks the mistakes to see the person, also the person I want to become. One that takes on someone with kids, that stands by them no matter what. Someone that makes my life better just having around. Someone who’s a provider like my dad has been.

Having hope like this seems like such a far fetched dream since my life has turned out like this. I still can not give up that idea that all girls I hope still have.

It will be far too long before I get to see any of the caves and trees and family and friends I’ve had my whole life. I just pray that they are having a good time in everything they do. That all their families have all they need and want. I’ll be here wishing I was there and would have been more grateful and taken care of everything better.
