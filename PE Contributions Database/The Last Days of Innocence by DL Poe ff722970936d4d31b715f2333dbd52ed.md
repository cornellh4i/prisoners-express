**The Last Days of Innocence by DL Poe**

My best friend Rhonda was a perfect example of someone who just didn’t understand what “cool” meant. I’d explained it to her many times, but she just didn’t get it. Like just the day before, we’d spoken about jean jackets. Personally, I didn’t think jean jackets were cool at all for girls in 1971. Rhonda strongly disagreed.

“They can be sexy if you wear it right,” she insisted, running a huge comb through her frizzy ‘do.

So when I saw her the next morning in front of Cleo’s diner, wearing her idea of a ‘sexy’ jean jacket, I had to run over. It was all I could do to keep my face straight and the laughter from my voice as I ran up to her, my purse banging and jangling at my side.

“What’s up bitch,” I teased, “nice wardrobe. Got a smoke?”

“Well,” Rhonda began, attempting to seem reluctant though I knew she was dying to tell me how she came by the interesting piece of ultra-groovy haberdashery, “if you mean the jacket, then yeah, it is nice. Only took me three fucking hours to get all my brother’s patches off of it.” She twirled around before tossing me a Camel and a light. I took a deep drag then leaned back against the building.

“I’m impressed. Never knew you had such a flawless navel,” I started in on her again.

She snapped a look at me suspiciously, saying, “Do I detect a little sarcasm there, heifer?”

I smiled, “Maybe a little. We gotta take a photo. I got my polaroid in my purse, see if you can get some guy walking by to take our picture.”

“What? Didn’t Sharon Tate teach you anything? We can’t trust random strange guys on the street. Actually, Pammy, I guess we can stop a stranger since my whore jacket, in all its glamour, if offset by the fact that you’re dressed like Carol fucking Brady,” she retorted, applying her own twisted logic, “Jeez girlfriend, where’d you find that dress?” She reached over and pinched my arm.

“Owww, slut, I’ll have you know this dress is the absolute pinnacle of Mount Cool. Besides, it’s reeeaally comfortable,” I defended my current fashion choice. Truthfully, I was beginning to feel a little self-conscious. Looking at her jean jacket made me feel a little better about my own choices.

“Oh shit mama, here comes Dumbass Danny,” Rhonda said as she stamped her half smoked butt into the sidewalk.

I looked up and sure enough, here came Danny Feuderschein, Dumbass Danny when he couldn’t hear us, and sometimes when he could. We all called Danny that because he was essentially a nothing man. He wasn’t cool. He wasn’t smart. He wasn’t handsome or charming, or graceful, or strong, or any other adjective I could think of that’s used to describe human beings in a positive manner. He looked like all the little Rascals rolled into one. If Alfalfa had Spanky’s weight, Buckwheat’s hair, and Froggy’s glasses, all the while dressing like a character in a Howdy Doody rerun, that was Dumbass Danny. He had a huge crush on me, though I’d been careful not to encourage him.

“Heeey Danny,” Rhonda and I both called at once, waving to him.

As he approached, I began to rummage inside my huge purse for my Polaroid. My parents had bought me the new Kodak 220’s for my birthday. It was the cutting edge of instant photography in 1971.

Rhonda threw an arm around Danny’s shoulders and gave him a peck on the neck, making him blush until it looked like his ears might catch fire. She didn’t do this out of friendship or affection. No one gave a flying shit about Dumbass Danny. She did it to watch his ears turn red. Such a mean bitch. I smiled just thinking about it. Guess I was a mean bitch too.

“Look here Danny boy. Me and my girl Pammy, we need our picture taken, and I think you’re just the man for the job,” Rhonda said in mock seriousness.

“Yeah Danny, how bout it,” I added. “Maybe if you help us out, Rhonda will pull her jacket the rest of the way up and give ya’ a look,” I teased.

Rhonda punched me in the arm, saying “Fat fucking chance, girl. Now stop before he has a stroke or something.”

“So Danny, what do ya’ say?” That was me. I batted my lashes at him for good measure.

“W-well, O-OK Pammy, y-you know I-I’d do it for y-you,” Danny stammered, intimidated almost into a urine stain by us two outgoing girls who hadn’t a care in the world and our whole future ahead of us. After two explanations and three tries, I was rewarded with the picture of me and my best friend Rhonda. It’s been my favorite always.

As I’ve looked back on it, I’ve realized why it was my favorite. Soon after it was taken, my carefree days were over. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, I found I did have a care in the world. Lots of growing up began to happen, and things were never the same again, never better than the day with my best friend Rhonda. December 12th 1971.
