**by Yankee Lawyer**

In the old days, the sun never set on the British Empire. The United States of America and the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales were spreading the gospel to the four corners of the earth. Gene Autry sang of love and adventure. Tarzan rescued black men from whites who sought to oppress them. Superman led the struggle for truth, justice, and the American way.

In my hometown, Plymouth, the streets were quiet on Sundays. Cars would be going to and from churches, but businesses were closed. A few small restaurants were open part of the day and closed on Mondays. Drugstores coordinated with each other and the police. On any Sunday, a few would be open at least a half day, the rest would be closed. A few mom-and-pop grocery stores were open half the day. The local I.G.A. store was owned by a jew, so it was closed on Saturday and open on Sunday, with a limited number of employees (His competitors and the police counted them).

I could go on and on about things I miss, things that went wrong in the ‘70s and ‘80s, and what a mess we’re in today. Right now as I’m writing this, though, there is one thing that weighs most heavily on my mind: the American political process.

Dwight David Eisenhower refused to run for political office. As a good soldier, though, when voters determined that he was the most popular and respected elder citizen in the United States of America, he answered their call.

Six decades later, we are in disgrace.

The Democrats have nominated a woman whose only noteworthy qualification is that she was the wife of one of the worst presidents in our country’s history. As Secretary of State under Obama, she was a scandalous failure.

The Republicans have nominated a man whose only claim to fame is, in a word, money. He got where he is through shady real estate deals, aided by highly skilled bankruptcy attorneys.

So...how much is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C., worth today?

In 1956, it was priceless.
