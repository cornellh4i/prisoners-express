**Debts by Roderic Pippen**

Debt is something that is owed to someone. It could be money, property, or something much deeper. I pride myself on not being indebted to anyone. But looking at my life, I can see where I am indebted to a few people.

One being my older sister, for always telling me what’s right. No matter how far fetched it seemed to me at the time. I lived my life according to how I see things that day. But my sister always tried to instill in me the morals I needed to be a good man. But being ignorant to responsibility, I thought she was trying to control me. Even though I’m now serving a LIFE sentence, she’s still here helping me to change my outlook. And use my morals as a guide to be the best version of myself. So I can as a man say I’m in true debt to my sister  for raising me and putting in the work to develop me once I threw my life away. Now, I think of ways I can repay her for everything she has done for me.

Another debt I owe is to my son, Roderic Louis Pippen Jr.. At just 11 years old, he loves his father unconditionally. He doesn’t know the reason I’m locked up, nor does he care. He’s always happy to talk to me on the phone and even happier when we have our visits. He serves as my motivation to change into a better man and gain my freedom. So I can be there for him when he needs me. This being my darkest moment; he gives me light everyday. I owe him for opening my eyes to what’s really important. What truly matters, loving those who love you. And being comfortable being who you want to be. I’ll spend my life repaying him for the strength he gives me daily.

Lastly, I have my father to pay back. Although he wasn’t the best example for me growing up. He was always there, and always tried his best to protect me. Even if it was from myself. Because he lived life, he knew what the wrong choice could do to me. And tried his best to guide me away from the streets he knew. And when I turned my back on his tutelage, he still supported me whenever. I landed myself in a troubled spot.Even now he is raising my son, just as he did me. Trying to protect him and guide him away from the wrong situations. He doesn’t owe me anything, but he still provides shelter for both my son and myself. And continues to give me life lessons that will stick with me long after he is gone. And through both my son and I, he will continue to live, protect, and teach.

Those are my debts I will die trying to repay. Stuff that can’t be monetized or devalued. But are the most important parts of my life. And will affect the futures of people who may not even know me just yet. But the man that has been molded by these debts, will do right by the world. One way or another, I will make a difference. All while clearing my debt…
