**"Oral Hygiene" by John Naylor**

I grew up in the church: my family attended about twice a week when we could. We had some folks we met at a church retreat called “Heartland” in Indianapolis. Little did I know how complex some of those new relationships would become, but I made a new friend.

Brandon was kind of awkward and had a vibe coming off of him like he wasn’t comfortable in his own skin. I learned that his family recently moved to central Indiana from Lafayette.

Time marches on. I end up seeing his family at my home church. I was only about nine years old when they started attending. He had a sister named Kristen. She was older than me by about three or four years, like my brother Andy. Even at nine, I was a ladies man at the church retreats.

One day, I’m at a church function for the youth that we called “Bible Hour.” Kristen was acting cute from across the room, so I waved and she came over and seductively asked to borrow twenty dollars, which was a lot for me at the time. She seemed like she may have had a creative way of showing her gratitude, so I loaned it to her. Weeks marched on, and her behavior seemed like she wasn’t interested in me at all. I finally asked her about the money.

Now, she acted like it was a gift. I didn’t so much as get a hug or the chance to feel her up, so I’m pretty angry about it. Then, her and my brother Andy become a couple of sorts. Young love I can understand, though I wasn’t able to forget about the twenty dollars. On top of that, she had a history of dating around. It seemed that she didn’t have much regard for the men in our church. That wasn’t something I could respect. It made me angry that she didn’t treat them right. Hooking up wasn’t a trend back then. I don’t think she slept with anyone, but she played with my money and men’s emotions.

Years go by, and I’m friends with her brother still. We hang out all the time, and we even have a clique of fun loving guys raising hell. Her dad became really anal, and he probably wonders why he had so many bills for collector’s items and china dolls you see advertised in magazines. Slow learner, I guess. He tried to explain it to these companies forever. God only knows how much stuff he had to mail back. I know who it was, but he had good reason. I’m fiercely loyal, so I’ll leave it at that. The clique knows. He was a conservative dad, so some anal behavior was to be expected. We often just overlooked him as we did what we liked.

One day, I’m at Brandon’s house, and I had been partying all morning. We’re getting ready to go raise some hell, and nobody is home but Brandon. For some reason, I kept thinking about his sister and the twenty bucks. I was feeling good, but not too good to finally get my revenge. I asked him whose Listerene was in the bathroom. As fate would have it, only his sister liked that Listerene. I told Brandon that I was finally going to pay his sister back for all that bull she pulled. He tried to talk me out of it but to no avail. I had to be careful not to piss in it too much or she’d know something was up. I told Brandon I’d get him if he snitched me out or interfered. Every week, I’d ask about the Listerene. As it turned out, she gargled my piss for weeks!

One week, I ask Brandon about it. He said he saw his dad using it that morning. Apparently, he couldn’t tell. Dean shouldn’t have used it, but it was funny, especially because he checked his son’s eyes like he was the police looking for drug use. He was just so anal that I didn’t feel bad about it.

Sometimes, practical jokes have unintended victims. It can be unfortunate, sometimes anyway. Always be cautious of who you screw over though. It may be years before they get their revenge. It may be the last person you expect. If they’re known as monsters of revenge, it may be in a very unorthodox manner. That doesn’t mean it won’t come. Be mindful of how you treat others. A stoner might have you gardling his piss for over a month with your family, or even worse.
