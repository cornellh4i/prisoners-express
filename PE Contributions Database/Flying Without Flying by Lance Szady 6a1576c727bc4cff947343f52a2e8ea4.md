**Flying Without Flying by Lance Szady** 

When my eyes close with heaviness and slumber takes hold, the walls of my prison crumble and the period of being unaware shatters. When the rare dreams from childhood emerge, I am soaring through the clouds with eagles at my side, or leaping above buildings and being weightless. These are the dreams I pray for because most nights my dreams are a replay of things I’ve been through and done; karma’s way of making sure I never forget the things I’ve done, so they may never be repeated. It’s ironic though because in most instances I am uncomfortable and have a sense of uneasiness when faced with heights, except when I’m secure, like flying in an airplane, or being in a harness connected to a building. Maybe my dreams of flying is my subconscious reminding me I still want and need freedom, that my mind may never be caged, or perhaps a deeper level where my soul is still free and at peace where I catch glimpses of it from time to time. Regardless of the reason why it happens, every night until the last time my eyes close, I will always hope that those elusive dreams of flying through the cities, so high above the mountains and forests or sitting above watching the world go by greet me when the sandman pays his nightly visit. A few ideas came to mind when I first read the theme word. I’ve been on an airplane seven times and four of those were courtesy of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which is memorable to say the least, and I barely remember the other three. One instance at Logan International in Boston was crazy but writing it would be like telling stories that I’ve been telling and retelling over the years in prison. So I wanted to start with something that’s real to me and that touches me at a primal level, if not physical. “Flying without flying”
