**“The Atelier” by Robert Taliaferro**

“There is a symmetry to her movements, the way that the beads drape from her neck and her bracelets garnish her arms,” the master said to his students as the young woman entered the room.

“Namaste,” she said in a small alto voice that seemed to fill the room, even though slightly spoken, like the subtle smell of jasmine.

“Even her voice defines symmetry,” the master said, as he took up his charcoal and paper and began to sketch.

Following his lead, his students began to render drawings of the beautiful young woman who had entered the room.

The woman stood, confused, perfectly framed in the doorway to the small room. Spread around the atelier were a number of tables that had small tubes of paints. Large canvases of the master were hung haphazardly on the walls, while others were strewn on the floor.

Behind her hung one of the masters woven rugs; its ruby red acting as a backdrop to the young woman who stood in an ivory white veil that framed her face so perfectly that when the light struck her, just right, the students could not help but to be taken by her exotic beauty.

“Yes, yes,” the master said to himself, and that brought the students back from their reverie. They knew that when he was finished with his sketch, he would come around to look at their work, and if they did not have something substantial on the paper, they would wish that they had stayed home that night.

By then, the young woman was even more confused. She had been sent to the room to ask a question and here she was standing, while all of these crazy Frenchmen sketched furiously with pieces of charcoal on rags, and paper, and wood.

“Please my dear, could you turn a bit to your left, then raise your hands in prayer again?” the master asked, and she did as she was requested.

That slight movement brought into play the light reflecting off of her necklace and allowed the pearls on her forehead and hands to glisten whiter than white, like small stars that flashed within the radiance of the woman’s exotic nature.

Her bracelets never seemed to move, and the colors, muted as they were, offered a counterpoint to the pale shell-colored dress and pale blouse that the young woman wore.

“Could you stand straight forward and look up my dear,” the master said after a few more moments, and the woman--anxious to leave from this crazy place--did as she was asked.

“Notice the fullness of her eyes,” the master told his students, and he started to chuckle.

He knew that when he looked at the sketches of his students he was going to see perfect beauty defined by the beauty that radiated from the woman... yet, he would be disappointed in what they would create.

He often shared this disappointment with his wife Amelie. “They are great technical artists,” he would say, “but they seem to lack the ability to see the poetry of the models that they paint or draw. They don’t see beyond what is sitting there in front of them...they only see the subjective essence.”

The young woman began to search the room anxiously until she laid eyes on the young man on the furthest side of the room and tried to get his attention.

To her dismay, he was so focused on his canvas that he seemed to only see her as the object that he was to draw.

Seeing her discomfort, the master said, “Just a few more moments please...we are almost done here.”

Hearing that, she looked back at the master and was put at ease by the childish gleam in his eyes, only slightly hidden behind rounded glasses.

“Voila, I am done,” the master exclaimed, which was the signal to the others in the room that they were done as well.

“Thank you my dear, for your patience,” he said to the woman, who by now was obviously furious.

“So, did you want something?” the master asked, knowing full well that he was going to have a story to tell from the reply.

It was then that the woman entered the room fully, walked over to the man who was in the furthest end of the room and knocked his canvas from his hand.

The sketch appeased her anger a bit, as it was a perfect rendering of the beautiful young woman. She hid the small smile that she felt coming to her lips and picked up the canvas before she chastised the young man.

“Saddiq, do you wish to draw another thing of me, or are you now ready to get married?”

It was then that the master began to laugh, and his students followed suit.

“This is not the way to start a marriage,” the master said to his young student, “trust me...I know.” As the woman passed out of the room she glanced from drawing to drawing until she got the the drawing of the master.

“This...this,” she spluttered in anger, “this thing does not even look like me, she said, shocking the other people in the room. “You had me stand here only to humiliate me with such a thing as this,” she said, pointing at the drawing that was on the master’s pad.

Everyone in the room gasped, but the master only smiled, then raised his sketch so that everyone in the room could see what he had done.

“That is where you are wrong my dear,” Henri Matisse said to the young woman, “they have drawn you as you are now...I, however, have drawn you as the woman that you will become.”

As the woman stormed from the room with her future husband following close behind, the master pointed to the rendering that he had created.

“Notice that there is symmetry in her movements; the way that her beads drape from her neck and how the bracelets garnish her arms…” he said with a smile as she turned once again in anger, “and the fire in her eyes…”
