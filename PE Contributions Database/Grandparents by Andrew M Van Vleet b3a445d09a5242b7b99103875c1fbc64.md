****My best role models have always been Gramps and Granny. I don’t know of anybody I’ve met who embodies the compassion, kindness, virtues, and love of a Christian like them. I would have done well if I had not ignored the lessons they taught me. My biggest regret is letting them down.

Growing up in a broken home, I had only Gramps and Granny as my source of stability. Mom’s moods and overbearing protectiveness kept me cooped up inside and I was often grounded from playing with friends or even doing Boy Scouts or youth group at church. Through the years, I could always count on going to Gramps and Granny’s every Sunday. It was my escape, almost surreal in the moment I got into the car. I felt enmeshed in love, trust, and happiness. As intangible as those feelings were, I could almost grasp them as my hand closed around the car door handle.

Gramps and Granny made me want to strive to be better. The aura of positivity that surrounded them was almost entrancing compared to the dismal life at home. They made me want to help others through church and volunteer work. All the time they put into volunteering still amazes me. If anyone needed help, they were there. I learned most of my life lessons growing up at their house. Where else could I have learned table manners, discipline, responsibility? I learned to take pride in my work while doing yard chores, fixing things, or helping with dinner. I learned that I had family that cared about and loved me. And I learned that their disappointment could cut a hole through my heart like nothing else.

Today, Granny has passed on, but I thank God that Gramps is still here. I have a chance to make things right. It’s funny how even in prison, I remember being told, “If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right.” I heard that countless times from Gramps and Granny. I’m doing this time in prison, and Granny would want me to do it right. So I’ll make the most of this time and learn all I can. I hope everyday she knows how sorry I am to disappoint her, and I want to do better. I hope Gramps can see the changes I’ve made when I get out. I just want them to be proud of me again. I am thankful everyday that I have the best grandparents in the world, and even though it took a huge wake up call, I will strive to be just like my Gramps and Granny.
