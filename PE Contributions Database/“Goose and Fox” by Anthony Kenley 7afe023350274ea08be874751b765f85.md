**“Goose and Fox” by Anthony Kenley**

****My, you are certainly the best au pain I have ever had. No other has even bothered to take me for a stroll.

Mummy says you have such high recommendations from the British Hen Housers too. That’s high praise indeed.

I have never been to the woods before. Is it quite safe? Oh I do hope I am no strain. I have been eating quite well lately. “Getting a little plump,” mistress says. Oh! Foo on her.

Do you have any idea what is for high tea today? Whatever it is, I am sure it will be quite delicious. Don’t you think?
