**“My Parents” by Chad Frank**

My mom grew up in Fishtown, a working-class Irish Catholic neighborhood in Philly. Like most Fishtown girls, she got good grades in school and never misbehaved out of fear of offending her elders and God - in that order -- and the guilt that surely followed. For fun, she hung around Newt’s, the playground at the center of the neighborhood.

My dad came from a broken home, so never lived in one place for too long. When he met my mom, he and his sister, my Aunt Monique, were living with my Grandmom Frank in Kensington, a rough-and-tumble neighborhood literally on the other side of the El tracks. There was one thing that followed my dad wherever he went: his delinquent ways. He had been to juvie several times for vandalism and earned notoriety as a graffiti artist, using the tag “Hawk.” He and his friends had long hair and listened to Kiss and other Hard Rock bands, smoked weed and drank, and hung around Twey Playground, Kensington’s counterpart to Fishtown’s Newt’s.

I never tire of hearing my mom telling stories about how she and my dad met when they were both in the sixth grade.

With his long hair, concert T-shirts, and bad-boy reputation, my dad must’ve seemed like Gene Simmons walking into a Donna Summer concert on the first day of school. And he was treated accordingly. Most of the popular girls thought he was a scruffy weirdo; all of the boys wanted to kick his ass because he didn’t conform to their concept of masculinity. But it was those things that appealed most to my mom: my dad was unlike anything else she’d ever seen.

What followed is a real-life **West Side Story.**

In order to meet up, my mom and dad had to cross enemy territory. Back then, Philly was strictly divided into neighborhoods, each with their own racial, religious, and economic boundaries. Those who were brave (or foolish) enough to cross them were dealt with severely. Fishtown and Kensington were perfect examples of this dichotomy, and its teenagers were constantly at war.

Unlike the Fishtown boys who beat up my dad whenever they saw him, his friends were always very protective of my mom whenever they ushered her onto their turf. I chuckle whenever I try to imagine my prissy mom “slumming” it on Kensington’s grimy streets, among its abandoned buildings, hookers, bums, and drug addicts and dealers -- a far cry from Fishtown’s tidy houses and stores and more family-friendly environment. Even funnier is picturing my mom climbing through my dad’s second floor bedroom window.

This went on for about a year and a half before my mom got pregnant. They were both only 15, which obviously posed major problems.

My mom conspired with her friends on ways to explain what had happened that didn’t involve the obvious -- all the while my mom was wearing baggy clothes to conceal me growing inside her. It wasn’t until her mom confronted her that my mom revealed that she was pregnant.

Her mom wanted her to give me up for adoption, which my mom considered until the nuns came from the adoption agency to start the process.

Her dad, my Grandpop Mckeown, had a much more violent idea: if my mom didn’t agree to have an abortion, he would cut me out of her stomach himself.

My mom remained defiant, wanting to have me despite the many obstacles I’d present.

And so I was born, almost three months premature, on September 8, 1981. I spent my first few months in an incubator and was so tiny, I could fit in the palm of a hand.

My dad wanted to name me Ulysses after his pet hamster. My mom ended up naming me Chad after a kid whose mom kept yelling his name on the playground while my mom was pregnant. My mom wanted to give me her maiden name, Mckeown, but both my grandmothers made her name me “Frank,” my dad’s last name. Who knows why, since his father’s last name was Bunning. It’s a big, long story that I’ve not been able to fully sort out.

Realizing he needed to grow up and take care of his responsibilities, my dad decided to enlist in the military. But not before one last fling to celebrate his 18th birthday.

He and his friends got drunk and high at Tewey. At one point, my dad decided to come visit my mom. Since he’d spent all of his money on booze and weed, he didn’t have any carfare to catch the El, so he decided to transurf. His friend Spider tagged along. My dad had transurfed countless times, but this was Spider’s first time, so my dad had to guide him every step of the way.

First they scaled onto the roof of a nearby building. Then they dropped onto the awning of the El stop and waited for a train to pull in. When one did, they climbed atop of it and proceeded to “surf” as the train went clattering down the tracks. Things went well until they neared a trestle. My dad turned to tell Spider to duck. His reflexes dulled, my dad was unable to heed his own advice, and whacked his head. He was thrown from the train, onto the street below. Dead on impact.

Having witnessed my dad’s violent death, Spider was never the same again. Though I never met him, I hear he became a hopeless drunk and drug addict, trying to blot out the traumatic memory.

Sensing a damsel in distress, guys swooped in to try to rescue my mom, but she was too busy trying to figure out how to raise herself and me alone. Meanwhile, my Grandmom Frank was busy filing lawsuits and selling off my dad’s belongings. She was off to the gambling boats in Mississippi before the dirt settled on my dad’s grave.

My mom was forced to grow up quickly. Instead of becoming a dental hygienist and marrying a dentist on the Main Line, she dropped out of high school just months shy of graduating and got a job at a donut shop. That’s where she met my stepdad, Bobby.

Bobby was everything my mom could’ve asked for: a tall, dark, and handsome bad boy with a good job and a car -- both of which promised escape from her increasingly dysfunctional home life. Her stepdad Petey was an abusive drunk who demanded my mom hand over half her paychecks to live there. At any given moment, he’d put out guns and threaten to kill everyone in sight.

At first, Bobby treated my mom with respect and we bonded over a mutual love of pro wrestling. That all changed after my mom and Bobby got married when I was three. Bobby morphed into a monster whenever he got drunk, which was every weekend, viciously beating my mom while I watched on terrified and helpless.

I held out hope that things would get better, but they only got worse when my sister was born when I was six. In order to cope with my constant pleas for attention and my sister’s incessant crying, Bobby drank and got high more frequently. By then, my family was living in Port Richmond, a working-class neighborhood known for its boxing gyms. Our living room was a boxing ring, and I constantly had to barricade myself and my sister in my bedroom to avoid becoming Bobby’s next sparring partners. These memories are battered into my brain.

Somehow Bobby was able to stay out of prison and maintain gainful employment. My mom was also able to get herself a position as an office manager. By the time I was 16, they were able to earn enough money to move to the Far Northeast. One would think that such upward mobility would domesticate Bobby’s inner beast, but it didn’t. Normally tranquil suburban weekends became warzones.

Over the years, Bobby has been given chance after chance: my mom taking him back again and again, getting out of jail with just fines or community service, employer-funded stints in rehab, being cured of Hep C, and most profoundly and perplexing, being allowed in his grandson’s life. Yet, he remains an abusive asshole. And for this, I hate him. I’ve not been given one good chance, let alone as many as Bobby has and he doesn’t even appreciate it. But Karma is starting to catch up with him. Years of drinking and drug abuse have taken their toll on his body and mind, and he’s become a shell of his former self. And his abusive ways have alienated him. I refuse to talk to him, my mom is planning on divorcing him, and my sister limits access to his grandson’s life.

Through it all, my mom and I have remained close. We’ve practically grown up together, and have endured so much. Too often, we were all we had. Even after I disappointed her and let her down by coming to prison, we have remained close. Though we are hundreds of miles apart (she is still in Philly, while I am in North Carolina), we talk on the phone almost every night, and she comes to visit as often as possible. And for all of this, my mom is the most important person in my life.
