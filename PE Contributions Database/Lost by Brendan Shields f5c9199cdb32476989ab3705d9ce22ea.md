**by Brendan Shields**

I stood naked, staring at the double security doors. Clutching the heavy fire resistant blanket, my head swam. Behind me: years of drinking and drugging. A fog of ranting and raving. Ahead: years of imprisonment.

Lost in a dark sea somewhere in my own timeline, I groped for a thought to cling to. My heart lurched. Escape was impossible. The guard passed, eyeing me skeptically, on his suicide watch rounds. Someone screamed down the corridor. His voice softened by concrete and steel between us.

Curling up on the cold slab, blanket too small for my long frame, I shuddered, then sank. Beneath a lifetime of madness, suffering, and loss. I wept.
