**“Commitment” by Shaun Blake**

My parents have been married for 60 years— 55 ½ years before my father died and 4 ½ years since he died. I state it this way because of our religious affiliation: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe in marriage for time and all eternity— celestial marriage. So, even though my parents are now physically separated for a time, they’ll be together spiritually for eternity.

This is a wonderful thing. My parents love each other more than anything. They experienced a lot of hardships in life and because they love each other so much they stayed together faithfully, growing stronger through it all. They helped each other to overcome personal flaws, familial difficulties, societal barriers, and spiritual confusion. I wish we all could be like them. The world would be a different place, a happier place, a kinder place.

I haven’t followed in my parents’ footsteps. This I tearfully regret. I’m not going to go into painful details of a life full of mistakes, loss, and anger. This is all in the past. I’m still alive and can— have— changed. For a while longer my mother is here on earth with me and is still my guiding light. The memory of my father is centered in my mind, and because I believe he is able to look down on me and influence me in many ways, he enhances the guiding light with my mother. I’ve given them many reasons to cry— sorrowfully and happily— in my life. My end-of-life goal is to bring only the happy tears.

I love you Mom and Dad. Thank you for bringing me and my brothers and sisters into this world. Don’t be sad over the choices we’ve made, because these choices are ours and are not a reflection of your efforts. You’ve always been a positive light in a dark world.
