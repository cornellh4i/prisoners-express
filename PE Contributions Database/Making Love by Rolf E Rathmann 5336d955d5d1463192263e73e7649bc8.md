**Making Love by Rolf E. Rathmann**

Not war. War of words. Words that hurt. Hurtful action. Making love, not war. That’s a theme in my lifetime dating at least the Vietnam era. But with the advent of social media came a tribalism that formed a moat around our lives. More in -your- face bigotry added to the mix, and a powder keg seemed ready to ignite/ Essentially a simple phrase such as “make love” seems at best, quaint, at worst, an anachronism, and highly unattainable.

I grew up in a loving home and a supposedly safe neighborhood with open-minded parents who, through their actions, preached tolerance and respect. Our world was torn asunder when a bullet, and an assailant merely wanting money, nearly ended our mom’s life. That’s when I first knew hate.

The perpetrator was black. My mom, white, being too young (or too sheltered) to understand that race played no role, I harbored resentment and fear towards black men in particular. If someone from a different race walked behind me, my senses were heightened. I’d slow down, pretending to spot something of interest in a shop window, letting the object of my derision pass.

A few years followed and, sick of living in fear and now old enough to understand the error of my thinking, I did change. However, not without a few stumbles. One late evening after a school dance, I saw some black teens milling about. Though my gut told me to steer clear I chalked it up to racism on my part. To prove myself better than that, I opted to walk through their clique, I was beaten up. Fortunately, though time, age, education and life’s experiences (combined with a whole lot of therapy), I would learn more effective ways to challenge my “isms” while placing everything, such as race, in perspective.

As a gay male, I too would experience hate. I was bullied or called derogatory names. Feeling self-shame at my core. I engage in a way of self-inflicted hate via internalized homophobia, and addictively unsafe behavior.

The nineties saw its share in a war of words. 1992 was pivotal for me. I was watching a political party convention. Many speakers extolled with great passion and vitriol “Family Values”. That planted a seed within me of hate for the “other” side- people who felt that anything diverse or different, such as an un-wed mother, an illegal immigrant, gays, etc, were not part of the fold. Today, I’m very much a part of the tribalism, where other views are wrong, I am right.

As that decade came to a close, activist friends challenged me to look at my own “white, privilege”. What did it mean to be white in America? How did I knowingly or unknowingly encourage systemic racism? By merely being born white, what benefits did I receive? There were not comfortable conversations. Even now, with all of this woven into the tattered fabric of American life, these are not comfortable discussions to have.

2020- societally,  we are more divided than ever. Extremes on both ends of the spectrum fight for airtime, political cover and legislative victories. Our nation is in a metaphorical war, long ago skewing a concept of love.

Humanity is on full display as a weary nurse uses an iphone in order for a family to say its final goodbyes to the family dying alone in isolation. Love rules the day.

Finally, as for myself, sitting in prison for the wrong I’ve done, well, this is not stereotypically the place where one finds love in full view. But I can still do my part in a significant way. By loving myself enough to make the right decisions to move forward, towards a purpose driven life.

Making Love, Not War. It’s not an unattainable goal, but it can be seen lost in all the din. I hold on the promise of hope, believing in time that the strains of bigotry, bullying, shame and violence can be supplanted by the chords of their opposites.
