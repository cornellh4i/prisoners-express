**“Coffee” by Frederick Mason**

If I can make an essay out of something like coffee in prison, then I can write about anything, so, let’s take a stab at it.

If you’ve been reading my journals or essays, you’ve seen that there are so many things about prison that the average person knows nothing about. Society only sees prison through the media’s eyes, which is based on what prisons and county jails show them. And while it’s not the media’s fault, since they can only report what is given, it also ignores that the inmate has a voice. I wish people would listen to what we have to say.

So why am I talking about coffee? Because in most prisons and jails, coffee is a really critical thing to have. I never thought much about it before I got arrested. I mean, at home, I drank very little coffee, maybe a cup or two a week, and only during the winter. And if I did drink coffee, it was with a LOT of sugar. But here, in prison, it’s essential to at least half of the inmate population.

Why is coffee so valued? I think many guys here drink it for the caffeine; here at USP Tucson, they don’t give us any sugar. All the drinks are diet, the candy is sugar free, and even the water is…

poor joke...but you get my point.

They sell Sugar Twin and Sweet & Low in canteen, but to be honest, I hate those. But I need to sweeten my coffee.

And I do buy coffee, Here, at this moment, they sell Keefe Columbian for $3.40 a bag, Keefe Columbian Blend for $2.80 a bag, Maxwell House for $3.05 a bag, Folgers for $6.90 a jar, and Taster’s Choice for $8.90 a bag...but they’re getting rid of Taster's Choice for some no-name brand called “Deep County”, a brand NOBODY asked for, yet this prison insults us and insists it was OUR idea. Idiots.

So, if I don’t drink coffee so much, why am I buying it? And as of the writing of this essay, I got a LOT of coffee. If I drink 2 cups of coffee a day, what I currently have may last me a YEAR! SO...why do I have so much?

Because coffee, I’ve found, is a great icebreaker. It comes in handy when people are down on their “luck” (I don’t believe in luck, I believe in God), and need something as simple as a cup of coffee. Coffee drinkers know that feeling when you take that first sip of coffee… the calmness you get from it. No different here. In stressful times, sometimes a “spot” of coffee helps so much. I don’t drink a lot of coffee, but I know that many do. So, when I can splurge, I buy coffee, sometimes creamer and Hot Cocoa powder, to make blends. For example, I have a bag of Keefe Columbian and Maxwell House Blend. That bag alone can likely last me a month.

Sometimes I buy coffee for certain people. One kid here, Tino, is 22 years old. He’s a good kid, like a little brother to me. He loves coffee, but can’t afford to buy it. So, I try to keep coffee on me; whenever he needs some, I’ll fill a small pill bottle of some, and give it to him. I told him, “When I buy coffee, it’s usually for you.” But I also share with others, while being discreet. I can’t share with everybody, because as you’d imagine, there are people who only take, and never give and some that are never appreciative of what is given to them. Believe me, I’ve learned my lesson of being “too nice.”

Yet, it doesn’t take away from my compassion. I know I can’t drink all this coffee. I’ve got like six Folgers jars full. I like sharing, it makes me feel good. And yeah, next time I go to canteen, I’ll likely get a little more coffee. It’s just good to have in case somebody really needs a cup to start their day, or just to kinda relax.

It’s just my way of trying to help some of the guys here, in the midst of their troubled times.

Just recently, I went out on the yard to take tino some coffee. I took a large pill bottle of coffee (Folgers and Columbian Keefe mix) to give to him on the yard. But he didn’t show. I was kinda disappointed, but while I was on the yard, another guy, Art, came over to talk to me. As we were talking, he was disappointed that he came out to meet somebody who was supposed to GIVE him coffee. Art rarely comes out at night, but he did because somebody was supposed to give him some coffee. I joked about it, saying, “Well, it just so happens I was supposed to GIVE somebody coffee, and they didn’t show...so, by default, YOU get the coffee,” and gave him the pill of coffee I would have given to Tino. Art was very thankful to get it. And I wasn’t worried about Tino, I had plenty to give him next time I saw him. Things kinda worked out well, I had somebody to give coffee to, and the guy needed to get some. This just shows you how coffee is so important to inmates, and how I try to use it to be helpful to others while I am here. It really allows me to be compassionate to those in need.
