**“A Foxy Feathered Affair” by Bobby Bunderson**

Once upon a time, in a peaceful little hamlet known as Mukilteo, there lived a small and oddly dysfunctional family known as the Gandersons. The father’s name was Bobby “The Goose” Gunderson, who was the village’s bread maker who was married to Porcupine Patti. She was a slender lass who had the reputation of having the disposition of a badger. Together the Gandersons were busy raising their little fledgling Kristlunne, known by all in Mukilteo as princess Kriste.

For all intent and purposes, Porcupine Patti was a mean and unhappy woman. She was not content living out her years in such an unremarkable existence. Her husband Bobby Handerson was a badly broken goose who just could not live up to his full potential. While Bobby was growing up, his father the Big Bad Wolf had really done a number on his eldest son. He reminded Bobby daily that he would never amount to anything. Those words stuck in young Bobby's heart and ended up haunting him for most of his life.

For several years Porcupine Patti and “The Goose” pretended to be happy together for the sake of their little princess, but then he turned to drugs and alcohol to help ease his pain, thus ridding himself of his heartfelt shame of being a failure. Broken and disgraced Bobby packed his bags and flew across the country to live with his mother in Souk Village.

To outsiders Souk Village seemed like a very quiet and laid back community. However, the native inhabitants knew better. Souk Village was a small town with big secrets! It didn’t take long for Bobby to discover its daytime soap opera qualities. On Bobby’s first full day in Souk Village, he and his mother Dena went to the towns’ laundromat to do the laundry. This is where Bobby first laid eyes on Mikki Fox. She was the attendant overseeing the laundromat and Bobby's heart did a flip when he first saw her. It was love at first sight! But Bobby soon discovered that Mikki Fox was already married and then it dawned on him that he too was still legally married.

Bobby and Mikki Fox soon became friends, friends with benefits, another Souk Village scandalous affair. Bobby believed it was true love but Mikki Fox explained, to his dismay, she didn't love him back. Broken hearted, Bobby Ganderson called up Porcupine Patti on the phone and convinced her to return to him. This was not the “Happily Ever After” Bobby had hoped for. Porcupine Patti was immensely unhappy living in Sauk Village. Bobby surmised that this was mainly due to the fact that Porcupine Patti soon learned of the foxy feathered affair between badhered Bobby unmercifully until he relented and agreed to move back to California.

And so the Gandersons packed up and took a Greyhound back across the country to the West Coast.

A few months later Bobby “The Goose” Ganderson received a letter from his mother Dena. In the letter was a picture of beautiful baby goslings. Dena told her son that she strongly suspected that the gosling was his. As much as Bobby’s heart wanted to believe this was true, his mind told him that it wasn't. Bobby was not a very lucky bird. He truly felt as though he had a curse upon him or something of the like. Bobby stared at the beautiful baby gosling. When he turned the photograph over he discovered the young gosling’s name: Lysette Nicole. What a beautiful name, he thought to himself. He never forgot her name.

One day when the young Lysette was old enough she went on a secret quest to find her real father. When Mikki Fox discovered what Lysette was up to, she hurriedly snatched the young gosling up, placed her in a large basket stroller and whisked her away where she kept her isolated in a castle. Mikki Fox told Lysette that she had done a foolish thing. And for years to come, Mikki Fox held young Lysette captive in the castle until she was old enough to set out on her own.

Thirty years passed. Computers had made it much easier for folds to locate long lost relatives. Lysetter, now a beautiful goose with two goslings of her own decided it was time to finally unravel the mystery about her father. Through a DNA locating search engine she at long last had found her father. But as happy as she was, she was also just as sad. As it turned out, her father was a criminal and was serving a 25 year to life sentence in prison. Bobby “the Goose” Ganderson was a jailbird!

Lysette gathered up her courage and wrote her father a letter, not knowing what to expect. Bobby’s heart broke as he read her words. Tears of joy coursed down his cheeks. Today Lysetter and Bobby are trying to build a relationship. Today Bobby no longer feels sad, and Lysette? Well she’s just fine. This fairy tale is about family, failures, heartbreaks and uncertainties and how they can be overcome. Today, this is a “Happily Ever After” story. The End…
