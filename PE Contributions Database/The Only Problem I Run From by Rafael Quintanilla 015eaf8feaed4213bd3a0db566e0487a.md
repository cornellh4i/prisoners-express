**The Only Problem I Run From by Rafael Quintanilla**

Sometimes bad decisions will haunt us like the darkest creatures in our recurring nightmares. They might seem endless, devastating, and dark, but every nightmare ends with a light of opportunity. An opportunity to correct our mistakes and not be defined by them but defined by our righteous acts and accomplishments. We all have the capability to overcome any adversities through consistent effort of positive actions.

It starts with hunger. A hunger to reach our full potential, strive for greatness, and positively change our lives. We can’t change the past, but every decision we make will be etched into the unwritten book of our future. We’re the authors that decide whether the hero or villain prevails.

I hope all of us get to experience the day, that glorious day, when the hopeless villain emerges as the hero after defeating evil and victoriously ascending to the peak of Mt. Everest. Life will suddenly have purpose and direction. Humanity’s biggest problems will take one step towards the ultimate solution. Newfound attributes of respect, love, honesty, selflessness, humbleness, and righteousness will radiate an aura that will brighten up any darkness around us.

Most of us, surrounded by darkness, just go with the negative flow to avoid conflict. It’s easier and less stressful at that moment but has destructive effects on our habits, impulses, and future. These wrongful actions, like all wrongful actions, also have a negative ripple effect to our direct and indirect surroundings. They tip the universal scale of good and evil in the wrong direction. All we have to do to restore its balance is reverse those dark ripples with light by: feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, caring for the neglected, giving prisoners a platform to be heard (thank you PE), or sharing wisdom with the world. We all have the same opportunity to make a positive change no matter what our situation is. We can end a nightmare at any time. All it takes is a decision to shine light instead of infecting the world with darkness. It was the best decision I ever made.

I didn’t always make good decisions. I’ve actually made quite a few bad ones that created many irreversible problems. This is why I’ve focused so much on improving the way I solve them. Now I’m quite good at it.

Since negative emotions cloud our better judgement, I suppress them by focusing on understanding the cause of the problem rather than letting my emotions escalate it. This redirection of focus, with repetition, is the key to transforming negative emotions and impulses into positive ones. After weighing out the pros and cons, I choose the solution that minimizes the consequences to everyone and everything in existence.

Sometimes I already know the best solution because I spend a lot of my free time mentally creating problematic scenarios, relevant to my life, then solving them in my head. This method is the key to making good split-second decisions. If only I knew, then, what I know now…

I’m currently at Florida State Prison, on maximum management, with the most dangerous inmates in Florida because my past keeps overshadowing my existence. I’m confined to a one man cell and only allowed to have paper, pen, stamps, and envelopes. I’ll be stuck here for at least a year.

There are three solutions to my life’s biggest problem. One goes against my morals and values. Another goes against my natural human instinct to survive. The last option is to run. This is the only problem I run from. But what happens when there’s no room to run?

Somewhere out there, one of you is contemplating on joining a gang. Learn from my mistakes, don’t do it. One day, your morals and values will change and you’ll be left with three options: defend your life, be killed, or run. Every time I’m forced to deal with this problem, my life gets harder and I’m tattooed with new physical and emotional scars.

In this game of life, sometimes we get stuck with a bad hand. Instead of letting it discourage us, we should use it as motivation to rise up, beat the odds, and reach our full potential. It starts by developing a righteous mind through constant observation of our thoughts, then redirecting our negative ones into positive ones. Positive thoughts produce the positive emotions that keep our minds clear, allowing good decisions to replace bad ones resulting in positive actions. It’s an endless process of trial and error that’s never perfected, but gets finely tuned through repetition. The key to its success is consistent effort.

Everyone seems to be holding better cards than mine in this game of life, but because of my selfless, righteous, and positive mentality, I’m still in the game and I’m positioned to win.
