**The Road Keeps Going by Richard Schmidlkofer**

I'm always on this road and I feel I'm the only one on this road and it keeps on going.

I want this road to end to be free from it. This road has nothing on it. Everything is dead, no life.

I noticed this road has several cracks in it like me. I have a lot of cracks in my life that have to be fixed.

Only person who can fix these cracks in my life is Jesus and Jesus is far away. I can't see him, but he is there at the end of this road. PRAISE GOD :)
