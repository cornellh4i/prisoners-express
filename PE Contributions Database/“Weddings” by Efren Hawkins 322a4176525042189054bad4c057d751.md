**“Weddings” by Efren Hawkins**

****I’ve been a part of only one wedding in my life. I have to admit it was a nice experience,  even though I wasn’t the one getting married. I was the groom something- that shows you I really don’t know anything about weddings except that they bring everyone together for a special event. I kind of wish I would have had a wedding to bring my family and friends together for something good to remember about me.

Oh yeah, I took the easy way out and got married at the courthouse. I’ll advise anyone, if possible, have yourself a wedding and enjoy life, because you only live once. Put yourself and the one you love first and make that day special for the one that’s special in your heart and the loved ones that surround you. If not, you’ll be wishing you could do it all over again a different way. Sometimes weddings break down those walls that block you from the limitlessness of happiness in life. Place yourself on a bigger scale than the one you hold yourself back with. It’s like that puppy you have chained in your yard. You both would feel a million times better if you would release him. That way you wouldn’t have to go check on him, because he’ll be all over you every chance he gets.

During a wedding, special words will be said that wouldn’t be said otherwise. Take these words from Mr. Bob Marley, “Rise up this morning. Smile with the rising sun. Three little birds pitch by my doorstep. Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true. Saying ‘this is my message to you.’” In my own words, I would say, “we were brought together because it was decreed for us to spread the joy of life together. I look to you, when I lose my way, because we love each other for the sake of our creator. And we wish for each other all that we wish for ourselves.”

So enjoy your wedding, even if it’s only in your dreams. Think, how you’ve had dreams that have come true. When it comes true, remember I told you and enjoy yourself by fulfilling your duty as a husband or a wife. When you light those candles, light one for me and enjoy the bounty of blessings that are yours.
