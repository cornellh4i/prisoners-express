**Zoo by Norman Theriot**

The penal systems of this nation are the keepers of the zoo across America. It is supposed to house grown men and women but in fact houses animals made up like humans.

Humanity is supposed to be disciplined, and was created in Godâ€™s image. Instead we are a hodge podge of attitude and animalistic beings who are selliah and quady, who are uniting one another and strive to experience the suffering of others.

There are all manner of people here, of psychopathic mentality. PTSD, OCD, like disorder schizophrenia are but a leer manipulation one sees here. All to often close captivity comes psychological issues. When an animal is caged long enough the life force fades.

Men are herded like cattle here, mass movement to chow, laying required for other movements like medical, law library, poude on what else we need to leave our living are for, we are exhorted to and from our job assignment.

We are on display for officials to see at any given time. THe audits they have several times a year, the deferred inspection that they know about months advance. We are expected to behave during viewing times.

I wonder how the powers that be look in the mirror knowing that they are a part of a machine that devours the minds of men and women leaving nothing but a shell of the former person. Knowing that they too are deserving of the cage that they hold others in. Animals are within these walls but they are also without.

We are judged day in, day out. We are reminded of our transgressions every moment of every day. Many are overwhelmed by quilts, many have great remorse all the while leung stereotyped with the worst of the worst. I wonder. Is humanity doomed to be guests for justice, after all those who judge us have done things in the past. Those who hold us are a corrupt bunch blandishing the pow like a whip, a meano that lings pleasure to many.

We the incarcerated are poured in a game, one of which there are no winners, only various degrees of lessons, every person being merely holes in time. EWe live in a zoo for a different kind of animal. The oppressed, and the alienated. Too many exiled, some for something they did not do.
