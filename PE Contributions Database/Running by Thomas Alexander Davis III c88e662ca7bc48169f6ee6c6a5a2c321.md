**Running by Thomas Alexander Davis III**

Running, running from where? Running to who? Run for me and I’ll run for you. I’m glad this theme was chosen. I feel the DNA of my ancestors boiling. Run free, run free… don’t stop, just breathe. I’ll run until I’m beyond your reach.

How did we get here?

How did we get here?

How did we get here?

How did we get here?

It started with you calling me a color instead of identifying me as your brother. I’m not black and you are not white. You know this man. We have been pretending to be ostriches and stick our head in the sand.

Unacceptable to call an Asian woman yellow? You know it’s true. That’s why you don’t put it on a damn application or Driver’s License or Certificate of Birth. So, why do you insist on these appellations? Deliberately dividing the Nation. Deliberately cancelling me out and then getting delirious, rabid, violent, and frenzied when I so eloquently and specifically point it out.

You don’t call my people from India brown people. I said my people because 7% Indian from India, that’s me. I took the test from 23andme. It took the National Football League how long to recognize the error of their ways. Whose idea was it anyway to call humans a RACE, a RACE?, a RACE?

We have the ability to use drones to do surgery, identified Planck’s constant, and a discontinuous transition of an electron, and utilized game theory to enhance our net worth.

Yet, we continue to run this “con” that less or more of melanin should make us a judge, jury and executioner. I’m not cool with that. Are you?

Running, running from who? Running to where? Run for him and I’ll run for her. I’m glad this theme was chosen. I feel your DNA roaring. Run free, run free… don’t stop, let him breathe. He just wants to breathe. She just wants to breathe.

All people just want to be!

If she wants to identify as transgender, it’s her journey anyway. We all need to learn to be tender and kind. We all need to run to the aid of our neighbor and just let her be.

Run to the aid of our NEIGHBOR? Isn’t that the Golden or maybe the Silver Rule… Do unto others as you want them to do unto you.

Run, run free… don’t stop just… just breathe. We’ll run till we are both free… run until we are out of their reach.

How did we get here?

How did we get here?

How did we get here?

.... better yet do you really care? Or am I just an animal in the zoo only for your entertainment and pats on the back. I AM REAL. SHE’S REAL. HE’S REAL.

WE DESERVE TO BE HOME, SO RUN AWAY WITH THE 13TH AMENDMENT. And it’s all skullduggery, skullduggery… I am not your SLAVE.

Run away from the truth of that I’m stuck in here with a life sentence based on false evidence and denial of Public Records, police report, and damn FBI 302. Why is Anthony Hatahway SIIS at home? I’m like Cinque/Seng Bey in Amistad, me want free… run the facts on that.
