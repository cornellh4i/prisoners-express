**“The Present or the Bargain” by Seth Deadface (Brent Elskan)**

“How much farther, Turner?” asked Hinda.

“Mm, can’t be too much longer now, darling,” replied Turner-of-Many-Stones, pausing for breath, squinting ahead as he tried to pick out the trail that would lead to the edge of the human territory. “Tell me again, Hinda. About the wedding?” Turner wanted to distract the goose from his heavy breathing and their upcoming encounter.

“Oh, it’ll be so beautiful, Turner! The full moon, the flowering ivy around the clearing, the fireflies all over the trees, and the berry feast all arranged…” Hinda went on, and Turner smiled as he pushed on, the little rolling basket creaking as they went by the abandoned building that marked the outskirts of human-dwelt areas.

Turned hoped it would be as lovely as Hinda imagined. It wasn’t exactly the most popular union amongst the geese, and the few friends Turner had left among his fellow foxes seemed strained. Still, many understood, considering how they’d met.

~~

Turner-of-Many-Stones heard the loud honking and thrashing one afternoon around the pond. Creeping low and quiet, he saw the poor goose, its leg clamped by those awful steel jaws, the jaws chained to the stake buried into the root-tangled earth beside a tree. He’d seen the trap before, as a cub - his sister, Bird-Chaser, had been caught, the trapper coming along to kill her before she could chew her way free. He saw his sisters fur and tail on the man’s feet later.

So when the same man-thing came crashing through the brush, Turner couldn’t watch it happen again - he leapt out, barking and biting. Somehow, the man was driven off, leaving behind only bloody drops and a piece of its paw. Turner went to the goose, worn down from her prolonged efforts to fly away.

“I can free you, goose-sister, but it will hurt, and you will lose your paw.”

“Stay back, fox! I will peck you blind! I will not be your easy meal!” the exhausted Hinda squawked.

“I will not eat you.” Turner insisted. “‘Please - I would not wish to see your feathers decorate the man-thing. Let me help.”

In the end, Hinida’s pecking was too feeble to be much harm to Turner, and he managed to bite through her leg quickly. The goose passed out from the pain, so Turner guarded her from his own kin until she awoke. Even then, she resisted trusting him, but she could not deny that he’d kept his word, and her wounded wing (broken by her earlier struggles) forced her to accept his aid in the coming weeks, when the snow drove her kin south.

The woman was cleaning up dinner when she saw the strange couple approach her door; a toy baby carriage with a goose in it pushed by a small fox. The goose fluttered out clumsily, landed badly - the fox dragged a sack from the back of the wicker carriage, which clunked like a bottle as it hit the packed-dirt drive. Catherine went to the door.

“Broken wing?” she asked the startled pair.

Nervously, the fox came forward, dropped the sack at her feet. “Yes, great witch. And her leg.”

Catherine checked closer, the goose shyly balancing on one foot. “Mm. Let me guess - one of Donald’s stinking traps again?”

“I do not know the main-thing by name, Mistress LaFleur. If you say it is this Don Auld, it must be so,” Turner agreed. “But yes, a trap, the steel teeth.”

Catherine nodded, muttered under her breath - “Fool man. Trapping, in this day and age, like a Davey Crocket fanboy.” - and reached down for the sack, peered in. “Ah! My favorite: rum and cola.” The witch nodded. “But, fox… the leg?” A meaningful look, questioning.

“I know, Mistress.” Turner replied. “Will it work?”

“Will what work, Turner?” Hinda asked, frightened. “You said she could fix the wing. What’s this about my leg? You - “

“Now, now, Hinda” cut in Turner. “Just let me bargain with Mistress LaFleur, will you? It’ll all be fine.” He looked again to the witch. “Will it?” he asked again.

“Maybe.” the woman nodded slowly.

“And must I bring more?” Turner pressed.

“Tell me, ‘Turner’,” the witch demanded. “Was it you who took Donald’s finger?” She waggled her right hand before her.

“The trap man? I took a piece of his paw, yes,” Turner admitted.

“For me!” Hinda honked. “He saved me! If you won’t help, don’t punish poor Turner for his kindness, great witch.”

The woman chuckled, turned to go inside. “Punish him Ha! Consider the work paid in full, my little friends. Come in, then - we have work to do.”

~~

Hinda swooped in a great circle, then awkwardly settled down beside Turner, honking in joy. “Oh , Turner! Thank you so much for my wing. I just… the leg… it’s -”

“Bah, my love, hush.” Turner interrupted. He walk-skipped to nestle into her neck and curl his bushy tail around her replacement leg, black like his left paw had been. “It’s a wedding present, I said - no way you can refuse now anyway. Besides,” he went on “I had four to your one. What could I do but try to make it fair, eh?”

Hinda sighed, held back a sob, resigned herself. “Yes, okay, as you like, darling.” She ruffled her feathers, like shedding water. “Alright then… about the wedding, hm?”

Turned looked fondly at his beloved. “Yes… will you still have me, my love?”

“Of course, you furry little fool.” Looking thoughtfully at the trail heading out of town. “Walk me home, Turner-of-Many-Stones?” He saw a smile in her eyes.

“Well, if you don’t mind me skipping a bit,” the fox grinned back. “Bless the witch, eh?”

“Oh, yes, darling - bless her indeed.”
