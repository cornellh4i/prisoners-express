**“Emerging From the Fog” by Stephen Lee Birchfield, Jr.**

****Emerging from the fog is not an endeavor that most of us would venture to undertake. The path of least resistance is the mantra of the masses. Staying on this well trod path makes the fog easy to bear. We become so acclimated to the murky and unsure, cloudy existence that clarity is perceived to be a menace. The brightness of the sun terrorizes us.

We all- at some point- must emerge from the fog. Whatever your particular brand of fog may be. In Texas prisons they have these fog machines to quell riots. These things will fill a huge chow hall in a small amount of time. The point is, not all fog is the security blanket we tend to weave around ourselves. Some fog is maliciously foisted upon us, and coughing and gagging it tends to make the strongest and bravest lay down any thoughts of rebellion. It is at these junctures we beg for clarity, and are so thankful for the mercy our masters bestow upon us when the exhaust fans kick in. Notwithstanding the lack of circulation in hands with zip ties cutting into skin. This is a game in the macrocosm. Becloud them with noxious fumes, then run in and act as if you are the loving caring slavemaster. Instead of hating master we turn around and believe he is a benefactor. It is simply more fog, easier on the breath. Stockholm syndrome on a grand scale.

To emerge totally from the fog is most likely an impossibility. We need some type of delusion to get us through life. Life sucks, then you die. This knowledge is too horrible for many people to accept. One day at a time a personal inventory is warranted, just to ascertain where we are bullshitting ourselves if we are capable of doing so. Many are too self absorbed to take inventory. Which is a paradox. All these people care about is themselves, yet they refuse to face the ugly truth about themselves. Their fog is a brick wall made from arrogance and complacency.

When first emergence transpires it is painful to the eyes. You rub them and blink rapidly, not believing what you see. One screams back into the fog: “Come see what I am looking at”; those who will not emerge are scoffing and rolling their eyes. “Ole so and so has gone off the deep end, a few bricks shy of a load” they will say sagely. Yet still they have not made the attempt to leave the fog. You will be astonished how the naysayers abound when you leave the fog. People get downright vicious. Usually these are people whose duty it is to keep people in the mist for some devious purpose. Don’t give up, keep plugging. Emerging from the fog is not for everyone. Rewatch the matrix and decide which pill you want to take, red or blue, ignorance or knowledge. This is an everyday decision. To not decide is to decide. There is no escape. Alas. The end.
