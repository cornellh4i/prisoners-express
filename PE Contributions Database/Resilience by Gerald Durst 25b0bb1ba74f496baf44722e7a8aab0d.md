**Resilience by Gerald Durst**

Resilience- The Merriam-Webster Dictionary: /ri-zil-yons/ N: 1) the ability of a body to regain its original size and shape after being compressed, bent, or stretched. 2) an ability to recover from or adjust easily to change or misfortune.

As you can see by the definition of this word from the Merriam-Webster’s dictionary, it can very aptly describe an individual who has come to prison.

Not everyone who comes in here is very resilient. Most become conformers. Yes, that’s what I said, conformers. They fall into the trap of the Prison Mentality. That’s the mindset that use the phrase “well, that’s prison” as an excuse for their behavior here. It’s so they can feel good, or at least better, about the things they do in here. Prison DOES NOT have to be this way.

Someone who is resilient can bounce back from the shock of being dehumanized by the authorities who strip us naked as the day we were born, put us in jumpers, and haul us away from our friends and our families and our lives. From all that we know to this world of misery and suffering. Believe me… this place sucks.

Now the folks who can come in here with one foot still out there and not fully assimilate into the Prison Mentality are doing very well.

Resilience is being able to come in here, see its full stupidity, its hate, its dehumanizing, and adjusting accordingly without fully participating in it, or taking on its language and mannerisms.

This is a temporary residence, not our human. This is a bunk we sleep in, not our house. We don’t live in these dorms/wings alone. So many people take no consideration for those with whom they must share a living space. Rude behavior is accepted and it should NEVER be accepted or tolerated. You didn’t tolerate it out there, why do you put up with it in here?

But even more is leaving here, and re-entering society. The shock of leaving here can be pretty profound depending on how long you were inside. A lot changes in 5 years or 10 years or more. Here again some of us are able to adjust pretty easily.

Some of us are able to go with the flow no matter what the changes may be. We are able to adapt, overcome, even improvise. Of course this doesn’t mean we take on the bad habits of others, or conform to their idea of the norm. We adjust so that we can live no matter where we find ourselves. We’re respectful of others even if they are not, or even flat out refuse to be. We take others into consideration. It’s not about me. About that other person.

It’s about doing to, or for, others as you would want done to you, for you. Not everyone is resilient. Not everyone can adapt. These people are bitter, centered on self, what the self wants, what makes self happy, and damn everyone around them. Those who can adust, who can change with the changes in their life are miserable and try to take others down with them.

Adjust with your life situations. Find your joy and happiness, but be mindful of those around you. You never know another’s emotional or mental state. Just because you like to play your music of choice loud doesn’t mean your neighbor wants to hear it.

Slamming that domino doesn’t get you extra points, and is angering others

Your friend’s not a dog, so whistling at him because you’re too lazy to walk over isn’t cool.

Don’t use prison or anything else as an excuse to be dehumanized, or to dehumanize others. Show resilience. Show that you can adapt and change.

Show that you can be better than your environment or your situation.
