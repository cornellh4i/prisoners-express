**“Wakeful” by Seth E.**

She’d awaken in the small hours, as she often did these days, and rose - with popping joints and stiff muscles - to walk out the consequences of sleeping still for hours. Her body seemed intent on punishing her whatever she did. Sitting for too long, sore, stiff muscles. Move around too much, aching joints and a different kind of muscle pain. Age simply punishes.

She made her way into a robe and to the kitchen without waking Ty. As she filled the kettle she glanced at the fridge door, the cacophony of crayon drawings, aged cards, old photos, and other miscellany stuck on with random magnets advertising cities or insurance agents or whatever. Putting the kettle on the flame, she riffled these mementos absently, recalling their arrivals, or the people in the pictures. Children and grandchildren - even one great grandchild! (Was she really that old now?) Nanette’s party invitation, all glitter-glue and sequins. Cade’s drawing of her and Ty and the dog, Jeep, from back when Cade was still called Jennifer and wore dresses. A photo Harriet had taken with Jeep on her lap and Ty’s hand on hers, the dog’s snoutful smile aimed up at the camera as he savored belly rubs.

The kettle started a low whistle, cutting her reverie off while she made tea-mint and catnip with honey, leaves she picked and dried herself a few weeks ago. Little Roya had called it “magic tea” and swore it had medicinal qualities of near-miraculous proportions, if only for stuffed animals.

Seeing memories, her eyes wandered through the kitchen windows out to the backyard; her kids swinging on the old salt-and-chain swing set; the grandkids bribed with ice cream to gather all the walnuts so Ty could mow the grass, Jeep chasing squirrels or leaping through the sprinkler after the little ones. It was a good life, full of love and joy.

But her thoughts turned, as they often had to, upon the future ahead: Ty slowly becoming someone else, forgetting people, events, whole years. Some days he needed constant watching over, others just occasional reminding. Putting a little money aside for some help had become a wise investment, and she’d discover a kind of friendship in a big, gentle Derice.

When she made her way toward the living room, she caught a glimpse of Ty though the doorway of their bedroom, sitting up, looking out the window. She altered course, the tea slashing to sting her hand.

“Ty? Are you okay? Are you hurting?” she asked, laying a hand on his shoulder.

“I’m fine, Claire-Bear - just wakeful.” His use of her old pet name told her he was probably having a good day. They sat together quietly, watching the leaves of the old maple in the front yard as they danced in the breeze.

“I was just remembering the way Jeep used to chase the little ones through the sprinkler in the summer-remember that?” she asked. He grinned, chuckling.

“Yeah, old Jeep…” his smile was nostalgic. “When I come back to myself, I can remember all the stuff I’d been forgetting. I feel bad for not remembering the important things, like the grandkids or friends… or Jeep.”

“Old fool” she admonished him, though lovingly. “You don’t do it on purpose. You aren’t letting anyone down.”

“Except you,” he half-whispered, turning to look her in the eyes. She could see a small reservoir of tears threatening to break over his lashes.

“Oh hush -” she began, but he put two fingers over her lips, cutting her short.

“No, you hush, Claire-Bear. Listen, while there’s me enough to say it.” He swallowed hard. “I regret only a few things in this life: never finishing that degree, running that light… and Tammy…”

Claire’s eyes clouded as he mentioned the little girl they’d lost, their first pregnancy, never viable. The doctors had said that risking the birth would have put Claire’s life at risk and the baby’s. Even if she’d lived, they’d probably have had to keep her in a special home, or put their own lives into orbit around her. Claire had grieved, so had Ty - it was a kind of shared misery which, paradoxically, hadn’t ruined them, as such things often do for couples, but brought them closer.

“Before I go for good,” Ty went on, “you gotta know… I love you like a tree loves rain, and I never blamed you for anything we suffered.”

She nodded, smiled, cupped his bristled jaw with one hand. She tried to say “I know”, but her voice was too thick, so she just nodded. And she noticed the bottle on the dresser, its lid left aside. Empty. Like the class beside it. She gasped, eyes going to his. “No!” she choked.

“Love you, Claire-Bear” he reminded her, kissing the palm of her hand, and laying down again. She lay beside him and wept.
