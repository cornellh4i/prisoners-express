**“Sisters” by Cesar Hernandez**

We go to so many places on my sister’s fourth birthday. I wake her up very early. I want the two of us to have breakfast at Central 214.

At Central 214, I have my usual, steak, eggs, pan-fried potatoes, freshly squeezed orange, and freshly squeezed apple juice. My sister has one scrambled egg, a plate of fruit, and orange juice. I go to Central 214 all the time. At least twice a week, sometimes three times in one day. This is the first time I take my sister. The staff keeps asking about my sister since they have not seen her before.

After breakfast, we go to Starbucks across the street. My sister has a tall hot chocolate and cupcake. I get my usual vanilla latte and cranberry orange muffin.

We drive to the mall. We go shopping at Nordstrom. We head to the children’s department and I buy my sister some things. They also have some kid sunglasses so I buy them.

My sister is so tired of walking so I carry her. We go to the mall Starbucks and get her a grande Passion Iced Tea Lemonade. I get the venti size.

My sister wants a frosty and to go to the zoo. The week before we went to Wendy’s. She did like the frosty. Usually, I have a no food rule in my car. Since it’s her birthday, I let her eat the frosty in my car. I tell her not to make a mess in the car.

We spend a couple of hours at the zoo. We go to the petting zoo section. She gets to pet a rabbit and gets to feed a baby goat.

She’s hungry so we go to the zoo food court. I buy some chicken nuggets with fries. The drink comes in a pink container shaped like an elephants head.

I ask my sister if she wants to go home. She says she wants to go play golf and race cars. We drive over to speed zone. We buy some mini golf and go-cart tickets. We play some mini golf for a while. Then we get on the go-cart track. Speed zone has two tracks, the slick course and the regular course. We ride both tracks a couple of times.

My sister is finally exhausted and wants to go home. As soon as I put her in her car seat, she instantly falls asleep.
