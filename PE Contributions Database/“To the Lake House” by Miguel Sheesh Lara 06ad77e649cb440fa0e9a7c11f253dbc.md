**“To the Lake House” by Miguel Sheesh Lara**

It’s here, the day that I dread. I believe it’s the day we all dread. The last day of the summer. The last day at the lakehouse. The last day of fraternizing with the local girls at the Rec Center. Last chance to pick up locally brewed sodas, beers, and Blueberry Milk. Last day of the locals laughing at us out-of-towners’ accents and rituals. Here it’s smoking. This is nice. I watched the last sunset of the summer at Crystal Lake. It’s like time just stands, everything fades to mush, nothing matters. Heading back to college, helping my parents close the cabin up, even helping my little brother and sister clean and help the boat up and shut the boat house close. Time fades and flashes all the summers ‘99-‘19 just seem to fit in the colors of this sunset. Ugh, I love it. I just hope I have the privilege to give my children the chance to enjoy their summers here. From adolescence to puberty to grad party. As I did, first kiss, first lay, first drink, and first smoke. I got here during the summers at the lake house. Big exhale. I truly love this dock, this town, this place, and in ten more minutes I’ll go help. Lay back, hands crossed behind my head and I enjoy the sunset.
