**“Beautiful Flowers” by John Naylor**

When I was a boy, I, my brother Andy, and my Mom Retha would spend quality time with our Mamau. We would drive around in the 1983 Buick Lesabre, run errands, and go to church, and so forth. One day we were driving through a neighborhood on a weekday. My mind wandered as we cruised along in the backseat.

Suddenly my attention was focused as Mom declared, “Look at the tulips!” I started to scan the yards. No tulips were in sight. Mamau figured it out before any of us did. She loudly declared, “Retha, those are trash bags!” to which we all laughed. You see, my Mom suffers from being nearsighted and she’s legally blind. Of course, this wasn’t the first or last of such occurrences. There’s no judgement, only love.

The humility of personal limitations wasn’t needed. There was no shame. Instead we looked at it as seeing the world from a different perspective. Now I’m grown and nearsighted myself. If I don’t wear my glasses I’ll risk waving at strangers and other semi awkward moments. In retrospect these moments were not always just errands or quality time. I learned family history, made memories, and learned to take things in stride.
