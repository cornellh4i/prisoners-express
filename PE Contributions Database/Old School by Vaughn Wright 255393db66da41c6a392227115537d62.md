**Old School by Vaughn Wright**

I stepped up on the porch with my 10-year-old son and rang the bell. It was a nice house, a two-story colonial on a quarter-acre lot, the same as ours.

The man who answered the door was tall and burly, with gray eyes in a fleshy pink face. He was wearing a starched white shirt over gray slacks. Expensive cologne. He looked me over, then my son Stan, who had a Band-Aid on his forehead, a scrape left on his left cheek, and a split lip.

The man brought his gaze up to me again, and said, “Yes?”

“You Marty Mabry’s father?” I asked him.

“Yes,” he replied, already getting a sense of … a situation.

“My name’s Shawn Palmer. Marty and my son Stan here went through a little something after school today,” I told him. “I brought Stan over here so they could straighten it out.”

He said, “Marty did that to him?”

“Not quite,” I said. “Seems after Stan and Marty had some words and started getting into it, a couple of Marty’s buddies didn’t like the way things were going and decided to give your son a hand.”

Mr. Mabry turned away from us and angrily bellowed, “Martin! Come to the door!”

When the kid appeared at his father’s side, I couldn’t believe he was a 5th grader. He was a head taller than Stan and looked like his parents fed him a steady diet of buttered biscuits. No wonder he thought trying to bully someone Stan’s size wouldn’t earn him a punch in the face, all the way up until he got the black eye I proudly saw he had.

Mr. Mabry asked him, “Care to tell me again how you accidently got that shiner in gym class?”

Marty’s eyes fell down to the welcome mat.

“Well?” his father impatiently prompted him.

“No sir,” Marty mumbled, before raising his head and an accusing finger at Stan. “But he threw the first punch! He started it!”

“And you pals Robert March and Pete Nakamura finished it for you, right?” I said, mindful we’d be making trips to each of their homes after we were done here.

Marty gave Stan the mad-dog stare, and said, “I didn’t tell the other guys to get in it. I coulda handled him by myself.”

Mr. Mabry put a hand on his son’s shoulder to silence him, and said, “I don’t approve of Marty fighting, Mr. Palmer.” He reprovingly glared at the boy. “You can rest assured he’ll be severely punished.”

“You wanna punish the kid, that’s you business. I brought my son over here to get some satisfaction.”

He was a little slow on the uptake, but he got there okay.

“What, you mean so they can fight again?” he said, as if it was the most abhorrent thing he’d ever heard.

“That’s right,” I said. “They can go in the backyard, let it be just the two of them this time, and then afterwards they can shake hands.”

“Absolutely not,” Mr. Mabry said, fanning his right hand like a windshield wiper. “There isn’t going to be any fighting here.”

“Listen, Mr. Mabry, they can finish this up here and now, or in school later, but I’m not raising my boy to turn the other cheek when a bunch of cowards try to take his dignity.”

Mr. Mabry got red in the face and tremulous in the voice. “My son is not a coward,” he said.

“Then let them go one-on-one. Old school.”

He shook his head, clearly not grasping the limit of options.

So I slapped him.

He was so stunned he didn’t say anything. I could tell he wanted to make a run at me by the way his gray eyes blazed while he was rubbing his cheek. He had three inches and about thirty pounds on me. If he wanted to mix it up, I was game, only he was trying to prove himself too genteel for such impulsive barbarism.

I pointed to a clear spot out on the lawn and said, “You boys go on and handle your business.”

Marty looked uncertainly at his father, who was still gathering himself, calculating.

Mr. Mabry told me, “I should call the police on you.”

“Sure,” I said. “ Probably wanna sue me too, right?”

His jaw clenched. A tick developed in his left eye. Mr. Mabry finally took his hand away from his cheek. “Go ahead, Marty,” he said, giving his son a shove out the door.

We were eating dinner later that night when the doorbell rang. My wife Lorene went to answer it.

When she came back to the table, she told me, “Some guy’s here to see you, Shawn.”

I got up and went to the door. Sure enough, it was Mr. Mabry. I wasn’t very surprised to see he hadn’t brought his son along. I gave him a nod of greeting but didn’t wait for him to say anything, because I knew what it was about. I motioned him in and led him to the back of the house.

“Hon,” I said to Lorene as we passed through the dining room, “this is Mr. Mabry, Marty’s father. We’re gonna be in the backyard for a bit.”
