**"Halloween" by Chad Frank**

Fall is my favorite season because the weather gets cooler, and the leaves turn beautiful colors. I especially love fall mornings, the smell of leaves burning hanging in the crisp air.

Halloween is my favorite “holiday” because it’s the only day I can be whoever or whatever I want--including my true self--without fear of judgement.

As a kid, I spent months planning my costume. My efforts paid off, winning me first place in costume contests and tons of candy (my mouth is watering just thinking about caramel apples and candy corn).

I still love a good Halloween party--the decorations, the cheesy/”creepy” music (my favorite Halloween song is “Monster Mash”), and the tricks and treats… especially the tricks!

And who doesn’t love a good scare? I miss going to haunted houses and on historical ghost tours. One of the biggest highlights of my year is watching the horror movie marathons on cable TV.

No Halloween would be complete without a rereading of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” and Ray Bradbury’s “The Halloween Tree.”

I love Halloween so much that I have two jack-jack-jack-o’-lantern tattoos and plan on getting more Halloween-themed ink.
