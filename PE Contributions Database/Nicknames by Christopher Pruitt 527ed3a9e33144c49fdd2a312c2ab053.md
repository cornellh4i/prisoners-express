Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me…

What a lie we teach our children, and how cruel parents and other siblings can be. Sometimes the names we call others encourage - but some stigmatize.

I was a premie - and as with most premies was slow to develop in all areas of my life. Sadly, this carried on until my aunt said she’d break my need of diapers (I was four) by giving me a nickname. Combining my middle name, Dale, with diaper became: Diaper Dale. Cruelly my aunt called me a baby - soon my brothers, sisters, and parents joined the bandwagon.

I’d cry mercilessly as Diaper Dale was turned to horrid songs about things which I had no control. For the first time I wanted to die - but like getting rid of that name, I didn’t know how.

Sticks and stones would have broken bones - yet bones mend. Words shatter souls - some souls never heal. Or heal like a badly set bone. It’s a shadow you can’t escape.

In a visit the other day, my brother (whom I’ve not seen in sixteen years) asked if I remembered (shamefully, head bowed)...that name they used to call me. Like an old friend, loneliness flooded me as I nodded yes.

“I guess,” He said, “We were too harsh on you.”

Silence. We stared at that aunt’s photo…

Even more silent, “I’m sorry hluey (My Grandma’s nickname for me).”

We can all have more than one, I guess.
