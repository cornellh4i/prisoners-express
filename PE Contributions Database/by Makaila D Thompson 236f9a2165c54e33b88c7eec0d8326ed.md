Makaila D. Thompson

Stagnate scenes, wasted dreams, breaking at the seams. Echoes of my past coming back fast. Happiness doesn’t seem to last, calamity conforms as my smile quickly deforms. Lost lonely destined to fall, too damn young to want to end it all. Had a rough childhood, had to grow up too quick, but all it took was one needle prick to gain a habit. Be hard to kick, no faith left into my arms. This disruptive static fills my head “maybe I’d be better off dead” more than just a pretty face on that endless dope chase its reality. I was trying to escape so I poke another piece of my soul. It’s like I’m a falling flower all tattered up and shattered. It’s like I’m a dork princess locked away in some far away tower. It’s like does any of this shit matter? Believe it or not this is who I used to be. Nobody really knows me. It’s been bottled up here at DOC. I finally had to release - please tell me what you think- I’m more than just a number attached to my name.
