**“Nature Hike” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

I followed the path down the hill but I have lost my way.

Now clouds hide the light of day.

Should I follow the stream? What should I do?

This isn’t on my map and I don’t have a clue.

Now I’m in the valley and I can’t see what’s up ahead.

This nature hike has made me feel a bit misled.

At least I can get a drink of water to refresh myself.

I’m getting so cold and now my feet are numb.

If everything wasn’t wet I’d light a fire.

One road is all I desire.

I wonder how long it will take for a search team to find me.

And to think, the brochure said, “mountain retreat, a must see!”

There isn’t a soul in sight.

Yet I must not give up, I must fight.

I’m so cold and I need to rest.

No, keep moving is best!

I yell for help, does anyone hear my plea?

I can’t go any further, someone help me.

The ice broke, now my feet are wet, what do I do?

I’m so cold, my skin is red and blue.

Maybe I’ll just sit down for a spell to catch my breath.

Who is that? Is it the Angel of Death?

I’m so sleepy, I’ll just rest here for a little while, that’s all.

Shallow breathing and cold air, what a downfall.

Now my body begins to freeze.

My soul, trapped forever by the evergreen trees.
