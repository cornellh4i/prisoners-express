**by Red Dot**

Did me dirty now it’s my get back, my revenge. My laughter picks up that gun with that special bullet, putting your brains on the porch steps. Damn what a mess. This is my laughter, or I can use the garrote. Out around your neck, pull life right out of you. Pull your soul out of your body. This is laughter. To skin you and cut your ears off, eyelids, nose, face. Screaming now, I got to cut the lips off. Haha, the lips aren’t making a sound in my fingers. Why is Red Dot laughing? Is he sick or demented? No, it’s only laughter. The crazy life of Red Dot full of laughter.
