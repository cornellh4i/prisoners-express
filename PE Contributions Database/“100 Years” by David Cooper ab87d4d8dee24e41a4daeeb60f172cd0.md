**“100 Years” by David Cooper**

****I grew up in the city, but my grandfather introduced me to fishing around age 6, and then one of my other’s boyfriends took us camping. I loved the outdoors early on, but I started getting older and came into my teens. I was too busy running with friends and chasing girls for a day of fishing or camping. Around this time, I started going in and out of jail.

The last time I was home in 2011, I was wanted and went on the run. I went all the way across the country to northwestern Montana, a place I’d never been. I didn’t know anyone, and I was on the U.S. Marshals’ Most Wanted list. At first, I was so stressed out and fell into a deep depression due to the fact I was sue I would never see daylight again once caught.

Right outside of Glacier National Park on a campground, I was staying in a tent then camper, a big change from my condo and expensive things I used to have.

After I was there for awhile, I began to enjoy myself and felt happy. When I would go into the remote wilderness or parks out there, I was happier than I’d ever been. These beautiful places changed my life--may have even saved it. I see this picture and am in places that are some of the most free places on earth. I’m sitting in one of the most unfree places.

I’m thankful for men that made this possible, like President Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir, especially John Muir.

With the Park Service turning 100 this year, I hope these places are protected and around forever, so future generations can enjoy them, and so they can bring happiness into others’ lives like they did me, even if it’s only for a short time. And someday, I will be able to breathe in that cool mountain air, smell the trees and flowers, and be surrounded by raw beauty you can only find in these wild places.
