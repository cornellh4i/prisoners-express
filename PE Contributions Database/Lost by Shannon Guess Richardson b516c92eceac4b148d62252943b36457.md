What does it mean to be lost? According to Webster Dictionary, it means, “no longer possessed on retained on no longer to be found.” Both definitions are quite accurate and hit home with men, but Webster is referring to being lost physically. I’m not. Physically, I know that I am in prison, sitting in my cell on my hard metal bed as I write this. It’s the rest of me that’s lost.

Prison is supposed to be about change and reform. It is supposed to take a supposedly broken person and shape them into someone who is ready to be released back into the world. That’s what it’s supposed to be, but for me, it is backwards.

I am a mother to six wonderful sons who are my entire heart and soul. Before my arrest, I had never been away from them for more than a couple of days. They were my world. I had never been in trouble before then I was arrested and put in prison.

My ex-husband refuses to let me contact my children. Although I write them often, I never receive a response. I have not spoken to my babies in three years. I don’t know anything about them anymore, or even if they are okay.

I was pregnant with my sixth son when I was arrested. I was twenty-two weeks pregnant. When I started bleeding, hurting, and crying, I was laughed at by guards while pads were thrown at me. My son was born at almost twenty-four weeks (four months early). I never got to hold him, see his sweet face, or tell him mommy loves him. I have a lawsuit against them now, but I am realistic in my expectations. I was served papers a while ago informing me he had been adopted.

My family have all abandoned me. Only one of my friends have contacted me. The rest have abandoned me.

Everything I had is gone. I have been left with nothing to my name, not even a scrap of clothing.

I have been broken. I’m not the woman I was. I don’t know who she is anymore. The fire I once had within me has sizzled out. That woman is nothing more than distant memory.

I feel left behind and forgotten by absolutely everyone, including God Himself. Yes, I know exactly what it means to be lost. I just wonder if I will ever be found.
