**“The Amazing Mr. Wiggles” by Jevon Jackson**

He was one of the most popular dogs on T.V. Mr. Wiggles had his own sitcom on NBC, millions of dollars in endorsement deals, and an astronomical number of followers on Instagram. Mr. Wiggles was part of the first litter of Jack Russell terriers that had been bred to talk. Just like a Lorrini parrot, the dogs could mimic human speech, but unlike any other animal, the dogs could be taught any language and learn to engage in meaningful conversations with human beings.

Mr. Wiggles became popular, not just because he could talk, but because of his personality. Charming and quick-witted, he was always a sought-after guest on the talk show circuit. He quickly became a trailblazer in being the first dog (and first non-human) in history to write, produce, and star in his own network-broadcast sitcom. Children loved Mr. Wiggles for his Tropical Crunch cereal commercials, where his tagline “Who stole my bowl?” was emblazoned on T-shirts and billboards across America. And adults loved Mr. Wiggles for his raunchy humor, where, in a Netflix series about gritty street life, he played a neurotic, germaphobic pimp who was always asking: “Bitch, you wash yo’ hands?” He even released a well-received Grammy-nominated album of Johnny Cash cover songs.

Being successful had become easy for Mr. Wiggles. Then everything came crashing down after the video was released online. A personal assistant of his secretly recorded an inebriated Mr. Wiggles making racist jokes about a cast member from his sitcom. Initially, Mr. Wiggles released a response video saying that the public outcry was “stupid” because dogs can’t be racist and that he was basically being set up by a disgruntled employee. When that response made matters worse, Mr. Wiggles hired a team of image consultants to do damage control for him.

Soon thereafter, an actress from the Netflix series, which Mr. Wiggles appeared in, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. The young, human actress alleged that Mr. Wiggles stumbled into her on-set trailer one afternoon, reeking of gin, and without her consent began violently humping her leg. He then sent a litany of unwanted text messages explicitly propositioning to “shine his bone.”

The reaction was swift–Mr. Wiggles was banned from entering the production lot where his own sitcom was filmed. Network executives replaced him with David Spade and Mr. Wiggles’ character was killed off. He lost all of his endorsements and quickly became a pariah in the Hollywood social scene. Then his owner called the police on Mr. Wiggles for attacking him, unprovoked, in the middle of the night.

Mr. Wiggles was placed in an animal shelter and he stayed there for what seemed like months with no one to come and claim him. Mr. Wiggles called everyone he knew, but no one would answer except for his personal accountant, Greg. And Greg had only more horrible news for him. Mr. Wiggles was bankrupt and owed over $1.3 million to creditors. When Mr. Wiggles, whimpering and almost crying, asked Greg if he would come claim him so he could get out of “doggy jail,” Greg said that his kids were allergic to dogs and hung up.

Although it was a no-kill shelter, the staff there considered euthanizing Mr. Wiggles. Since Mr. Wiggles’ arrival at the shelter, at least three staff had quit because of his callous attitude and berating comments–calling one volunteer a “slut bag” when she forgot to clean his bowl before feeding him. He complained incessantly about the food, his sleeping conditions, the temperature of the building, etc. They placed a muzzle on his snout, but that did little to silence him, as he soon learned to speak as ventriloquists do–speaking with minimal movement of his mouth.

When people came to the shelter to look for pets that they wanted to adopt, the staff kept Mr. Wiggles confined in a back room, isolated and out of earshot. One day, Mary visited the shelter to possibly adopt a pet for her and her husband, Paul. They were older now, and their grandkids were all off to college, so they both were looking for a reason to stay active. While looking at a cute little chocolate Labrador, Mary heard a sad, beautiful voice singing a bluesy slow version of Johnny Cash’s “Rusty Cage.” It came from behind a closed door nearby.

“I’m gonna break… I’m gonna break my… gonna break my rusty caaaaaage and run.”

She opened the door, shuffled inside, and saw only Mr. Wiggles sitting there alone in his cage. This was the pet she wanted to adopt. The staff there advised her against it, and cautioned her that he was a difficult animal. But Mary would hear none of it. Her mind was made up. She was taking him home. Johnny–her new name for him. Mr. Wiggles (Johnny) looked at it like a new beginning so he kept his mouth shut. He didn’t speak a word. They had no knowledge of his past, although Mary suspected she overheard him singing once. Nuzzling there in Mary’s lap, with Paul sitting next to her, Johnny felt like this was the closest thing to a loving family that he ever had. And it was an amazing feeling. Even better than fame, bright lights, and fortune.
