**“Wishes” by Shannon Richardson**

My wife and I are from India, and we moved to America a few years ago to start a family of our own. After a couple of years of trying, we finally welcomed our daughter into the world.

I was on top of the world. The happiest man you’ve ever met. I always had a smile on my face.

When my own daughter was a few months old, we took her back home to India for our families to meet her. It was a wonderful reunion. She was loved on and fussed over so much, I was afraid she would be spoiled for life. It was wonderful.

I went to pick my cousin up one evening when I spotted a stranger in trouble. Like any city in the world, there are parts of our city that are best avoided, especially at night. Unfortunately, it was in this part of the city where my cousin was staying. When I saw a man being bullied by two other men, I didn’t hesitate to help him. He looked at me with a smile in his eyes and told me, “To show my gratitude, I will grant you 3 wishes. Use them wisely, boy.” I laughed, but those wishes were all I could think about. Sure, I was happy, but there’s always more out there. Greed. It will get you every time.

When I laid down to go to sleep, I thought of the man and the wishes. I wondered what I really would wish for if I had 3 wishes. “Money. I wish for money,” I mumbled to myself as I fell asleep.

I was awoken to a telephone call. My parents were killed in a terrible accident during the night. I would find out later that day that I had inherited all that my parents had--and it was a lot.

I was once a drug addict, but I had been clean for years. The death of my parents brought back a craving so strong, I couldn’t think of anything other than scoring some drugs and feeling release. “Drugs. All kinds. A lot of them. That’s what I wish for,” I mumbled as I fell asleep.

I was awoken to a banging on the door in the middle of the night. An old friend of mine said he was in trouble. He said he needed to stash his drugs at my house for a while, but I could keep some for myself. The addict in me agreed, and I was doped up before my wife and daughter even woke up.

When my wife woke up and saw the state I was in, she told me she wasn’t going back to our old life. She told me she was leaving me. She packed up my daughter and left me. What did I do? More drugs, of course! Hey, they were there, so why not?!

In my desperation to numb the pain, I used way too much. Just when I thought I was about to die, I yelled out, “God, help me! I wish I had a different life.” That was when the police kicked the door in. It was a raid. I was taken to the hospital, where I was treated, then I went to jail, where I still sit.

This picture is all I have left of my wife and daughter. That’s me, the idiot who had a loving wife and a precious baby in front of him but was too busy thinking about wishes to notice.

Take it from me: live the life you have. Rock it! Love those who love you, and to hell with those who don’t. Don’t wish for more. You may just wake up and find that you’ve wished it all away.
