**“Kids in Chains” by Monica Vilom**

Told you,

Told you I’d follow you anywhere, even in these chains.

You can’t get away from me, I’m here to stay. We may not have much, just the shoes on our feet, bushy head; my love you’re staying with me.

We lost everything: house, cars, and clothes, but we have each other. You’ve got my hand to hold. I’m begging you, my love, please forgive me, we will rebuild, we will have all of the things we’ve lost, please cling to me, I’m in these chains, for now, my love, but it’s only temporary. In my heart your beauty is legendary, you’re the glue that holds us together, the yin to my yang. Please, my love, let’s stand together, so I can better endure these chains.

Don’t leave me begging on this sidewalk for the whole world to see.

We’ve lost it all already, let us have our dignity. Don’t leave me, darling, out in this cold. I told you darling you’re the only hand I’ll hold. Be kind now sugar, soon the sky will be blue, we will stand together this hun, I promise you.
