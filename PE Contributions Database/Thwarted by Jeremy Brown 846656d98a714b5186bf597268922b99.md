**“Thwarted” By Jeremy Brown**

So I used to play D&D (Dungeons and Dragons). We played for one year. A whole year straight. No problems. We spent six months making pieces, walls, trees, and doors out of tissue paper, water, glue, and toothpaste. We turned a two dimensional world into something more real and tangible. Our character pieces were faces of our favorite video game heroes: Zelda, Lord of the Rings elves, dragons. We had eight people play, four one day, four the other. We created our own campaign and stories and had to write everything down. It started to get too real because fights would start between people and things going on during game time. At first, it was verbal. Then it escalated into physical altercations. “Come on dudes it’s just an effing game, chill,” I would say. So after our first year of playing together, we all were thwarting each other’s initial happiness. What started out perfect devolved into something more animal in nature. It seems to me the human condition cannot grasp perfection yet, and when we achieve success, greed and power take over to put us back in Neanderthalism. O what horrors, where did our minds go?
