**The Man and the Cave by Roth Rathmann**

How long had it been? A couple, maybe ten days? Longer? It had been an explosive blur, literally. He felt and looked okay, but still, he could not quite put a finger on it, something was different. He rose to his feet, his body feeling its full weight. This cave, out of necessity, had been home.

He climbed a slight hill, temporarily losing his footing; regaining his balance by grasping onto exposed tree roots. Reaching the top, he stepped outside, brushing aside shrubs and dirt. He gazed upon his surroundings. The fresh air smelled great, a welcome respite from the dank mustiness of his cave. The trees, once lush, were barren. The sun, once a blinding yellow orb, was now a blend of peach and magenta. Perhaps the air quality had changed, casting a pall across the sky?

Everything had started as normally as ever for him one crisp early morning in Tahoe National Forest. It was his routine daily hike, the tail end of summer. Eduoard swore he could smell a harsh winter in the near future. The squishiness of moist dirt and pine needles beneath his boots was a welcome path. A skittish deer crossed his path, darting away once detected, while another, unaware of Eduoard’s awestruck stare, gingerly took a mouthful of berries from a nearby bush. Eduoard never took these moments for granted.

The land beneath trembled, causing him to nearly fall to the ground. He guessed it must have been an earthquake. Birds above fluttered Northward as did a whole flurry of other animals and critters. If it was good enough for them, he figured it was good enough for him - so he too ran. Up he went, deeper into the forest. He stole a glance backwards. The air appeared to be on his tail - a shimmering, filmy gust of light blues, greys, and pinks. A ringing detonation followed, knocking him to his feet and tumbling downward into darkness. He blacked out.

His lower back screamed. He had fallen twenty or thirty feet as far as he could tell. A beam of daylight illuminated the path he had fallen into. Had he dreamt all this? His stomach gurgled with hunger pangs, which only served to further motivate his fight to claw his way back to the surface. He was too dazed and weak to move, so he stayed put, sustaining himself on droplets of dew and rainwater, and, when desperate, on occasional rodents and beetles finding itself in the unlucky path of Eduoard. Days turned to nights, minutes to hours. Time ceased all meaning. Whatever mysterious power had zapped his strength paralyzing normal muscular movement. Standing up was a chore in futility, resembling a marionette with Mother Nature his cruel puppeteer.

With effort, muscle control returned. Time to delve into the reality of what happened. So there he stood, cave to his back, scanning an unproductive landscape void of the teeming life it once housed. In utter disdain, he trekked further up the mountain, finally reaching the crest overlooking the valley. Peering into the void, he stared in disbelief, as he collapsed to his knees.

“My God,” he uttered, as he wept.
