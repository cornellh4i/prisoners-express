**“See No Evil” by Joshua Balistreri**

The old woman was standing in front of me and staring at me intently. How she could see me at all through the glazed cataracts in her eyes, I had no idea. Neither did I know how she came to be standing in front of me and blocking my path.

We had been walking through the square. One of the great sights in the heart of the old city of Prague. So many things for tourists like ourselves to see. It was me and a few of my friends from college. We’d all put our money together so we could tour Europe for the summer. At that point, we were on the Eastern leg of our trek.

I had been eyes skyward admiring the old wonderful architecture when suddenly, she was there. At first glance, I thought she was just some elderly vagrant, but upon the infamous Gypsies I’d heard about. Some are thieves, but many more are street performers and in this case, or so I assumed, fortune tellers. If this was indeed what she was, she was not of the variety I imagined.

Now she stood in front of me. Had she been any taller, she’d have been only inches from my face. As our eyes met, it seemed as if time slowed to a standstill. The noise of the crowd faded, and it was only her and me. Slowly, she lifted her wrinkled, sun-darkened, beringed hand to her face and covered one eye.

“Why do you cover your left eye?” I asked her with my voice no more than a hoarse whisper. I had no doubt she heard me because she replied, “So I can not see the evil.”
