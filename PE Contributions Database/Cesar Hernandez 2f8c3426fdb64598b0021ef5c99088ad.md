**by Cesar Hernandez**

The first time I went to a professional salon was in high school, and before that, I went to a tiny place that was about ten by fifteen feet long. My haircut cost less than ten dollars. This guy at school kept talking about his great haircut, and he said he went to Toni & Guy. I knew Toni & Guy existed; it’s in most malls. It is a salon based out of London. I knew this dude was considered lame in middle school, so I didn’t think that he would buy an expensive haircut.

At this point, I can’t drive yet so somehow, I tricked mom into going to the mall at night. I drift away and go to Toni & Guy. I tell them I want to get a haircut. I am dressed expensively, but they still look at me stupid because I want a clipper haircut. They only cut with scissors. I have no idea that haircuts have different prices based on sex and the stylist’s education. Lacy is available and is an Art Director II. She washes my head and massages me. She keeps criticizing my bad haircut that I have gotten all my life so I’m a little put off. I get a GREAT haircut. When the cashier tells me it’s $45, I almost faint. Somehow, I missed to give Lacy a $10 tip.

The next day, the first thing I want to know is how that dude can afford such an expensive haircut. It turns out that his haircut was free because it was a new stylist. Toni & Guy give free haircuts when it is training new stylists. Over the years, I continued to go to Toni & Guy, due to the GREAT service. It wasn’t because of Lacy. On a scale of ten, I rate her attractiveness at 5. There were two locations that I frequented, depending if I was closer to home or the office. Usually I went to the one closer to the office since the mall is very high end. At that location, I had 3 different stylists. An Art Director I and II, and a Creative Director III.

My Art Director I was too stupid to make Art Director II so they freed her. My Art Director II was as cute as a button, but I only got two haircuts from her; I can’t remember why she left. The next time I needed a haircut, the receptionist was very helpful. She could tell I was disappointed and told me that Kent would be my new stylist. Kent is a Creative Director III and is the salon manager. You have to be VIP to get Kent to cut your hair. I don’t know how I got VIP, but now I upgraded to a $120 haircut. I could call at almost any time and get a haircut immediately. Usually, normal people have to wait at least a week. I would call Toni & Guy and ask for Kent. I would say I’m on the way, and he would be waiting. He always had the prettiest girl waiting to wash and massage my head. A few times, I overheard other clients say, “Who is that?” I always had a zero wait time. I got my haircut in my VIP area that only had one chair. I couldn’t see other clients, and they couldn’t see me. Often, Kent would make sure I had a glass of wine.

Kent’s wife also worked for Toni & Guy as a Creative Director I. She worked at the location that was inside a moderately high end mall. I got a haircut from her once when I was in the neighborhood. She found out Kent was my usual stylist so I felt obligated to pay her $125 for a haircut.
