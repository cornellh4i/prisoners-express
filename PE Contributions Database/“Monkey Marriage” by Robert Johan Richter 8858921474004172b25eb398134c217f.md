**“Monkey Marriage” by Robert Johan Richter**

****No, you cannot come to my wedding. What kind of insanity would ever drive me to marry a human woman? Ick! Women are slimy and disgusting. No, don’t assume or conclude that I’m gay, far from it. As repulsive as women are, men are worse. I don’t want to have any contact, sexual or otherwise, with any human being. To me, you are all nothing more than chittering monkeys, blindly obeying your animal instincts.

Are women intelligent, sentient, sapient, or even conscious? I used to think that women, like men, had a wide range of intellectual ability, from cowlike passive moronity to stunning brilliance, but I was wrong, so wrong. Over the last eight years, I have discovered that I am the only rational being on this planet, the only one able to use facts and logic to reach rational conclusions. Nobody else, male or female, has shown the tiniest glimmer of rationality.

Oh, what a cruel joke life is! My rational mind is trapped in a human brain, a brain wired with crude, animalistic, filthy, vile instincts. Some inner part of me, some unwanted base lizard brain, is actually aroused by the sight of human females. The horror! Imagine being sexually attracted to animals! That’s what women are, brutish rutting animals, driven by animal instincts, unthinking, unknowing, unaware. Am I a foul beast to couple with them? No!

And yet I have, to my eternal shame. I have mated with five women, reduced my shining existence to mere fuckery, compromised my integrity and given in to the animal urges rooted within my dysfunctional corpse's shell. Each time, I thought that I saw a *person* looking back at me, a mind staring out from her eyes into mine, so I did the considerate thing, the compassionate thing, the merciful thing, satisfied her physical desires as well as my own. The memories of these fetid couplings haunt me still. How could I lower myself so?

So no, you cannot attend my wedding, for it shall never come to pass. Would you marry a monkey? That’s what women are to me, animals, creatures, beasts, driven to mate, unable to reason why. How could I ever shackle myself to an unclean beast? Never, never I say, never shall I marry, never shall I attend a wedding. Your rituals mean nothing to me, and never will. Not one person, woman or man, has shown any true intelligence, any sign of thinking. No ritual means anything on its own.

Do I now say to the world “tell me if you are different, if you *think,* if you are more than just an animal! Tell me I’m not alone!” No, I do not, for what good would it do? Alone I am and alone I shall remain. Should I find, and wed, an “overwoman,” who is more than just meat, would our children be like us, or revert to the norm? We will never know.
