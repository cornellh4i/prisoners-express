Today is August 22, 2016. I just received my summer issue of the Prisoner Express newsletter. As I flipped through the pages, reading the articles, I came to the picture writing cue due September 1. I instantly thought this must be how I look when I think about a lot of things that are going on out there in society. And especially when I think about politics in this country.

If I was to describe myself, I’d say I am a good, ol’ country boy at heart. I served in the United States Army and got injured during my service, receiving an honorable discharge under medical conditions. I am a patriot of our country.

But I now sit in a 6x10 solitary confinement cell because I’ve made some very poor choices in my life. After receiving injuries and the discharge, I was dealing with a lot of personal issues. I was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Regardless of what I had been through or what I was diagnosed with, no matter what the surrounding circumstances were, I still made some poor choices. And that led to my current circumstances.

I sit in this tiny cell and watch the news and read the newspapers. When I see everything that’s going on out there in society, I picture myself looking crazy like this picture (LOL). Because it is truly so sad and scary to see where our country is heading! I see the cops killing unarmed human beings. I see people killing the cops. Because of everything going on, I see black people protesting since a black person was killed by a cop. The black lives matter group.

Then we can talk about terrorism and terrorists such as ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and other Islamic extremist groups who hate Christianity and Western civilization. There is so much hatred out in the world!

Whether it’s abroad or right here in the USA, have you ever wondered why there is so much hatred in the hearts of mankind? I can’t give you an easy answer--it’s taken years and years for everything to get so messed up! But what is amazingly astounding to me is the fact that a lot of people feel like nothing is wrong at all.

We have homeless people, unemployed people, and starving kids living in poor conditions--right here in America. And yet we want to open the borders and let hundreds of thousands, millions of immigrants come here. I understand not all of these people are bad, and many are running for their lives from even worse places in the world such as South America and the war-torn Middle East.

I just don’t understand what “Washington” is thinking about or what they are doing. There are people like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who are running for president. Both who are terrible choices for our country, and both have billions together for campaigning, but yet kids are starving and veterans are homeless. People are unemployed.

Then I think about slavery. Slaves and slavery were abolished in America, but what do you call the American Prison system? You have hundreds of thousands of prisoners across our country, and we are forced to work in prison in many different jobs. From the license plate factory to uniforms for military and office equipment for state offices, we get paid next to nothing! $9, $16, $22 a month, for as much as 16 hours a day for 7 days a week. If you refuse to perform your work duties, they write you tickets and put you on different restrictions. So ask yourself, is slavery really over? Clearly the answer is no! For a man or woman who “broke the law” to work these hours and not receive enough money to pay for basic hygiene items is wrong. Then people say well, it offsets what you don’t pay for (food, electricity). Living in prison teaches you nothing about being a successful member of society.

With everything going on around me, I want to hide my eyes so I don’t see it.
