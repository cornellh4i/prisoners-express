**"Love" by Calvin Carter**

Man, what can I tell anybody about love? Not very much... as love has not been very good to me. Then too, maybe it's me that has not been good to love.

Even family-love is an effort. You have to put something in to receive. But my real point is that everybody on some level wants to be loved. It may not last forever as we would like it to, As I have loved many people and animals as well as objects. People have left me behind, dogs have died, and cars have broken down. So always start with the one you see in the mirror.
