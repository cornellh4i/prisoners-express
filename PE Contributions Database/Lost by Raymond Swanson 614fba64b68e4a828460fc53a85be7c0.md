My Aunt Frances died yesterday at the age of 70. She was my favorite aunt by far and the only aunt to communicate with me during my incarceration.

Frances was the oldest of four children, born in the mid-1940s. She had long made the days bright before I was born, with her infectious smile and a laugh that would make you laugh just hearing it. Some of my earliest memories include a Thanksgiving dinner with a big family in her small two-bedroom house, her picking me up for a long weekend in her white convertible, and comforting me one night I felt alone and scared. Along with my mother, she helped me accept people based on more than what’s on the outside.

Approximately two years ago she began a battle with cancer, which she won. She was deemed cancer-free by her doctor about a year ago. But ongoing were her kidney troubles and just recently her liver began to shut down. I talked to her about three weeks ago and she laughed and joked like she always did, giving me the usual updates. She told me she was tired of the nursing home and just wanted to go home. I told her I was doing okay, we said our “I love you’s,” and hung up.

My favorite uncle, her husband of 41 years, spent Valentine’s Day at her side and shortly after getting home got the call that she had passed on. I was lucky enough to have gotten ahold of him today, and we shared some heartfelt time on the phone. I didn’t get to know her as much as I wish I had. We always wish we knew more about people after we can’t. We always wish we had more time. I’ve learned the hard way what happens when we put off telling people how we really feel about them. I’ve lost friends and neighbors, but prior to yesterday (today is when I found out), I’ve never had to go through the lost feeling of losing a true loved one while in prison.

To you, my brothers and sisters I’ll never meet, I thank you for writing and keeping me intrigued with your writings. Keep your heads up, and let’s appreciate what Gary and Prisoner Express are offering us. We write because we aspire to be better writers, maybe published writers even. But we also write to inspire. We don’t want our future to follow our footsteps and come into these places.

How do you mourn in a place where you have to be a manly man? My eyes watered as my uncle broke down and talked of putting my aunt’s urn on the mantle. I’ve never seen the man cry, but hearing him I could hardly hold myself together. I promised him a future lunch at the local diner and told him something I can never remember telling him: I love you.
