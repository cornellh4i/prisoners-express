**“When life gives you frozen cake, make it into breakfast” by Cesar Hernandez**

My wife and I would go to Cheesecake Factory primarily for the chocolate cake. They had this seven chocolate cake or something. It was a chocolate cake. It had chocolate frosting, chocolate sprinkles, chocolate shavings. It had several different kinds of chocolate.

On one occasion we got the whole cake. We had no idea if it was made on the premisses or if it was made elsewhere. We called three days in advance. The cake costs ninety dollars. It weighs thirteen pounds and has about forty dollars worth of chocolate. To a certain extent, the high price is justifiable.

I go to pick it up. The pretty little brunette has no idea what I’m talking about. She has no record of my cake being ordered. She goes to the back. She says they forgot to pull my cake out of the freezer. It is frozen solid and she asks if I still want it. The manager comes up and apologizes for not making sure that my cake had been taken out of the freezer. The brunette is so pretty I give her a ten dollar tip even though she deserved no tip.

My wife was in the car and asks what took so long. I explain everything. We put the cake box on the floor and turn on the heater floor vents to high. We were hoping that by the time we got home it would be defrosted.

At home we tried a steak knife and it would not cut the frozen solid cake. We left the cake out on the counter overnight. In the morning we had Cheesecake Factory chocolate cake for breakfast. Between the two of us we ate about a quarter of the chocolate cake. The whole thirteen pound cake was eaten in three days.
