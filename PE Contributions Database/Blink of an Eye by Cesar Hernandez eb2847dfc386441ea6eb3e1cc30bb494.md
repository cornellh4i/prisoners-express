**Blink of an Eye by Cesar Hernandez**

In the blink of an eye a person could die. I can think of three instances where I could have died.

I was racing another car down the highway. I see a cop car in the opposite direction slowing down and about to cross the grass median. I know the cop is coming for us for going eighty miles per hour in moderate traffic. The other car doesn’t see the cop. I basically slide off the highway at the last possible moment. When I take the exit there is only about one foot in front of me. I could have hit the concrete barrier and died.

The second time I could have died was also on the highway. I couldn’t sleep so I went for a drive at night in the pouring rain. I’m speeding as usual. My Cadillac hydroplanes in a puddle of water I didn’t see. The stability control tries to take over and I hit the brakes. When I finally stop I am about six meters away from the concrete barrier I almost hit head on. I decide to go home even if I can’t sleep.

The third time I almost died, I was crossing the street. I was drunk. I am trying to cross a major intersection. I am drunk so I don’t pay attention to my surroundings. I am waiting for the walk sign to turn on. On my left, there is a car speeding. It was absolutely no intention of stopping. I don’t see it. The light for the car turns red and my walk sign turns on. I immediately step off the curb and pay no attention. I still don’t pay attention fully but I can hear brakes screeching, trying to stop. Then I hear lots of curse words. I don’t even look back at the car. Later on when I sober up I realized I could have gotten hit by that car, that had full intention of running the red light.
