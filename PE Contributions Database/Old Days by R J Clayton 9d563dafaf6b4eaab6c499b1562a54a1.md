A person used to be able to smoke in prison. They used to have pornography. We used to have basic cable with all the channels you could get in the world, with basic cable. We don’t have any of those anymore. Not within the Texas prison system. Can you guess why? I’ll give you a hint. It’s religious.

We the people, now known as the incarcerated citizens of the not-so-great state of Texas, have been oppressed by religious fanatics that have stampeded the institutions of our homeland. The goal, one of them, is to purge the savages of all that is unholy, that they may come to find salvation through our maker. In the mind of these self-proclaimed purifiers, we are all soulless. Does that remind you of anyone? I’ll give you a hint. White-speckled grey-people discovered them.

Years ago, an inmate set out to file a lawsuit regarding the issue of secondhand smoke causing cancer. Specifically giving him cancer, because prison is an indoor activity. What he failed to mention was, there are ventilation shafts on all units that suck out air, and keep a steady cycle. Another thing, tobacco is legal all over America, including Texas. Texas cigarette companies have never been sued for causing cancer. No Sir! They were sued, drumroll, for lying to congress.

Since tobacco is legal in America and Texas, we should be allowed to smoke outside. At least that. Especially since that lawsuit was riddled with so many mistakes. Don’t believe me? I got three words for you. Open Records Act. It went through anyway.This was all due to the fact that it was pushed through red tape.

An offering was collected to help it pass, something still being done, and State representatives acted on behalf of their church members. It was the zealot mindset that planted the seeds that sparked the birth of the monster, one born with so many defects. It has spiraled out of control since the religious people are mad. This had brought me to believe that I am going to be executed because of religious persecution. Do you remember that in Social Studies class? I’ll give you another hint. It’s why our ancestors came over here to discover all reds, in the olden days.

The state of Texas passed a law outlawing pornography within the prison system. Lawmakers got us cable that was strictly basic, then religious people mandated that we should only have certain channels. We get: ESPN1, ESPN2, TBS, USA, TNT. We get five channels that are Christian, one spanish channel, and syndicated networks like:NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox. In other words, what televisions come with. They did all this within prison walls. Can you guess how that happened? Another hint. Whenever a person helps out for free.

On every unit in the entire Texas Department of Criminal Justice, they have faith based ways. At least one in which you must be trying to better yourself, but they want the betterment to come strictly by way of religion, their religion. You kind of have the choice, but you’re not allowed to choose: paganism, wicca, Adversary, etc. These are all established religious practices. Go to TDCJ.com.

Christianity is the religion that rules the roost. The program is based on, and in the realm of, that particular standard. Volunteers control the inmates that follow their own particular guidelines of that faith. Then, those inmates, that follow their own particular guidelines of that faith, control other incarcerated citizens in turn. All using the tell-on-them system. Seriously? Everything on that wing is highly regulated by inmates. Will you believe that?

The television must be off for meetings. You can’t order certain magazines. Many TV shows:sitcoms, movies, soap operas, and even talk shows, may never be viewed. People in other wings can have all those things. If a prisoner moves into that wing, they lose all of those privileges except for magazines and books.

Perhaps prison guards only do things out of necessity. More than any other life on the planet combined. Hundreds of millions of dollars. Most of which was paid for by Christian Church Congregations. We’re made from this. A lot of that was under the table payments. Bribes came forth from the little tax-free, give me, fundraiser box. An entire black market has been created along with a streamlined snitch system. Some guards bring in cigarettes and porn for billfold money. When an inmate tells on them, they get a promotion

So everybody wins right? No! Because it’s racial profiling at its best. You see, Christians are majority speckled gray. Catholics are hispanic. Blacks are muslim, and Asian people are Taoist. There are Native Americans and Jewish faiths, but they have it hardest of all. The prison officials they are looking to bust come from the cities.

Ideas are but forms of data, and information is the only thing that can keep the government in charge in working, not necessarily viable, economy. So the snitch program was instituted by the religious dorms. It is a new age slavery. The system is racist. If a white christian pleads insanity, they are unfit to stand trial. The only reason you can’t persecute christians is because they can’t tell each other apart.

Perhaps, the good old days have come and gone. Maybe I’ll be murdered for not being a particular prayer group’s cup of tea. I have been locked up for fifteen years. I’ve seen a lot of religious discrimination. I’ve seen even more racism.I haven’t seen much sexism. Texas is sexist though. When a certain woman becomes president, Ephraim and Menashe shall part.
