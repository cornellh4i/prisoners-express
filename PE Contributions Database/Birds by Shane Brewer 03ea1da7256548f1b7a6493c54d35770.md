***Birds* by Shane Brewer**

Fly away to another place. The world is vast and big, so much to see and little to do. The smells and touch of other cultures. They talk different, smell weird, and even get me oddly, but I’ll say hi and shake their hand and tour their beautiful country. We talk about good, bad, funny times. The great thing is I’ll be gone by morning to visit the next place like a bird.
