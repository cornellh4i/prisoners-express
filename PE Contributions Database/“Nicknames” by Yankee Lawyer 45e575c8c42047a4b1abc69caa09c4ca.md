**“Nicknames” by Yankee Lawyer**

Sometimes, you can tell a lot about a person from his name. My name is Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr. Name dictionaries consistently say “Robert” means “Brilliant Valor.” What is brilliant valor? I’ve been trying for over a half century but still can’t wrap my mind around it. Brilliant valor? If a deer is crossing the road, and I shine my valor in its eyes, will it freeze?

Andrew is a Biblical name. He was the Apostle who recruited most of the others. He was Simon Peter’s brother. He didn’t get much glory, but he apparently did a lot of the work behind the scenes.

My father was Joseph Martin Bartlett, Sr., AKA Joe. His brother was Ephraim, AKA Eph. If they had another brother, the poor guy might have been a Manasseh. Mercifully, the other siblings were all girls.

My oldest brother was J. Martin Bartlett, Jr., AKA Marty. Joe was taken.

One of the young men in the Boy Scouts troop my church sponsored was Richard, Jr., but I don’t know his middle name. His mother called his father and him Big Dick and Little Dick. She never seemed aware of the stifled laughter that caused.

My friends and family called me Robby. Once in awhile, my brother Alan Thomas (like me, had a European first name and a Biblical middle name) addressed me as Robert Andrew. If my mother called me that, I was in trouble.

Nowadays, I go by Bob. It’s a short name and easy to say, hear, and spell. Very efficient. But for some internet purposes, I used to go by handles like Noshoes and Yankee Lawyer. I still use Yankee Lawyer as a penname for some of my books and articles.

I do not go by my initials or any number I am a human being with a name. Guards like to call prisoners by our last names without saying “Mister.” It’s a common gesture of disrespect among bigots in the Jim Crow South, and I demand certain courtesies. I am, after all, a Yankee Lawyer. You can tell a lot about a person from his name.
