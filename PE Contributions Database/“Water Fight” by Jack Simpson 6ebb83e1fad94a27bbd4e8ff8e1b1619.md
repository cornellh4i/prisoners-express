**“Water Fight” by Jack Simpson**

I love the hot summer days. The feel of the hot breeze on my sunburnt skin. Who has time to think about skin cancer at the age of twelve?

My brother is older than me by at least eight years. He is a holy terror. If playing fair is in the game, you can count him out. His idea of fair play is to make sure you suffer, and I mean hard.

Our backyard is level by no means. I had to run uphill, blinded by the burst of water, only to slip and fall to his mercy. There is no telling how much water is wasted. The worst part of this is, we had to explain to our father why we had the water running for so long.

When you are young, nothing sinks in about how much things cost, that our parents paid the bills. All that really mattered was that we were having fun.

I thought the coast was clear. Did I ever figure that wrong? My bucket was full to the point of having a hard time toting it. My face had just breached the corner of the house. It felt as if a monsoon hit me all at once. I couldn’t see anything. It felt as though my eyelids were peeled back and my hair left its home, never to return. On my knees and begging him to stop only brought more trouble. The harder I begged, the more he let me have it. I’ve been told nothing is tighter than a brother’s love. Boy did he love his younger brother. If this was his way of showing love, I believe we both would have done better fighting it out. It didn’t take long before our mother stepped in.

“You know your father will be home soon. This mess had better be cleaned up,” she said. Nobody talked back to Mama. She had our utmost respect. Our mess was cleaned up and on the back porch sat a bucket of water. I will not lie, it was mine. That was just in case he tried another sneak attack.

What is that old saying? “Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me”. I must have been the most shamed person in our family. He sure got me more than twice and I was talking about just anything.

The door opened slowly. Was he ready for a truce? Deep down my mind had second thoughts. I grabbed the bucket of water. When I turned to give a full roundhouse motion, the water had already started to leave the bucket. If only you saw the fear on my face. It was too late to stop or turn.

Our dad caught the full force of water and looked madder than a wet hen. The thing that caught me off guard was that my brother was just standing to his left about ten feet away. One of the biggest grins on his face. 	I knew I was in deep trouble. Dad was soaked from his head to his waistline. All I could do was say I was so sorry. I was expecting more from him other than what he gave me. Slowly he went inside. My brother was laughing so hard. I wanted to do something. My bucket was still in my hand. The water flowed easily into it. As I turned to throw it on him, there stood our father with a bucket full of water. He looked at me and grinned. Now, I have seen that grin before.

We both nodded at the same time. My brother was soaked from head to toe. That was funny to Dad. My brother was going out on a date in less than twenty minutes. He had to change clothes and start all over again.

My dad laughed at him and said, “Don't mess with the man, who is the master of water fights.” We both laughed as he went inside. I hugged my dad and thanked him for standing by me. His only comment was: “That is what fathers do.”
