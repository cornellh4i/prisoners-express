Listening to 2 Pac and screaming “I don’t give a ****!” I have the tattoos and previous prison sentence to prove I’m a “gangster.” It was juvenile, and unfortunately, it was my state of mind. I thrived on having no fear, which was a major mistake.

About 11 years back, I was 26 years old and a new father to a beautiful baby boy. Dominic was 2 months premature, weighed 3.2 lbs. and faced many difficulties during his first month in the NICU. On my way to visit, I got the dreadful call: “Your son crashed.” What does that mean?

The fear was instant and all consuming. Totally debilitating. The universe put me in my insignificant place that day. I stood in the little room where you scrub yourself down prior to entering the NICU. Through the door I could see a team of nurses and doctors working on Dominic. I was paralyzed. Visiting was held up, and in a room full of parents, my fears ran down my face.

As soon as they got his heart going, they would attempt to intubate him. His heart heat and oxygen would plummet, and so back to compressions and a blow bag. This routine went on for 15 months, and for the first time, I knew fear. I was helpless and horrible: I’d do anything to trade places with my little buddy, yet all I could do was stare with my heart in my throat.

To say you have no fear is a catch phrase. It sounds good. But it’s without merit. I know fear, and I’m still shaken when I conjure up the memory.

Dominic is now 11 years old and my best friend. He’s an angel, my angel. And dealing with this sentence is a problem since knowing I let him down breaks my heart.
