**O’Leary Church by Jack Simpson**

My family hailed from Scotland generations ago. I am the fifth generation of O’Leary’s. I had been told the history of the church. The older generation attended it. The stones were hewn and placed in by hand.

One thing I had always wanted to do was visit my heritage so that I could understand my family history better. I wanted to stand on the hollow grounds where my family once stood.

I am the last of my family. My father passed away a few years back. I am the only son that is left. My first name is Thomas, and it was given to me at birth. Thomas Sean O’Leary. Isn’t that a mouth full? I do have one thing in common with the others. I have blue eyes and a stocky build. I love to spend countless hours listening to old stories about Scotland.

My father was the best storyteller of them all. His way with words would captivate the attention of any listener. The ghost stories were the best for me. He always ended up at the O’Leary’s church. I sometimes wondered if all of this was true or not. He gave me my first name after doubting Thomas in the bible.

When I turned thirty-three, I boarded a plane for Scotland. Two-weeks of nothing but pure venture. I really wanted nothing more than to visit the church and see the headstones for myself. When we landed the sky was cloudy and a little rain was falling.

The cottage was nice and seemed like the period I heard so much about. I would visit the cemetery later the next day. I found myself relaxing on the bed which felt comfortable and soon was sound asleep. When I woke later that evening I was feeling a little hungry. Venturing outside and to get a breath of fresh air. I found a small tavern which sold ale. When I stepped through the door, it felt like I had been there before. I walked over to the little bar that was really small. A voice greeted me: “ what will you have Laddy?” Before I could think I said “ Brandy will do it.” When he brought it to me, I paid for it and thanked him. I turned and noticed all the people were standing holding their drinks up in the air. Before it could touch my lips, I sat it down. Realizing I don’t drink alcohol.

Pictures lined the wall and as I slowly walked toward them, I had seen some of these before. My eyes couldn’t lie to me. Not only was my father there and his father’s father. The entire O’Leary generation was hanging in a circle as if I didn’t know better. In the center was the church in all her glory.

I turned and wiped tears from my eyes because I had seen and rubbed trembling fingers over each one. One of the men handed the Brandy I had just bought and I raised my glass to the ceiling. Others did the same and one older man said I finally got to meet an O’Leary before I passed away. I tossed the Brandy down the back of my mouth. It burned like the Dickens. I felt hands slapping my back as I gasped for air. For once I felt as if I belonged. I was finally home for good.
