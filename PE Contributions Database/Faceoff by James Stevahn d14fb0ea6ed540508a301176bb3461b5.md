**Faceoff by James Stevahn**

Their eyes locked. The lines were drawn. The sides chosen. It came down to these last two gentlemen. On one side, you had Senator Majority Leader Mary McHosen, the other the honorable John Carloni. The silence could cut a soul. The Senator was the first to cede. He looked down at his notes then nodded to the projectionist. A photo of three college guys who were passed out on a couch, liquor bottles, beer cans, and partially full glasses laid the background appeared on the screen.

“Judge Carloni, do you recognize this picture?” Caroloni smirked, that look won him with the public and those who helped him to this point.

“Judging by the picture, I was passed out, so obviously not.” Those in attendance laughed all except Carloni and McHosen. Carloni knew by this picture they were grabbing at straws, any straws to discredit him.

“Mr. Carloni, need I remind you of the seriousness of these proceedings?”

“Sorry Senator.” He wasn’t. “I just don’t see the relevance of this picture has to do with these SERIOUS proceedings.” The cryer shown by the Senator’s face was building.

“This photo Mr. Carloni, shows lack of judgement, lack of control, and alcoholism, just to name a few things. These are not qualities of a Supreme Court Justice.” The Senator smiled. He thought he had him.

Carloni straightened his tie and leaned towards the microphone. “Senator, that picture was taken when I was eighteen or nineteen years old. I was a young, immature college kid. I assume they had colleges in your day and I don’t know how they did it in your day, but college kids do drink and party, that’s a fact, some pass out.” He smirked again. “Some even throw up on the Dean’s front porch. Wouldn’t you agree, Senator?” Carloni knew that McHosen was his one big hurdle to be elected to the vacant Supreme Court seat. He also believed in doing his homework.

The Senator’s face went as white as a ghost. “Mr… Mr. Carloni, these proceedings are about you and your past, not speculating and avoiding the issues.”

“Exactly, Senator.” McHosen looked confused. “People, especially young people, do things in college, smart things and stupid things from time to time. As in regard to this feeble attempt to discredit me as a Federal Judge and as Candidate to our highest and prestigious court. I say this, was that me passed out in that photo? Yes. Was it a lack of judgement and control on my part? Yes.

However, like MOST people, I matured. Find any other picture or report of me abusing anything, any drug, that you’ll not find. I realized from that night, I really don’t like to drink. I’m not judging YOUR character if you do. I’m now fifty-eight years old. I take my judgeship seriously. I don’t stoop to gutter levels to see things done.

I judge according to the letter of the law. I know we have some tough laws to look at. I assure you, Senator, and any other who may doubt. I will read every word of those laws and amendments before I bring my verdict. I will be but one voice among those other justices. They have to vote on issues as they will. If you have anything else to discredit me, then by all means, let’s waste more of the taxpayers’ money. Taxpayers and their money that elected you and bought that fancy suit you’re wearing and that shiny BMW I saw you pull up in this morning.”

The room was silent. All eyes were on the Senator. He knew that Carloni had one-upped him. If he said more then to the people, Carloni was right and it would come back to haunt him next year in the elections. Ending his questioning was the only “honorable” way out of this. We knew this and by that smirk, so did Carloni.

“I have no further issues at this time.” They voted the following week 17-3 appointing the Honorable Judge Carloni to the Supreme Court.
