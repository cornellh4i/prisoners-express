**“Shaking of Faith” by Jeffery L. Spurgeon, Jr.**

You can’t imagine or even come close to understanding the thoughts that go on in my mind. I am a criminal in more ways than I care to admit. I am a victim of crimes I am ashamed to tell. You do not know the cause of the scars you can see, what about the ones you cannot see?!

Why do you judge me? Why oh why do you look down upon me because I am in prison? I was convicted of murder at nineteen years old and arrested at eighteen years old.

I have come not to tell you about God’s love for you but rather to tell you about the love you should have for others. Oh Bible believing people let me disturb what you’ve been taught for so many years. Every character of the Bible is a criminal in some way. Even God himself. Ouch. That one is a hard one to swallow.

God looked down upon man and destroyed everyone except the few he felt should live. God says, “I will have mercy on whomever I want to.” Go to your Bible and find me a character in there who would not be convicted of a crime if they were to be alive today.

See the problem with mankind today is that they believe what they are told rather than going and researching for themselves. Read your Bible from front to back and find me one character who is not a criminal, Jesus included.

Don’t adjust the Bible to fit your lifestyles. Don’t adjust it to make you feel better about yourself. The Bible does not explain everything. It does not have all the answers that your Sunday school teacher taught you. I’m sorry to believe in myself and not the Bible.

Have I shook you a little? If you believe the Bible and all it says, then why don’t you obey it? Why don’t you love everyone and lend to all those in need? Oh what hate you have for the people in prison. Thou of little faith.

The Bible, the words you believe in, were written and based upon the lives of criminals. I have not come to turn brothers against fathers or mothers against daughters as Jesus did. I am a man of true love who desires peace and the restoration of relationships of people kind.

Jesus says you can do all things through him. I tell you today out of true faith in myself, You, child, can do all things if you believe in yourself. Look at our world, where do you think all this destruction stems from? I tell you the truth, it is because of man made religions.

We have lost faith in ourselves and in each other because of religious teachings. Especially the Bible who says you can do whatever you want because you will be forgiven. Lie, cheat, steal, kill, it doesn’t matter, you are forgiven. But you do not forgive even when your religion commands you to.

I also got news for you, God was a God of love, forgiveness, healing, compassion, way before the New Testament was written. You can throw a man in prison for the rest of his life with no mercy and no conscience because God will take care of it. I’m sorry to tell you that goes against the Bible.

The Bible preaches forgiveness, love. Don’t forget those in prison; don’t just love those who love you but love everyone, even your enemies. Oh… that’s too hard. “I’ll just put that to the side, God will understand,” but that’s not what the Bible says. God says, “If you do not forgive others, God will not forgive you.”

Our country needs restoration, our country needs hope, it needs each other, needs you. We have to build each other up. Love each other. Create a foundation for our children. So our children can grow up in a peaceful, loving world.

We not only need to have more respect for others but most importantly we need to have more respect for ourselves, our bodies, our futures. How can we respect others if we can’t respect ourselves!

Religion is a fog that we all must emerge from. These are my thoughts and beliefs, you do not have to believe in what I am telling you obviously. But once you get out (emerge from) that fog (religion) and start putting faith back in yourselves, others, and the world around you then you will be able to stand on something solid.

You won’t have to worry about your prayers going unanswered, question your faith, or whether or not God loves you. I tell you today, this is the truth, I love you. How can I love someone I don’t know? Because you are a human being, and it is in my nature to love you. You are very special, strong, and unique.

That is why I love you. And if you let go of religion and grasp mankind as a whole you will also love your neighbor because he/she is a person and deserves to be loved and treated with kindness and compassion.
