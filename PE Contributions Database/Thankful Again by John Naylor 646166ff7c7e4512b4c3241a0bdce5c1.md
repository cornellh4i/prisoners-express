**“Thankful Again” by John Naylor**

It’s always nice to be grateful—to dwell or meditate on what you’re thankful for. How god has blessed our lives. How fortunate we are to be in prison in America and not North Korea.

When I was a kid, my mom would cut out these large feathers out of construction paper. We would draw the feather’s veins and write what we were thankful for on it.

Now I’m thirty-four and in prison for 120 and ½ years. If I got all the good time, it would be halved because I’m under Indiana’s old law. I don’t accept that frate though. I still try to remember what to be thankful for and fight to defend my constitutional rights while encouraging others to do the same.

I’m thirty-four, but my mother still gets a letter every November entitled, “Turkey Feathers.”

I encourage you to try it. Send the letter to someone you care about a lot. Start a new tradition. Hopefully they’ll do the same and then you’ll know what they’re thankful for. It’s a good-attitude tradition. It’s something out of the ordinary here amongst the negativity.

And you can be different! You can do what someone may never have done for you. Encourage the person to keep a good perspective and count their blessings.
