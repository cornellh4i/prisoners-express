**“Flowers” by Jack Simpson**

To most people, flowers are given as a symbol of love. Once out, they live their cycle and wilt. They end up in the trash. To some, they are just a plant with no purpose. Now let’s look at it in a different point of view. They have no heart, yet they live. They do breath, but have no lungs. They circulate living fluid, which is not blood. So they are a living plant, they feel pain. (All done by a study).

The plants we grow here are done in a controlled environment. The seed is planted in the potting soil, in a temperature controlled at 70 degrees. For three to six days the seeds germinate through the soil. Then and only then does the life cycle of the flower begin. In a month’s time we have a flower with leaves, which will soon bloom.

The walkways here are filled during the Summer months with all types of flowers that fill the air with a sweet aroma. It gives a sense of being close to home. I myself have been around flowers and gardens all my life. There is something special about planting, tending, placing the flowers in someone’s hand who is a shut in. To see the smile on an elderly person’s face. It not only lets them know that someone cares, but also that they have not been forgotten. It is something they will enjoy until it finally reaches its cycle’s end.

The plants need watering, and we are today’s method. Once the soil looks like a day pattern, we water the plants from the bottom. This lets the water be soaked up from the bottom. Once the top looks dark black it is time to remove it out of the water to let it drain, then place it back to gain strength in the area it was in to start with. (Aloe is done the same).

My mother, sister, and I used to plant flowers around our house when we were small. I never remembered what they were until last year. My sister reminded me that they were “Holly Hocks and Purple Hearts.” Purple Hearts will come back each year once they die out. I guess I have a green thumb, because what I plant will grow and I have been very successful with it. It is hard to do it by hand and produce enough food to feed our starving world.

I really like the old saying that has been around longer than myself. When you feel that life is moving too fast, “you have to stop and smell the roses.” Not everyone will stop and do that in life. Food for thought. Remember flowers are living, breathing plants. They brighten up our prison as well as brighten up a person’s eyes. Share a smile, share a flower. Here are just a few flowers we grow: Petunia, Coleu, Impatients, Snap Dragons, Susie Orange, Marigolds, Danthus China Mix, and Holly Hock mix.
