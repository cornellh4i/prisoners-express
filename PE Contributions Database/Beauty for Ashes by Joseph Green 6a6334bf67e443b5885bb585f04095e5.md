**Beauty for Ashes by Joseph Green**

...We rejoice ****in our suffering… ...

Age four:

“*Tyler*, you little shit! Where are you? Get the fuck our here!” My mom’s boyfriend screams while I lie hiding under my bed, clothed only in my sister’s underwear, confused and terrified.

I am nourished

Age six:

I weep as my home retreats through the back window of my mom’s ‘79 Pontiac Formula.

I am nourished

Age six to nine:

We moved four times in three years .

I am nourished

Age fourteen:

Friction with my step father prompts me to call my dad, “ hey, do you think I could live with you?”  Dad is playing step father to his girlfriends kids; one girl and one boy, mirroring my sister and me- whom he ignores. “Sorry kid, we just don’t have room.”

I am nourished

Age fifteen:

Coming through the door into the Neonatal Intensive Care unit. My girlfriend and I see tiny Justin lying on a table, chest heaving, limbs convulsing, shuddering… dying.

I am nourished

Age nineteen:

I am awakened by rapid knocking on the motel door. “Uncle Ed! What are you doing here?” “ I need you to get dressed and come with me; I’ll explain everything in the car.” In the car he says, “your mom’s being airlifted to the hospital. She has a brain aneurysm.”

In the waiting room, I realize we are directly under the NICU where Justin fought, and I quietly acknowledged the counterpoint.

The doctor enters and I see my mother being pulled away like my home through the back window of that old Pontiac.

And I am nourished

Nourishment is that which sustains life and promotes growth.

Suffering - when we’re in its midst, we swear it’s killing us. Looking back on the most painful events of my life, however, I see it was the terror-stricken heart of a confused, abused boy that feeds the fiery passion to be an ember of change in this dark, cold world today. And that pitifully dependent adult child would never have ventured to join the path to becoming a man had not his enabling mother been torn from his infant grasp.

“ ….suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and

character produces hope…”

Nothing is so nourishing as hope. Hope is that great element of the human spirit that resists the oppressive tyrants which war against the instinct to persevere. Without hope we are lost. And hope finds its conception in suffering. Without suffering, we could not know endurance. It is endurance of trials that builds character. Only those with character possess the hope to survive.

When was the last time you embraced suffering, scarfed it down like a starving vagrant at a buffet? The thought is intensely counter-intuitive, but those who’ve dared to, have to set their corners of this world ablaze with purifying fires.

“ Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the Earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.

These probing words, uttered by a man who, more than any other, leaned into suffering- reveal a painful truth so obvious we see it daily without note: growth requires death. The nourishment of all living bodies demands the suffering of lesser biological agents. In a relative way, the nourishment of the spirit demands that mind and body suffer.

The spirit is the apex of the human construct and the physical and emotional suffering we endure nourishes that immortal facet of our being. It’s painful when we are confronted by difficult trials; but so is it painful to plants and animals when they are cut down. Painful but necessary.

On the eve of His execution, Jesus said something thoughtful that hearts will find haunting, *“If anyone serves me, he must follow me…”*  This same Jesus- speaking through the prophet- said: *“I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; I hid not my face from disgrace or spitting. I have set my face like a flint. Follow me.”* He says.

Shying away from suffering is akin to refusing to eat. The end of that course of action is death. Our lives on this planet are inescapable temporal. We will either starve our spirits in a vain attempt to preserve what must fade; or we can rejoice in the hardships which nourish that lasting component of our being.

“ I have set before you life and death. Choose life.”
