**“Life’s A Female Dog” by Ariln Lampkin**

I was walking down the street (mind you) quietly with my hands in my pocket and eyes looking forward. And out of nowhere I got hit in the side of my head with a dirt rock that exploded on contact.

What poetry it was, cruel poetry. And what kind of pain I felt. My feelings were hurt more than the blow, and my head was already swelling not even a few minutes from getting rocked.

Man, I thought life sucked and it didn’t like me. *What the hell did I do?* I asked myself, disgruntled. A man can’t even mind his own business and get away with it! And who threw the rock in the first damn place?! No one was in sight to know, and there were no clues to find out, either.

So I have to accept this personal injury in pity. That’s life through, ain’t it? It throws something hard at you, hits you in the head with it, and then leaves you to be in lonely pain and feeling insulted because jack can be done about it.

Wow! That’s a female dog for you. She looks nice and tamed until she feels threatened by your very existence. Then she lashes out at you as if she just had newborn puppies and you came too close to them.

If that analogy is the case then you can’t be mad at the bitch. All you can really say is life’s a female dog.

Well I guess she wants some worship, because I don’t want to get hit like that again, so I’ll praise her anyways for her wonders and her catastrophes. Just please let me be.

I don’t mean no disrespect or ignorance, but I will be careful next time on how I ponder and approach her. And I promise not to not pay her the attention she deserves, and I’ll maybe see the next rock coming, at least.
