**Biggest Loser by Vicki Hicks**

I have battled with my weight for many years. After my second child, it was harder to lose the “baby fat”, then came number three and that was it. I had to put a stop to this. I began to drop  off the pounds due to stress, but once everything was back on track in my life, the weight caught up to me. In 2004, Easter Sunday, I was trying to warm up our horse for the children to ride and the surge of the pressure washer spooked her and she took off. When she reached her favorite spot in the fence she sat and spun 180 degrees throwing me off, when I landed and broke my right upper arm. With a botched surgery and many years of occupational therapy as well as four subsequent surgeries. I was a mess emotionally, spiritually, and physically. I was the heaviest. I have been  my entire life.  180 pounds.  I had to do something. I was miserable. A friend was a part of a program at the local YMCA called Boot Camp; she encouraged me to join her and see what it was all about. When I got around to joining they were beginning the biggest loser competition. I joined thinking it was going to be a few drops a week of exercising. I was so wrong. We learned how to read labels… Wow! Is all I can say. Have you ever read the label on a Nature valley granola bar. Let’s put it this way, you could eat one serving of a honeybun and get the same thing. Just because something sounds healthy does not mean it is. As I make my shopping list for the canteen. I am hesitant to put things on my list that have high fructose corn syrup. The silent inner tube around your midsection. I went on to lose 31 pounds and six pants size. I placed fourth for the season. It’s very hard to maintain a healthy weight here as we prefer comfort food as opposed to healthy food. Exercise  is essential. Try to minimize bloaty foods such as bananas, beans, whites, and oats. You do this for 21 days and you will see a difference in the spare tire we all carry around.
