**In Search of the Mystic Ones**

**By: Thomas Combs**

Here I stand,

A loaded gun in hand.

Glistening on every surface, refreshing morning dew,

Presenting this day anew.

I roam the plains,

In search of the elusive ones that remain.

I embrace the hunt with much delight,

As I wait out the day, and into the night.

I possess the power and the will,

Excited to produce the skill to complete the kill.

For I am destined for this great feat.

They hide in the shadows, shrouded in mystery.

It’s time is dwindling, drawing to an end,

Finally making his presence known, proving he’s not pretend.

Clack, Clack, round enters chamber, line up sights, gently squeeze,

The report of the shot is heard, then he drops to his knees.

Life is slowly draining, the fire extinguished,

Stand over this massive ten-point, Mmm, I can taste the tender brisket!
