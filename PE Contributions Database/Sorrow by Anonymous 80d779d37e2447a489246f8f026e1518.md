"Sorrow" by Anonymous

As the rain falls, I feel the loss of my dearly departed mother. The rain does as my heart does, cries knowing my sweet mother will never see the beauty of a summer day, the beauty of a field of flowers, of a mother’s day outing or gift, of another birthday or feel the love of her only daughter when we embrace. My heart feels great sorrow knowing I haven’t got my mother near. I stand here looking down, feeling the loneliness of the world without my mother. I stand here broken hearted, and even though I don’t cry physically, my heart is in distress and people can see my pain, yet none can feel the sorrow I feel for my loved one lost.
