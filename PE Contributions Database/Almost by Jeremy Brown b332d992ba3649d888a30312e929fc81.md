**Almost by Jeremy Brown**

I was almost accidentally murdered. This is the story of how it went down.

I was in West Palm Beach County Jail. I was seventeen. I was adjudicated or placed in an adult jail as a minor. I had fought an aggravated battery that had pinched my ass in a Drug Rehab Program. He tried me and so I put him in the hospital, and they put me in jail. So one night my neighbor and I were sleeping and my neighbor was in a gang called The Bloods. He has beef with a rival gang the Crips. One of The Crips came over to our dormitory and was supposed to give my roommate a 180 or cut with a razor on his cheek. Instead he thought I was my roommate and cut me underneath my right eyebrow. Once he realized he had the wrong dude, our dormitory sergeant came rushing in the room and slammed The Crip Hulk Hogan style face-first into the ground. Meanwhile I’m losing blood fast---it was a tiny slit, only got four stitches but I lost nearly a gallon of blood. And no I’m not embellishing the story; I was in and out of consciousness. Thank god for my roommate, he made some sort of staunch and we were right near medical within 10 minutes I was in the hospital. The Jail let me out eventually because they didn’t want to get sued for letting another person in another dormitory. So I almost was accidentally murdered. The crazy thing is after that happened to me I wasn’t scared because I knew a higher force was protecting my body. Not only that but if the medical team was a couple minutes late I would have lost too much blood. It’s so uncanny how it happened and everything was right there to help me in my time of most dire need. This play of life is most daunting indeed.
