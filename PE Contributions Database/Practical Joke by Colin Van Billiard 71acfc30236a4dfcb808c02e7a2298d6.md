**"Practical Joke"** **by Colin Van Billiard**

Practical jokes are funny

Long as they aren’t on you

Take your photos ha ha

What a laugh is

The planning hoping it works

Hoping he or she won’t check on

For just a laugh, cause a fight

Then what if they do it to you?

Practical jokes are they funny

Or do people just say that they got me

Ha Ha and usually you can’t see it

Enjoy your practical jokes
