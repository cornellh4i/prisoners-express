**"Practical Joke" by Frederick Lawrence**

I was born in Staten Island, New York but raised in Jackson, New Jersey. After four trips to the Texas Department of Corrections spending nearly half of my 58 years in some kind of prison, jail or institute and currently serving two 50 year sentences, I can easily say my childhood days were my best. Although I was raised in New Jersey, my parents’ roots were in the Deep South states of Texas.

All my aunts, uncles and cousins reside somewhere and everywhere in southeast Texas. My dad was chief engineer for Mobil Oil. He worked on the boats in the Bay of New York, but when it came time for his vacation, we would drive to Beaumont, Texas to see family. I quickly learned how different life in south Texas was from New Jersey. People talk differently, walk differently and dress differently. My older brother told me, “They can’t help it. They’re hillbillies.”

On one of these vacations, my mom was told that one of her brothers had been accidently shot in the foot. So we made the extra trip from Beaumont to Dibol, Texas. That’s when I discovered real hillbillies. The kids ran around barefoot, dirty and half naked. One kid had dried snot stuck on his nose. It must have been there for months. They were the poorest people I have ever met. This one kid held on to what appeared to be a biscuit. He didn’t eat it. Rather, he refused to let it out of his grasp as if it were the last biscuit those hillbilly kids would see for a while since they chased that kid with a biscuit through the woods to get it. However, one by one, I saw these kids giving up the pursuit due to total exhaustion or the craving of a drink of water from a horse trough in a barn. After nearly two hours, the dirtiest man I’ve ever seen walks in, and I even smelled him before I saw him. My first thought was “no wonder the South couldn’t win the war, they stunk too bad to hide.” His hair was long and malted together as if someone had poured syrup over his head 6 months ago. He had on once cowboy boot, and his other foot was wrapped in an torn up dirty sheet. I think he was drunk; he barely made it to the couch. Uncle “Shug” is all I’ll ever know, except that he was my mom's brother: a Matthews and a drunk. His first and only comment before passing out was. I need a haircut.” I looked at my brother and he was laughing and I knew what he was thinking. After the adults moved to another room and the other kids seemed to get their second wind, my brother asked me: “think we should give him that hair cut?” We both laughed. I snuck mom's car keys out of her purse and we dug in the trunk and came out with dad’s clippers. We shaved him bald, and no one even noticed us at work except the critters in my uncle's hair, jumping for their little lives as they’re home was being invaded. No sooner than we returned the clippers to trunk and the keys to mom’s purse did we heard someone yell, “Who shaved Shug?”

No answer.

But it did bring an audience. Again, “Who shaved Shug?” Still no answer. Finally, I pointed and said, “It was the kid with the biscuit.” Everybody looked at him, and I guess it wasn’t the first time he’d been in this situation because he broke and ran for the door without a word. I heard someone else say, “Get the kid with the biscuit!” Confusion became chaos, and chaos became more confusion.

They never caught that kid with the biscuit, and they never caught me and my brother either until dad tried to use his clippers a few days later back in Beaumont. By then, it had been determined that the deed was justifiable and ultimately brought the best results.

Several years later, my dad retired from the Mobil Oil, and we moved to Texas and built a home in the woods of a small town called Silsbee, Texas. One day when my aunt came to visit us after Uncle Shug’s whiskey drinking days caught up to him, I couldn’t help but ask, “Hey you ever find out who shaved Shug?” She told me, “Yea, and it wasn’t the kid with the biscuit.” We both laughed.
