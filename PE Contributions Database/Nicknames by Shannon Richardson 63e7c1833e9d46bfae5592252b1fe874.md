In prison, nicknames say a lot about a person. Unlike nicknames on the street that are usually given to you by someone else, people can create their own nickname. I just wish people would put more thought into the name they want to be called.

Your nickname says a lot about your state of mind. For example, I know women here who call themselves “Sexy,” “Juicy,” and “Luscious”. What do you think these women have on their minds? What do you think of when you hear the nicknames “Cujo,” “Razor,” and “Monster”?

As a I child, I was given the nickname “Wild Child.” Now, people like to call me “Red” because of my red hair (original, right?). Those are not names I gave myself.

In here, I am Shannon. That’s who I am, who I have always been, and who I will always be. I don’t need a nickname to add to or take away from that.

Hello, my name is Shannon, and you can call me Shannon.
