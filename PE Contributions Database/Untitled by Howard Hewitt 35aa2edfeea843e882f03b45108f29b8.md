Because I’m here and born on this day, I stretch my wings in the sky as I make my mark. You see me as I wisp on by. We fly parallel and mark our spot in the sky as we do every year during our migratory life. I’m on a journey across the blue skies. I see all of you in your strange contraptions, moving on the ground through the same paths I follow. I’m flying freely with my family as we mingle together as God intended us. I’m sure you wonder what’s going on because I watch you each year, but this time, you watch us in awe. What is it about our flight that makes you stop? I’ve watched your colorful machines crash into each other when we flock together, and watched people walk into buildings and each other. This is our life: it’s how we are raised from birth until death. God has put this in us, and we have this little magnet in us which lets us guide ourselves in the air. We have a built-in radar thanks to God. I can make it from the North to the South, stay warm in the winter, and feed. This is all part of my homing device and ability to stay alive. I am free. I am born to fly and stretch my wings in the sky.
