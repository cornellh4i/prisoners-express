**Arguments by Jevon Jackson**

Arguing makes us extremely emotional, irrational people. In the midst of a heated argument between two adults, there are accelerated heartbeats, rushed shallow breathing, increased voice levels, reflexive distorted viewpoints, a masking of internal vulnerabilities, mixtures of righteous indignations and victim-playing, and an overall primal drive to assert some measure of superiority in the subtle interplay of a tenuous power dynamic. It can get ugly. And depending on the situations and circumstances of the argument, it can escalate into a physical altercation or result in the indelible strain of a long-lasting relationship.

When you’re a convicted prisoner without a lawyer, fighting your civil case in federal court, you quickly learn that there is no room for emotional or irrational reactions when presenting your legal arguments to a judge.

What compelled me to file my very first lawsuit against prison officials, in the early 2000’s, was because prison mailroom staff began rejecting incoming print-outs of emails from my personal pen pal webpage. At the time, I had a single poem posted on Inmate.com, and people who visited the site and saw the page could either to me directly via snail mail or leave email messages and feedback, which the site would then print out and snail mail the messages to me.

Over the course of a year, I received the email print-outs without incident. And then one day, the prison mailroom staff suddenly began rejecting my, as well as other guys’, email printouts. “You can’t get these in anymore,” mailroom staff explained to me, “It’s a security risk.”

It baffled me as to how paper print-outs of email messages from regular folks from different parts of the world could be classified as a risk to security. Frustrated with all of the illogical and contradictory policies and regulations that I had to plod through everyday, I decided to challenge it in court. At the time, I had zero experience with civil litigation or constitutional law. But I had read a case, where prisoners in California had been successful in challenging a similar mailroom regulation. So I had a little bit of confidence, although I had no idea what I was doing.

I filed the lawsuit, and within a few months, my First Amendment constitutional claim was dismissed at the district court level. Unwavering in my confidence, I filed an appeal in the 7th Circuit’s federal court of appeals. I read everything I could that would help me on how to better prepare my case for the higher court.

One of the things I need, which stuck out to me, was that the best legal arguments evoke a basic sense of fairness, decency and harmony. The law, as intended, is designed to maintain a delicate balance of order. Because disorder leads to chaos. And chaos upsets the status quo and disrupts the stability of those in power. So the trick for me, in crafting my legal argument, was to show how prison staff were being unreasonable and illogical in balancing the exercise of their authority against my fundamental right to communicate with the outside world.

In representing the prison administrators, the state Attorney General’s office argued to the court that the prison mailroom was justified in rejecting the email print-outs because we, the prisoner, could defraud and deceive the public if we were allowed such means to establish pen pal connections with people who lived beyond these walls. My counter-argument was, first, the prison staff had failed to introduce any evidence that I or other prisoners in the facility were using the emails to defraud the public; and second, I pointed to the fact that we were still allowed to communicate via snail mail with people who visited the pen pal site. So it was unreasonable to reject print-outs of emails when snail mail pen pal correspondence was still permitted.

Ultimately, the 7th Circuit court agreed with me. They reversed the dismissal and remanded the case back down to the district court. A week later, the Department of Corrections’ head Security Chief issued a memo to all Wisconsin prison mailrooms instructing them to allow inmates to receive print-outs of email messages from personal web pages and pen pal sites. Through a clear, balanced, well-reasoned legal argument, I was able to protect one of my most basic rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and keep all lines of the communication open with the outside world.
