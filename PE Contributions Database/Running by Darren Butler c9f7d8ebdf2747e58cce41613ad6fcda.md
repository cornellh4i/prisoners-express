**Running by Darren Butler**

I wanted to send this little story about a time when I was probably about eleven years old and I was curious about lighters and matches and fire. It was a novelty I just could not ignore. I don’t remember anymore how I let the fire get away from me, setting the curtain on fire. Even then I already had a healthy respect for the destructive capabilities of fire and I had it put out quick. The result was about a 50 cent coin sized hole. But to hear my mom tell it I had nearly burned everything down to the waterline. I knew I couldn’t hide it. It stunk. By the end of the day I had very completely forgotten everything. Rather than telling me what I did, my mom pretty much just started swinging. But she had a certain lack of coordination, and it didn’t matter thigh, back, or ass there was little restraint for what always seemed like an eternity. Well I really did walk down the highway from our neighborhood to this little tiny lake called Lake Lilian in the heart of the next town over. My plan was to walk to my grandmother’s place. But when I got to the lake I decided to hang out for a while. There were these two kids younger than I was by a few years, a boy and a girl who were trying to fish off the pier. I knew they would never catch anything for all the turtles infesting the water. When the girl tangled her line I helped her, climbing down close to the water. Moved by my kindness, their parents struck up a conversation with me. I told them how I didn’t remember what I was being punished for. And somehow they convinced me to let them take me back home as they happened to live in my neighborhood. Oddly enough, it really was several years before it dawned on me what I had done.
