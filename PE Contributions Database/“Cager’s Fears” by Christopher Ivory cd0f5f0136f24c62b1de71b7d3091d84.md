**“Cager’s Fears” by Christopher Ivory**

Cave Cager had to face his fears in several ways. As a bat and bird catcher, he feared being bitten by a bat, and that happened. After Cager slipped and fell in a cave, small cage bats bit him and infected him with rabies, but Cager was also afraid of heights. So the fall itself gave him a heart attack and stroke. It was the rabies that actually kept Cager alive because the fall would have killed him and did kill him for about 2 minutes. As a rabies-infected zombie, Cave Cager feared society as a whole, but he knew he couldn’t just stay in the cave and eat bats forever, and so early one morning, Cager went to visit a few real estate agents to buy some farm land. Cager bought a farm house with lots of land near the woods and a swamp. Cager spent his days eating raw gators and raw, wild animals at night to feed his rabies.
