Mom-Maw & Pop-Paw by Curtis Colvin

My mother had me when she was just 15 years old. So she left me a lot with my grandmother (who I called Mom-maw) so she could get out and be a teenager.

I don’t remember my real grandfather, for he died before I was born. But my Grandmaw married again when I was around 3 years old. He was a good man. He worked for a local pipefitters union hall as a janitor. Him and my Mom-maw would bring me sometimes to work with them. It was a blast. Especially when my Pop-paw would let me use the floor buffer. Just picture this 5 year old little boy trying to wrestle with a floor buffer which was bigger than himself. It produced some laughs.

My Mom-maw was a cook/janitor for the Port Neches School District. She quit though when she got married to my Pop-paw. They moved to Deweyville, TX on some land which had some pecan and pear trees. I loved to go and stay with my grandparents. I would help Pop-paw mow and rake the yard, while Mom-maw would be in the house, cooking some great meals. I do miss them tremendously.

My Pop-paw was mowing one time in his slippers and a little stick went through them into one of his toes. Well, gangrene set in, and he died horribly. My Mom-maw just gave up after my mother died. Mom-maw quit taking her medicine and eating. I didn’t know she was like that until after she died. I had gotten married and was deep into my drug addiction then. So, Mom-maw, I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you in the end. I miss you and Pop-paw a lot. I hope to see you two again in that glorious place we call Heaven.
