**“Unbraid Our Hair With Understanding” by Robert Clayton**

****There are a people on Earth. And you have come to know them as Asians. But unfortunately, you still don’t see them. Even if they had left their homeland centuries ago and are now American citizens. That truth is hidden in a very simple question we ask them. Would you be so very kind as to stop reading this, and think about just what that might be?

The question every single member of the Asian community totally and completely dreads is *Where are you from?* And even though you may not have meant it to be disrespectful, it was. Oh, yeah? You can bet the farm on it. For even though it came in through their ears, they felt it within their hearts. I mean, look. Do they ask red peoples, black peoples, or even speckled gray peoples, that question?

So, the next time you meet an Asian person, try speaking to them in this manner. “Ma’am, I would like to ask you three questions. If you could be so kind as to answer them, I would be grateful.” Then ask: “Do you have a clock in your home that tells a time, other than where you live? Do you have any spices in your cupboard that are grown in another country? What language do you think in?” Then, speak of things relatable to pretty much anyone. Preferably, involving a context that’s within the confines of your current destination.

Asian peoples fight so very hard for their own families, you see. In fact, they only segregate themselves to be respectful to others. And, in all honesty, their belief that we, the mixed multitude within America, just can’t take any culture shocks, is true. Now, if you don’t believe that, just look within, and remember the last time you referred to them as “those people”.

We, those people, can change that. Very slowly, but surely. All it will take on our own part is a bit of acknowledgement. They do it. Every single day, by willingly losing money in their restaurant business, which is due to the fact they want you to feel them within your very own heart. I mean, good food does this, you know. It is something all peoples that exist share. Along with dance, song, love, and even sadness.

Beliefs have to get past their own foolishness first, you know. Others are not the problem: we are. And that statement is as equally true as ethnocentrism is terrible. You may feel this, by understanding that somebody can be forgiven by the person they harm. Then, in turn, that individual might look beyond it, his or herself. But if free will is to be held as true, I, as a man, cannot and will never forgive you for trying to rule me based upon how you believe I should live my own life. Because when this happens to me, and it will eventually to all, it makes your persona the purpose of my staying away, causing me to be segregated within.

Please! Understand. I myself have been held toward guilt for this atrocity, just as many have been and will be. Usually it is due to either one or two reasons that when linked together become the worst invention since the dictionary. When we mix our profession of faith with blinded traditional observances, we birth destruction. More importantly, a type based solely upon the foundations of false judgements. The only way to get out of this is by simple teaching, by means of showing. Something even an adult-child can do within their own comfort zone. Yes, all one must do is ask questions in a specifically respectful manner. Then sit back, and allow creation to keep on creating.
