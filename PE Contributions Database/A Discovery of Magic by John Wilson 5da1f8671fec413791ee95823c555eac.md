***A Discovery of Magic* by John Wilson**

My sister was at it again. First, she woke me up by whacking me with a stuffed tiger. When I went back to sleep, she let loose a thunderstorm. At least, that’s what I’d thought when my chest of drawers crashed over and she poured water on my head.

“Ok, I’m up, I’m up!”

“Mom, he’s up!” She screeched through my open door.

“Tell him I want his room clean before he comes down.” Mom’s voice sounded like it was right outside my door, though I knew she wasn’t.

“Mom says you have to clean up your room before you come down.” She solemnly held the tiger in her crossed arms. Then, with only a clatter and a crash of sound, she was gone.

I surveyed the mess she’d made of my room. Walking over to the chest of drawers, I tried to lift it back into place. How’d she even move it in the first place? I could barely lift it, and I knew she wasn’t that strongly telekinetic. Then a drop of water fell into my eyes, and I dropped the chest onto my toe. And where’d she get the water, anyway?

Once I cleaned up my personal disaster area, I went down to the kitchen. My sister was eating cereal, her bowl rattling furiously as she hunted out the marshmallow bits. Dad was eating and reading a newspaper. As Mom asked me what I wanted for breakfast, a page turned and Dad’s fork put another bite of egg and toast in his mouth, both seemingly of their own volition.

“Waffles?” Before I sat down, a plate was in front of me with just the right number of waffles and the perfect amount of syrup and butter. It made me smile as I picked up my own fork.

Food was Mom’s special talent, but she could manifest almost anything. Dad was an ectoplasmist, able to imbue inanimate objects with a life of their own though he had to keep his attention on them. My sister was a poltergeist, so everything she does includes noise and some amount of telekinesis. And I was...just me. No special abilities, though I knew my parents hadn't given up hope that one would develop. I was way past the age when I should have had powers, and that put me in a distinct minority.

It was raining when I headed off to school where the principal was kind enough to have a class entirely for people with no powers. It meant that I had friends who didn’t rub that in. We played sports or built robots or ran science experiments while the rest of the school learned to use and control their abilities. Of course, my class got smaller every year as late-bloomers developed and were put in a control class.

I’m used to not having any kind of power. The worst part is the awkward silence when somebody I’ve just met asks, “and what do you do?” It’s like going to shake with someone only to realize they’re missing a hand.

I was almost at school when I saw the new girl. She had on a long raincoat and a black umbrella, so her face stood out. She was beautiful. We locked eyes for a moment before she turned, and we were pulled into the school by the rush of people responding to the first bell. I found myself beside her as she paused a moment to close the umbrella.

“Hi.”	She smiled a bit uncertainly. “Hi. Umm, I’m Andraste.”

“I’m Norman. Can I help you find your class?”

“Uh, yeah, thanks. I’m looking for...Ms. Shelbink’s?”

She was a mundane, and she was in my class. I had to play this cool, when I really wanted to shout and turn cartwheels. “You’re in the right company. That’s my class, too. It’s this way.”

We cautiously made friends with each other over the next few weeks. Then one day, I saw her in the hallway surrounded by a group of boys who were among the worst bullies in the school. Tears streaked her pretty face as they used their powers to pull the books from her hands and twisted her hair into knots.

Before I even thought about it, I gripped the football I was bringing in from the sports class and threw it as hard as I could. I’ve been playing football since middle school, and I’ve got a deadly arm. The ball blasted the back of Tony’s shoulder, jolting him enough that he lost focus on his powers. Andraste’s books crashed to the floor from where he’d been making them dance and tumble through the air. He turned to look at me, dumbfounded.

“Pick on somebody that’ll actually bloody your nose for you, douchebag.” I pulled another football out of the sports bag, and got ready.

The first football floated up to shoulder height and began to spin. “What did you think you were going to do? A noner against me?”

Noner. Slang for “non-powered.” At the slur, people began edging to each end of the hallway. Looking at the spin of the football, I began to regret giving him a weapon. He could rocket that thing with an ectoplasmic burst far faster than I could use my own to break his concentration. I was outgunned.

I threw anyway, hoping to dodge, but I didn’t move fast enough. His football hit me in the ribs and knocked all the wind out of me. A second later, mine hit Tony square in the nose, bloodying it immediately. As I lay half propped up on the lockers, I heard the click of cameras that the manifesters had been calling to hand. I couldn’t breathe and everything was muffled, almost silent except for that single noise. Tony scurried off to the bathroom with his flunkies following like a cloud of gnats on a stink.

The bell rang just as I wheezed in enough air to start breathing again. Andraste hurried to my side, hands over her mouth, and knelt. In seconds we were alone in the hallway. I raised my hand and wiped away the wet tracks left by the tears.

“Oh, you magnificent fool,” she whispered, then leaned in to kiss me. I lost my breath again.

The trouble started a few weeks later. I woke up for school, but the house was quiet. It felt ominous. With my sister’s powers, the house is never quiet.

I went downstairs and saw her sitting at the table, hugging her tiger and crying. I could hear Mom and Dad talking quietly in their room, and so I picked her up. As soon as I did, all the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as if a cold breeze had went down my shirt. I had the distinct feeling that I’d been tasted, as if by an animal nuzzling up to see if I was good to eat. It was eerie, but it went away and I returned to the task of comforting my sister.

After talking to Mom and Dad, I found out she’d lost her powers. At school, I discovered she wasn’t the only one.

Once I came back home, the house was no longer silent. My sister was gleefully making up for lost time, but it was my Dad’s powers that were on the fritz.

This went on, with different people being affected every day, but I noticed that more people lost their powers. At first it was about twenty. Now it was almost half the school.

We discussed it in Ms. Shelbink’s. A few were willing to let it go on, till they all lost their powers for good.

Andraste stood up when she heard that. “Stop it. You all know that isn’t right. To demand, or to allow, something to be taken away from others just because you don’t have it is wrong.”

One of the malcontents asked her, “Would you say the same about Tony and his crew?”

“Even them. Just because a few misuse their powers doesn’t mean they should all lose them. Think of all the good those with powers can do. There are healers who can fix things that were incurable in the past. Manifestors who produce our food. Ectoplasmists who keep our energy stations up and running. We all benefit. Those who misuse their powers should be taught better, not be stripped of those powers.”	The class discussion kind of stalled when someone asked, “But what can we do to help them recover the powers?” A few people reported being sniffed or tasted like I’d been, usually when next to somebody who’d lost their powers.

The next day I came to school in a funk because my sister was going through another powerless period. The amount of time between being affected and regained their powers was generally increasing. It seemed that the first time they lost their powers was the shortest.

Andraste stalked up to my locker, her place in a book marked by a finger. “I figured it out.”

I looked at the page she pointed out, then looked at the cover. “This is a book on mythology,” a quick flip to the copyright, “that’s over a hundred years old.”

“But look. It fits the symptoms exactly. Draugr are insatiably hungry spirits that target magicians, who lose all of their powers while being fed upon.”

“Ok, but how could we prove that this is what’s happening? I mean, people have only had powers for about sixty years. Maybe they’re just losing them as suddenly as people once gained them.”

“People gained powers when the dragons came back. As long as they’re all here, people will still have powers.”	“But this could be a disease, or…”

“I know how it can be proven. The history museum has some old stuff, like glasses people used to see spirits. We can get Ms. Shelbink to get them loaned to the school for an educational display, then see if we can spot anything.”

I shook my head. “You’ve been really thinking about this. If it is a Draugr, how do we stop it?”

“Them. It’s a lot of them. My theory is that they breed when they’ve fed off enough energy. And it says iron, leavened by ecto...How are we going to get that?”	“I know. Iron is anathema to ectoplasm, but I think I’ve got this figured out.” I remembered a demonstration a few years ago, where a group of manifestors and ectoplasmists created a pool of raw ectoplasm, and let us all play with it.

It took almost a week to get two pairs of the special glasses from the museum. As a bonus, they also included a chemistry set specifically designed to experiment with ectoplasm. It was perfect for what I had in mind. Meanwhile, Andraste cajoled the whole class to pull iron nails out of old buildings. With the newly acquired glasses, and a team to bottle us some raw ectoplasm, we got our first look at a Draugr and had an arsenal ready for it.

It looked like a bloated corpse riding on the girl’s back, its lips fastened on her neck. We put my plan into action. I unstoppered a beaker of ectoplasm. Andraste and I watched its malevolent eyes fix on the beaker, then it let go of the girl and floated over. As soon as the Draugr began slurping it up, Andraste dropped a nail through the spirit and into the beaker. The ectoplasm began to boil and evaporate immediately. We watched as the creature from a bad horror movie boiled and dissipated along with it. The nail crumbled into a small pile of rust.

We shared the glasses with the rest of the class, so everyone knew what a Draugr looked like, but we also conducted naked-eye experiments so that we’d all know when a beaker had attracted one of the spirits and when to drop the nail. It took less than a week to clear the town of the infestation. People recovered their powers as soon as their bodies built up enough of an ectoplasmic charge. My sister’s poltergeisting stopped as her power matured into an ectoplasmist.

The school threw a party for our class. Manifestors catered and provided a fireworks display. Ectoplasmists entertained us with self-playing instruments, juggling, and even fireworks dance in the air. The highlight was when Tony came up to Andraste and me, shuffling his feet for a moment then visibly bucking up.

“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been picking on you. I can’t thank you enough for helping, even after I was such a douchebag.”

Later that night, Andraste and I were alone, sitting on her front porch.

“What do you think it would be like? To live somewhere that nobody has powers?”

She shook her head, then showed me that old mythology book. “But I think we can find out. It talks of a place called Waystation.” She read me the description. “It is said to be the midpoint between all of the worlds, the place where you can travel from one world to the next.” Turning her soft eyes back to mine, she said, “Graduation’s in a few weeks. Come with me, and we’ll find Waystation together. We’ll go to a world where no one has powers.”

I took that old book, and I threw it over my shoulder as I leaned in to kiss her. This time I took her breath away.
