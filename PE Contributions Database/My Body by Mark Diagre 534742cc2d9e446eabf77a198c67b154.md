**My Body by Mark Diagre**

Despite being betrayed by it over and over and over again throughout my life, I am both amazed and in love with my body. I am tall 6’ 5”, and relatively thin, 220lbs and I have been so my entire life. There was a time in puberty when I was some 6’ 2” and weighed 100lbs. I am told that I looked like a bag of bones in a wetsuit. I worked very hard to gain weight and did so, gaining 50lbs in a little less than a year, and I was still skinny!

As a child and teenager, my body further betrayed me by responding to the sexual molestation that I was being subjected to. No matter how much my brain told me “this is wrong,” my body craved the touch and release that ensued. The close contact and the overt ‘physical-ness’ of the close-ness over those seven plus years. I was confused, to say the least.

More recently, I have been dealing with my body betraying me in new and interesting ways. Pain from old injuries that is resurfacing, arthritis, pinched nerves and general achiness. I have also had to deal with a bout of cancer. Caught early and removed, but scary still.

At 53, I am just now becoming comfortable with what my body looks like. I hated the fact that I have had long and thin arms and legs most of my life. It was only in the last five to ten years that I have been able to look in the mirror and like the person that I see, some of that is due to the work that I’ve done about my past. And some is due to accepting that I will never be 5’ 10” and muscular.

There is a history to be read in and on my body. I have many, many scars and healed breaks that show my life in a tapestry of forgotten pain. I also have two tattoos. One a mistake, gotten in my 20’s and regretted almost ever since. The other I’ve had for most of the last ten years, a Buddha on the back of my lower right leg. That one I do not (and most likely will never) regret. Buddha is a daily reminder of that untouchable, piece of perfection that I and everyone else on the planet has, the part of us that is “perfect”, no matter what.
