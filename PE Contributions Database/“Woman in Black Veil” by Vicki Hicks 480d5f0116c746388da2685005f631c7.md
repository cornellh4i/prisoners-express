**“Woman in Black Veil” by Vicki Hicks**

People say you should celebrate at a funeral and cry at birth, this is because one is leaving the corrupt world and one is entering it. Well, my funeral came in the form of divorce papers on August 3, 2019, after 27 years of marriage. That is to say that one chapter died as a new one was born. The awful thing about all of this is that after 27 years together our life has been reduced to paper. How sad to think about that. Some days I feel like my heart is being ripped out, others, I am just fine. I am stronger because of all I have and all I am going through. The best part of the story is that not only is he divorcing me and trying to take everything away from me, he is living with my biological sister. She sounds like me so the only thing I can think of is that he missed me and found my voice in her. The dagger to heart came when my sister visited me and acted like everything was just fine. The nail in the coffin was when he tried to convince our friends that I was okay with what was going on because I know she will hand him back when I get out. So my funeral procession continues; there truly is no celebrating or crying. I am just numb most of the time. Now I have to learn to be single and care-free when I exit this place. That will be the new chapter!
