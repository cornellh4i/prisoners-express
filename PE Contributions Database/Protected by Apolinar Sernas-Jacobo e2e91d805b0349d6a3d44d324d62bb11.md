**Protected By Apolinar Sernas-Jacobo**

Earlier this month I went to chow at dinner time. They were serving us chicken that day. I was enjoying my meal when someone started punching me and hitting me. I covered my face and sat still. After a good moment the guy stopped. I uncovered my face and looked around for the officers. “Did they see what just happened?” I asked myself. I started laughing. The other guys sitting at the same table as I was, were stunted. “Protected” I say to myself very thoughtful. In here the only protection you get is the one and only protection you give yourself. Later on, I found out the guy who assaulted me hears voices. It’s part of his mental illness. He is well known for assaulting people out of the blue. I learned that as long as I’m with me I will be protected. So, now everywhere I go I feel very safe. Lol.

P.S. Even though the guy got some issues I’m still confused. Why me? He should have picked someone else. I’m just saying.
