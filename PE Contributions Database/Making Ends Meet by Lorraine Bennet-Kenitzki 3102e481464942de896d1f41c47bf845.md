**Making Ends Meet by Lorraine Bennet-Kenitzki**

The yarn almost made it to the row, then the skein seemed to stretch no more. I opened the next skein and crocheted some more, tightening my grip as I prepared to make it work.

The pattern is pretty, the colors rich in sequence: 5, 10, 2, 10, 5, and so on.

We’ll make it work (we, who? It’s just me, the yarn, and the hook).

It’s beautiful. It’ll look great on your bed, couch, or chair.

Thank you for the work, I hope this is okay, better than okay. I changed the hook size by just 0.5mm. One letter up, not down.

I’ll make these rows match. Make my ends meet.

The next one will be beautiful too.
