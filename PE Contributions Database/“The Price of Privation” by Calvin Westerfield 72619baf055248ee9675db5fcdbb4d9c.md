**“The Price of Privation” by Calvin Westerfield**

President-elect Donald won the election by a substantial margin a couple weeks ago. America now has a man who holds the opinions of a modern day George Lincoln Rockwell that has made clear his supremacist agenda to “Make America Great Again.” Trump will be sworn in come January 2017 and will hold the highest office in the United States of America, but many American citizens do not feel safe under his leadership. Can such a result be viewed as a win for Mr. Trump or the millions of rural middle to lower class supporters who voted him into office? Niccolo Machiavelli said, “Men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules; wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse.”	Winning does not always equal victory. Thousands of people have had their lives ruined because luck made them winners of the lottery. Simple, ordinary people turned millionaires literally overnight. You have the stories on T.V. of those winners who settle for the lump sums and seemingly overnight, they become famous. Suddenly everyone shows up at their door, and calls start to come in from relatives and old friends they haven’t heard from in years. They move to a huge mansion they don’t need and end up blowing most of the money on insignificant things to fill this new home. A few years later, they are in debt, have lost all their family and real friends, and many end up committing suicide. Winning is actually losing in such instances.

A truly triumphant person is one who has discovered the peace of knowing who they are inside, getting to cultivate that energy, and using it to add to this world freely. “The virtue of all achievements is the knowledge of self, those who know this victory shall never know defeat.”
