**“Gratitude: the Moisturizer of Life” by Catherine LaFleur**

I am grateful to dormitory workers who clean the bathrooms and the dorm areas every day. I am grateful that I don’t have to worry about passing the white glove inspection every two weeks because a worker will touch up all the missed areas.

I am especially grateful to the bed-makers. Although I do make my bed every morning at 4:15am, with hospital corners and correctly folded sheet cuff, I know that if something isn’t right a worker will come check everything out.

Today is the last inspection month of March. At 4:30 this morning one of these magical elves come into my room to ask if she could make my bed while I was out to early breakfast.

“Sure,” I told her. When I returned to my cell, my patched blanket was spread patches side down. That’s how I knew she had remade my bed.

About thirty minutes later, elf number two came by my cell. “Catherine, do you mind if I remake your bed? The cuff is too large and the corners aren’t right.”

I was on my way to pick up my daily dose of allergy medicine. I told her “sure” and left. When I returned to my cell, I noted elf number two had flipped the blanket again and the patches were once again visible on the top. That’s how I knew she had remade the bed.

At 6:45am elf number three knocked on my door. “Hi Catherine, I’m making all the beds on the top tier. Do you mind if I remake your bed, it’s not tight enough.”

I paused for just a moment. “Sure, have at it, I’m going to make a cup of tea.” When I returned, my patched blanket was spread patches side down. That’s how I knew she had remade my bed.

Moments later, a casual observer came to my cell to tell me that three people had come in while I was out of the dorm. I shrugged my shoulders in a “what’s-a-girl-to-do” manner then thanked her and told her the three elves had my permission.

After count at 7:45am, elf number four showed up at my cell and said, “Hey LaFleur, do you mind if I remake your bed when you leave the dorm for work call?”

All I could say was “No, no, I don’t mind at all.”

Now I did not tell any of the elves about each other. I’m pretty sure that they were criticizing my bed-making skills, unaware that they were in fact correcting each other’s work. Still, I’m grateful that I cannot be held responsible for this bed. When I returned to the dorm in the afternoon, I discovered that my laundry bag was not in compliance. Elves! What can you do?
