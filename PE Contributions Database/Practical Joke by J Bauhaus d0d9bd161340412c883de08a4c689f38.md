**"Practical Joke" by J. Bauhaus**

Right after the 1972 Riot in McAlester, where Oklahoma’s shittiest slow-death and daily harassment crime factory was burned down, they assigned highway patrol cops to keep the guards from exacting too much revenge too soon. Two years later, they threw me in there. They stole everybody’s television, radio, and fan, then made it almost impossible to get a book or a magazine that wasn’t about God. We were bored to death and locked into tiny 35 square foot cages with another criminal for more than 23 hours per day. I got lucky enough to be one of three cooks who worked 18 hours per day along with 89 other mess hall workers serving 2200 prisoners.

By Thanksgiving, three years after the riot, they were letting the captives walk to chow to eat. For us, they tore out an 8-man table that used to be bolted to the floor. They dragged it into the kitchen for us to eat on but never bolted down again. Sitting on it was a tricky balancing act.

We spent almost two days baking real turkeys. They had bones in them, if you can remember that. I was so tired by the time that the line was serving that I climbed up the ladder to the top of a store room and fell asleep. An hour later, I was startled awake by a sound across the cement floor, then slammed back down after throwing four highway patrol cops and their turkey dinners to the floor. Big Ed and a lot of us there thought that this was a pretty good practical joke. (Ed had been temporarily framed with a death sentence after a cop was killed during an escape from the chicken barn.) I thought it was funny, but even as much as everyone thinks I hate cops (I’ve been framed for 42 years for far), I couldn’t “accidently” throw them and their chow down on the floor. Even so, this still qualifies as a practical joke…
