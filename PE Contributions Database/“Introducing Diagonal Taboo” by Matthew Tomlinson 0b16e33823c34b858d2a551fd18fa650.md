**“Introducing Diagonal Taboo” by Matthew Tomlinson**

In my 56 years of living (as of October 7, 2016), I ain’t never liked a mountain. Ain’t no reason for me to start liking them now, all of a sudden! Mountain goats can keep my share of all 54 of those 14,000 feet peaks in Colorado. The view from that fourteener that Prisoner Express printed is an appealing alpine view up Winter Hawk valley on an attractive August afternoon. I ain’t never liked a mountain, and flat coastal plains have always been my turf and always will be.

Look directly ahead. You see the snow-covered Sunlight Peak?* Look below left. You see the trees? We need two hours to make it down that tree line, off of this bald slope. Look above left. You see that storm cloud arranging themselves for the traditional afternoon thunderstorm? We’ve got half an hour before the freezing rain begins. Look at Sunlight Peak again. You see that cloud shadow in the foreground? Once the shadow covers the snowcap, in probably fifteen minutes, then we’re within range of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. Recognize it when you see it. You’re a lightning rod. Give your heart and soul to God because your ass belongs to that cloud.

Look, this is my lie, so let me tell it, alright? You tell your lie your way, another day. Okay? Look at the bottom corner of the picture Gary Fine gave us. Read where it says, “Something or other shots.” It says, “It’s time for a couple of silver bag shots!” For those not in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, commissary sells a silver bag of 95-cent coffee that makes about 3 gallons. So do like the photo says: make a shot of coffee. Then look below that word “shots” to see that rock. It’s shaped like a prison brogan boot. Shoe Rock is a landmark with a Rabbit Trail. It’s 24 inches wide, and even your prison bunk was wider. We’re going to walk that Rabbit Trail to get off this bald slope. Don’t spill your coffee.

Look, I don’t run your life. Once we pass Shoe Rock, then the Rabbit Trail ledge drops sharply. Do not pick up your feet: set one foot firmly, then slide the other down. We’ll take 10 minutes to get 10 feet down the ledge. But do it my way, and we’ll make it. You want to do your way? That’s on you.

You can’t do it your way, you gotta turn diagonal! Two more steps, diagonal! Good, we got into Diagonal Taboo before the storm. We beat the system, and you didn’t slop too much coffee outta your cup, huh? You want to do things your way? That’s on you. Take what goes with that, though. You understand? You keep on buckin’, and you can’t get into Diagonal Taboo. The lightning bolts will come, and the Winter Hawk gets you. That’s what goes with being a hardhead.

Diagonal Taboo is the same size as my prison cell. Maybe yours is smaller, but we’ve got the Michael-type unit. Diagonal Taboo is named such because the door is a parody of the European road sign with the red circle and three diagonal slashes, meaning “entry forbidden.” Diagonal Taboo is...I don’t know...a dimensional transfer point. Yeah? You don’t believe in other dimensions, huh? Me neither. I’m in my cell on Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit in Amarillo. You’re in your cell, whichever prison you’re in. But here we are. We are both looking at this PE photo theme, somewhere neither of us have been. Now here you are, in my cell with me, although you aren’t. You came past Shoe Rock with me, though you didn’t. Your hard headed self struggled to get through the slash of Diagonal Taboo, though you didn’t realize it. You needn’t believe in other dimensions: it is what it is, believe it or not. Diagonal Taboo is a dimension transfer point, and PE brought you out of your cell, through the alpine valley photo, and into my cell. That’s my best explanation.

* Note: One of the Fourteeners located in Colorado is Sunshine Peak, not Sunlight Peak.
