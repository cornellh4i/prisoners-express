**Untitled By Cesar Hernandez**

Wise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves. If life does something that causes a disturbance inside of you, instead of pulling away, let it pass through you like the wind. After all, things happen everyday that cause inner disturbance. At any moment, you can feel frustration, anger, fear, jealousy, insecurity, or embarrassment. If you watch, you will see that the heart is trying to push it all away. If you want to be free you have to learn to stop fighting these human feelings.

When you feel pain simply view it as energy. Just start seeing the eye of your consciousness. Then relax. Do the opposite of contracting and closing. Relax and Release. Relax your heart until you are actually face to face with the exact place where it hurts. Stay open and receptive so you can be present right where the tension is. You must be willing to be present right at the place of the tightness and pain, and then relax and go even deeper. This is very deep growth and transformation. But you will not want to do this. You will feel tremendous resistance to doing this, and that’s what makes it so powerful. As you relax and feel the resistance, the heart will want to pull away, to close, to protect, and to defend itself. Keep relaxing. Let go and give room for the pain to pass through you. It’s just energy. Just see it as energy and let it go.

If you close around the pain and stop it from passing through, it will stay in you. If you don’t want the pain, why do you close around it and keep it? Do you actually think that if you resist it will go away? It’s not true. If you release and let the energy pass through, then it will go away. If you relax when the pain comes up inside your heart, and actually dare to face it it will pass. Every single time you relax and release, a piece of the pain leaves forever. Yet every time you resist and close, you are building up the pain inside. It’s like damming up a stream. You are then forced to use the psyche to create a layer of distance between you, who experience the pain, and the pain itself. That is what all the noise is inside your mind—ann attempt to avoid the stored pain.

If you want to be free, you must first accept that there is pain inside your heart. You have stored it there. You’ve done everything you can think of to keep it there, deep inside, so you never have to feel it. There is also tremendous joy, beauty, love, and peace within you. They are on the other side of the pain. On the other side of the pain is ecstasy. On the other side is freedom. Your true greatness hides on the other side of that layer of pain. You must be willing to accept pain in order to pass through to the other side. Just accept that it is in there and that you are going to feel it.Accept that if you relax, it will have its moment before your awareness and then it will pass. It always does.

Sometimes you will notice that it feels hot inside as pain passes. As you relax into the energy of the pain, you may feel tremendous heat in your heart. That is the pain being purified from your heart. Learn to enjoy that burning. It does not seem enjoyable, but you will learn to enjoy it because it is freeing you. Pain is the price of freedom. The moment you are not afraid of the pain, you’ll be able to face all of life’s situations without fear.
