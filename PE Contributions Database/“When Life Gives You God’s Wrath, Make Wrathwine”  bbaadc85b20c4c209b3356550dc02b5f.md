**“When Life Gives You God’s Wrath, Make Wrathwine” by Delvin Diles**

A ghetto queen, skin the lightest brown in a cheetah spot, watched a psychopath laugh about murder then asked two questions.

1. “You think taking a life is funny?”
2. “Have you ever thought about the Wrath of God?”

The silence that ensued in that dark living room 20 years ago still resonates.

In the moments of everyday prison life, there always comes a tendency amongst inmates to complain. Sometimes for legitimate reasons, sometimes frivolous. Hell, I’ve been guily of it. “Come on, C.O., that ain’t a full scoop!” I unsuccessfully tried to pout out recently in the chow line.

But oftentimes, I make a point to remind myself: This is a cup I poured up -- a bitter, burning, timeless spirit of crime and punishment, cause and affect, choices and consequences. I won’t sit and complain. I sip and continue. Not the most ideal drink, but healthier than the lethal injection taken in by the above mentioned psychopath.
