**“Problem Solved” by Phillip L. Rath**

Long ago and far away, through warps in time and space, there existed a land of peace and tranquility. A land where violence and strife were not found in any dictionary, and encyclopedias made no mention of war, pestilence or imperialism. This was a land of plants and animals of all kinds but nary a trace of a single human being. In short, it was Utopia!

Our story begins with Horatio L. Duck, a middle aged, working class stiff and father of 16. He met his responsibilities each morning with a joyful, “quack!”, wag of his tail feathers and flap of his wings, as he waddled off to Loving Lake to fetch fresh krill and watercress for his family. Little did Horatio suspect that today would yield unimaginable changes in his life.

On the other side of the lake lived a stately old gentleman by the name of Poindexter D, Fox, a bachelor and recluse who basked in the tranquility and routine of his life. he had no inkling that the languid pace of his life was soon to come to a crossroad of such magnitude it would baffle the mind!

Lilly B. Lark was busy gathering reeds to weave into new and unique patterns in constructing new basks, water carriers and other useful items used in the daily lives of every household. She had been dreaming of a new grandiose pattern for a basket large enough to carry the garden harvest of the day to the stables for the horses. She just knew it was going to be glorious and she was anxious to get started on it.

The local blacksmith, Ulysses O. Black Beat, had stoked his morning fire and was anticipating attaching the round discs to a tube frame to see what it would look like. If nothing, the symmetry would be awe-inspiring and certain to cause a stir in the art world of metal sculpture. Anticipatory energy fueled his anxiety to get started.

Horatio swam across the surface of the lake in pursuit of sustenance while Poindexter basked in the warm morning sun and breathed in the aromatic glory of the wildflowers growing in his cabin. Lilly twisted, turned, poked, and prodded her pliant reeds into her inspired basket design and Ulysses pumped his bellows, stirred the red-hot coals and tested the trueness of his four round discs as he contemplated the various methods to attach them to the frame. Each was focused on their own trivialities of his life and spent no effort considering what lay ahead for each of them.

Paddling languidly around the lake, Horatio was unaware of an alien, a newcomer to Loving Lake, swimming purposefully at the bottom, but his eyes focused on the perceived meal swimming on the surface. Finley C. Sturgeon was hungry and his natural reflexes to feed had kicked in and Finley was reduced to a feeding machine anxious to be filled.

With a flick of his powerful rail, Finley launched himself off the bottom, lunging upward, his razor-sharp tooth-filled jaws agape, aimed directly at the paddling feet of Horatio, hoping to feed on succulent duck!

SNAP! His jaw closed powerfully on Horatio’s feet but Finley had put too much effort into his attempt, and he bit clear through both feet, leaving poor Horatio with no means to walk, waddle, or paddle. In pain, but striving to survive, Horatio frantically flapped his wings, propelling him towards the bank of Loving Lake and safety!

“Quack! Quack!” warned Horatio to the others on the lake. “Be aware! Predator in the Lake! Seek safety, NOW!

Poindexter, hearing disturbance, looked around himself, searching for any danger in his immediate vicinity. Seeing no threat, he expanded his focus to include the lake where the disturbance seemed to originate. There on the lake, he spotted ducks and geese frantically flapping their wings in an effort to gain lift off the lake and into relative safety. But wait, not all of them were succeeding. Poindexter noticed Horatio frantically flapping his wings, unable to fly but gradually progressing toward the shallows.

Wanting to offer his assistance if needed, Poindexter rushed to the bank where it seemed Horatio would arrive if he continued his struggles. “Horatio, what’s the matter? Do you need help? What’s wrong?” cried out a bewildered Poindexter. Thank you, Poindexter, A giant fish bit off both my legs and I am unable to walk, waddle, or paddle. I can’t swim or even fly with no feet. I’ve gone as far as I can, and I need your help to get out of the water. Please help me!”

“I can’t swim Horatio, but if I back up to the water’s edge and extend my tail perhaps you can grip it in your bill, and I can pull you out of the water.”

This was quickly accomplished and once on dry land Horatio collapsed in exhaustion, gasping out, “oh Poindexter, thank you for rescuing me, but what’s to be done? I can’t provide for my family like this! What should I do?”

“I’ll head to town and see if I can find others to help you and maybe come up with some ideas. Try to relax and I’ll be back before you know it,” Poindexter told Horatio.

Rushing into town, Poindexter passed by the foundry and noticed Ulysses admiring a metal sculpture. “Ulysses, Horatio had both legs bitten off on the lake this morning and can now not walk, waddle, or paddle. Do you have any ideas to help him?”

I’ve been focused on my sculpture all morning and I just finished it”, replied Ulysses, “what do you think?”

It is certainly unique, but I don’t have time to stop and fully appreciate it right now. I have to find help for Horatio, and Poindexter was off!

House to house, Poindexter stopped, inquiring as to any ideas for his friends and neighbors that would solve Horatio’s dilemma.

Kristine Cow, ever mindful of her environment and willing to be of assistance, called to Poindexter, “Go see Lilly. Her head is always full of ideas and no one is as creative as she is. If anyone can help, it will be Lilly!”

With a polite, “thank you,” Poindexter was off in search of Lilly, which proved easy enough as her lilting song wafted on the breeze and led Poindexter directly to where Lilly was working.

“Lilly, I need your help. Horatio lost both of his legs this morning and is unable to walk, waddle or paddle. He can’t provide for his family in this condition and he needs our help! Do you have any ideas?”

“I am sorry”, said Lilly, I’ve been totally involved in creating this new basket all morning. It turned out beautifully, don’t you agree?”

“It is really creative and well-built, but I’m in a rush and must find a solution to the problem of mobilizing Horatio, so I really must run” and away he sped, off to find someone able to render assistance to Horatio.

Clyde Horse, Stacey Pig, Forrest Squirrel and Roofs L. Canine all were consulted, sympathized but were clueless as to how they could be of any aid to their friend Horatio.

Dejected, Poindexter returned to the bank of Loving Lake to break the bad news to Horatio. Maybe together, they’d find a solution to the problem, to his surprise, Lilly, Ulysses and Kristine were already with Horatio and seemed to be brainstorming a solution.

Suddenly, Lilly perked up, her wings excitedly and proclaimed, “I’ve got it! Today, I created a large unique basket that I believe Horatio will fit in, then someone can carry him about. In the basket, he won’t need his legs.”

“Great idea, Lilly, go get it immediately,” chimed in Kristine.

“It is far too big for me to carry,” chirped Lilly, when Ulysses grunted, “I’ll carry it for you! I’m big and strong so a basket will not be heavy for me”, and off they went to retrieve Lilly’s basket. When Ulysses laid eyes on the basket, he was struck by the size and shape of the thing. “You know Lilly, I do believe your basket is the perfect size to fit into a sculpture I finished just this morning. I’ll run over to my shop and get it. I think I have an idea!”, and off he ran to retrieve his amazing sculpture.

Ulysses returned with his sculpture tucked firmly under one arm, then gently set it alongside Lilly's basket, visually measuring both to ascertain if a proper fit were possible. Carefully lifting the basket, Ulysses set it firmly in place on top of his sculpture, realizing they seemed made to be together.

“they certainly look as if they were made together, but won’t it be too heavy to carry Horatio in?”, Lilly fretted.

“only one way to tell,” grunted Ulysses. “I’ll carry this down to the lake and we’ll try it out.”

Arriving together at the lake, Lilly & Ulysses explained their idea to the others, who remained, skeptical, but willing to try anything that might benefit their friend.

Ulysses set the contraption down, lifted Horatio gently into the basket and stood back to evaluate their results.

“it fits like a glove,” said Horatio, “and it is a lovely piece of art, but how will I move about?”

“I can carry you,” ventured Ulysses, “just tell me where you need to go.”

You have your shop to run and cannot be at my beck and call all day. Thank you, but we need another idea.

“I’m retired and free all day, “chimed in Poindexter, wanting to be helpful, “but I’m too small to lift you alone, never mind all this basketry and sculpture. I’m just so frustrated! There has to be a reasonable solution somewhere.” And with that, Poindexter gave up and just leaned all his weight against the sculpture.

“Look what’s happening,” yelled Kristine, that thing moved easily on those four discs when Poindexter leaned on it! Try pushing it Poindexter, I believe you’ve solved our problem,

Tentatively, Poindexter placed his forepaws on the sculpture, pushed gently, and they were off!

“problem solved,” declared Kristine. “Poindexter has free time to push Horatio around so he can provide for his family. We put aside our differences, exploited our talents, realized a problem and worked together to achieve a mutually beneficial solution. That’s what makes us a community!”.
