These days everyone is trying to "Fit In". With the crowd or with what seems to be the most appealing to one's own belief. From what I see with my two witnesses (my eyes) is all I will speak on. Most people fear to be themselves, because they think they will not "Fit In" with society. With the modern technology growth, in such a rapid pace that it is. We all lack the knowledge of good old-fashioned simplicity. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".

We of the world look for the fastest, most convenient way to "Fit In" with society. From the fashion industry, industrial businesses, computer software, music, travel, to household appliances and communications we are advancing daily. "What's in today will be out tomorrow". What ever happened to enjoying life for the simple things?

"Fitting In" with society's modern technological growth will be impossible due to the record-breaking evolutionary expansion of the human mind itself. On another note, we here are people trying to "Fit In" on a political point of view. This particular subject is rather amusing because they are trying so hard to "fit in". As a person on a political stage, they are hanging from invisible strings. These strings are controlled by polls of society's member's views on issues. The one with the highest percentage is the bandwagon they tend to jump on to "Fit In" with the majority. Because we all know, "the majority rules".

So "Fitting In" is sometimes just for convenience, to advance one's self to be politically correct. This form of politically fitting in is really nothing new. In the end the truth is always revealed -- that it was all a devious plot to gain political fame. This brings be to fashion, music, and movies. I have a little more respect for their forms of business because they create style and entertainment.

People relate to images and "fit them in" to their own lifestyles. These industries use the imagery to create style for the public. Fitting in with society today is about self-image, idolizing, and expression through choices we make. I will use rock & roll and rap music as prime examples of how lifestyle, image, and fitting in work together.

Music in general has always been a way to express emotions or experiences in a way that other people can relate to. Most people thought these new forms of music wouldn't last. Those same people now find themselves relating to this music because it is everywhere. In the movies, on T.V. in their homes; now they are relating just to fit in. Fashion only capitalizes on these images and produces what the public is demanding (which is the image that society relates to).

In the end, "Fitting In" could be summed up in a few simple words: morals, self-image, and understanding. Sometimes fitting in with the crowd is not the best choice. Fitting in is being comfortable with yourself and understanding what you represent as a person. Then choose how to express yourself in simple ways and control what fits in to your lifestyle.
