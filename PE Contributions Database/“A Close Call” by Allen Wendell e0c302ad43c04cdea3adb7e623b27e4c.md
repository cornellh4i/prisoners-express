**“A Close Call” by Allen Wendell**

June 27 2004 10:something pm

I was walking form a corner store (711) located across the street from where I lived at... (Norfolk, Virginia) When I was approached by masked robbers. He asked me for all of my belongings. In which I didn’t really have much to give him ($175, gold necklaces, and gold earrings) and somehow I still wasn't trying to let him have that..

My mind was racing as my reactions was reacting without any thought… I swung my fist at his face and knocked him down on the ground.. I didn’t go for his gun that was supposed to have been still tucked on his waistline.. The other guy that was with him, was stunned and didn’t really know what to do.. I also didn't know if he had a gun as well, we kind of just looked at each other. Pondering on who was going to make the first move.. By then, the other guy was getting up from off the ground and they both just took off running towards this grey GEICO insurance building which was on the opposite side of the street.

In that instant, I turned around, so that I could make my way back to my house. Where I had an all black 32 caliber handgun under the couch in my living room... Before I was able to reach my house. A green Ford Focus pulled up behind me and the guyI knocked down jumped from out of the driver's seat and pulled his gun out on me. (reaching over the top of the car) being stupid by trying to show my toughness. I didn’t run!!

I never heard a shot. Nor did I actually ever see the gun, (I didn’t have my glasses on) but I fell down to the ground after I heard the first shot rang off. I bounced back up to my feet and tried to run, but my leg wouldn’t allow me to take another step, so I fell back down.

The pain wasn’t what I thought that it would’ve been.. It just felt like someone had a hot iron pressed against my leg… I rolled over on my back, so that I could look to see if the two robbers was coming to finish me off, or at least take my belongings, but when I was finally able to look in the direction that they were in... I noticed the green car speeding away…

I was shot one time in my leg. Right (back part of my thigh). It was internal bleeding and I was hit in my main artery... I was laid up in the hospital for 13 days and I went through 2 surgeries. I was also told that I would never be able to walk again…

So this was my Close Call, because God was giving me a testimony.. He gave me another chance at life and another chance to walk again…

What if, I would’ve made it back to my house? I probably would’ve shot and killed one of them, God was definitely on one of our sides, because it was a blessing that I wasn’t killed from that leg shot wound and I was able to walk again, but at times I wonder if my life was really worth saving, because I still feel like I’ve wasted it and didn’t grab hold of the sign that was placed in front of me...
