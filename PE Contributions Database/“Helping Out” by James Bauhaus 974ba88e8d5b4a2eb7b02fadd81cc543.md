**“Helping Out” by James Bauhaus**

I help out all I can. Just last week I helped our Unit Manager realize that not all of us captives are full of kisses and licks for the boot that kicks. Occasionally, one or another of us grows some teeth. Reyes came to get 3 of us during one of their many senseless lockdowns. He wanted us to sign papers that signify that the bureaucrats are both needed and doing their jobs. Reyes began squawking about 2 of us having been demoted. He saw my face, identified me as a “troublemaker” pointed out to him by his flunky, as ms Machode. He kept up his fire, thickly accented, insulting and belittling chatter even as I initiated his pre-signature sheet. It said, next to my name, “remains at level four”. I said nothing. Correcting a kop is like slapping his face, doing so only forces us all to take the scenic route through these bureaucratic ordeals. It’s a much shorter and faster trip through their minefields to just try and accept the gratious suckerpunches.

**~~The 3rd guy had the same strategy: he quickly admitted having been caught at sex with another kid, signed and hurried away.~~** The 2nd guy signed and ran. Reyes read mine to me lst, then asked, “any questions?” I notices a cryptic note on the thing, where the computer had chopped off half of an entry so that it would fit in the blank. It was an infraction, 3 years ago, for “interfering with TAR”...

“What’s this?” I asked, not having any idea what akop could have put on me so long ago.

Reyes tried to check, but seemed unable to operate his computer. (the reports had been made and printed out by Ms. Machode, who was out sick, forcing her boss to act like a case manager.) Reyes, frustrated, gave up quickly. He said “It’s nothing. Sign it anyway.”

I recommended, “Put the mouse on it and doubleclick”.

Reyes, a very nervous and hyper person to begin with, took extreme offense at my getting to familiar with his computer. Instead of submitting to the suggestion of an inferior, he snapped, “you know what you did! You had to sign for your write-up! You are not some 14 year old boy…!”

Now Reyes has set me off, since I am the king of sarcasm. I interrupt him loudly, “You guards are in charge of telling me what you have written on papers you insist that I sign! Tell me what it is or remove it if you want me to sign!”

Reyes went nuts at my “sass”. He began bellowing for me to leave. I went back to the cage and wrote about this incident to the director after the kops simply ignored 3 requests to staff on his incompetence, insolence, and inability to follow his training on how to “defuse” instead of instigating incidents.

While I was going out of my way to help Reyes become a less explosive kop, the ACA came by to “inspect” the place. (The American Correctional Association isa group of kops who “certify” prisons in return for annual payment of dues, apparently.)

We got 3 days worth of much better chow out of the deal. On the last day, one of the inspectors took over Reye’s office and sent him to come get me for an exclusive, private interview. (Three weeks before, a scared female stranger showed up at each of these mini prisons to post an ACA notice and run away before too large of a group of stalkers gathered to mob her. One of the horndog kids shouted at her “why don't you come all the way in here and post it on the bulletin board over there?!” She made a threat that the bulletin board would be removed soon, then hurriedly made her escape). Reyes was very curious as to the woman’s interest in me. (Only days ago, the director had sent one of GEO’s lieutenant kops to interview me on my written complaint against Reyes. No doubt, Lt. Inserra had “investigated” Reyes too.) Like a sly snake, he innocently asked, “you were expecting this?” as if we were pals now.

I had no idea what these kops were up to, and I told him so. He did not believe mee, mostly because I made him wait. I grabbed a folder that held all the paperwork that I had put on Reyes, hoping that it was the reason for the ACA woman wanting to talk to me.

It wasn’t. Instead, she wanted to talk about one of the 17 letters I sent to various government agencies, politicians, media outlets, and civil rights organizations over 19 months complaining about the food. The kops stole all the fruit from our diet because of a few alcoholics determined to rot-up something to drink. They’ve been so successful at it that the wardens are spreading this illegal mass-punishment nonsense to all of their other prisons. So she listened. Afterward, I got the idea of throwing a mandamus on the FDA over the unhealthy, inadequate diet, and the FTC over the canteen price gouging that violates the Clayton Act. I’m sure that this is the best, most efficient, legal, way for me to keep helping out!
