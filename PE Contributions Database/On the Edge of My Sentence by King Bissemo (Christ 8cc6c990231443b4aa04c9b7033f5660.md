**On the Edge of My Sentence by King Bissemo (Christ Bissemo)**

A thousand years ago it seems like it has been

Since I was gone

Deep inside the cave, dungeon, or mine

It seems like I was for a whole millennia confined.

Sunlight I’ve dreamed of

Since the very first day of my incarceration

Sunlight I’m now fearing to perhaps have become harmful to both

My eyes and skin no matter my complexion.

Oh, of my re-entry I’ve been dreamin’

Alas, the society I’m now fearin’

In it I may perhaps not anymore fit

From the old school I am, today’s society got a new beat.

All the intimidations from the new

Tech, sounds, rhythms, fashion, law and order challenging my view

It’s like stepping on Earth

With an extraterrestrial mind, puff!

Here on the edge

Of my long sentence I’m standing still

Unable to move ahead

To meet my longtime will.

Oh here at the last corner

Of my jungle’s horrible journey I am

Fearing to move up an’

Go confronting the strange life of high-tech and law and order.

I may perhaps not fit in anymore

Of PTSD, stocky mind and constant memory blackout I’ve beaten the record

I may never be able to catch up with the rhythm

Beats, moves, styles and all. So old I now am,

With so little in mind to enable me

To navigate through the web of today’s rhythm of the city.

Oh here I am standing still!

Like an old statue on the edge of my hole.

Sunlight is so aggressive, the smell of the city is so aggressive

My body is so tired and my mind so naive

Incarceration that was meant to correct me

Has only destroyed me.

In spectrum I now walk and live

Will somebody please file a lawsuit on my behalf!

A mental health pre-existing condition due to my incarceration

I now do live with.

Here I stand still and can’t move!

My paranoiac and stocky mind is now telling me

Sunlight will persecute me

Oh paranoiac and stocky mind is now telling me

Sounds and rhythms of the city will persecute me

Employers will threaten me

Law and order enforcers will prey on me.

Oh here I stand still

Like a thousand years ago it seems to have been

Since I was gone…
