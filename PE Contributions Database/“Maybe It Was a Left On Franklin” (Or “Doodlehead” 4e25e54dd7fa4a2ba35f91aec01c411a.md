**“Maybe It Was a Left On Franklin” (Or “Doodlehead”) by Brent Seth Elskän**

“Oh, howdy, Ted! It’s Deloris...Oh, right, hah hah -- of course you knew that, sorry. I’m a doodlehead!...Oh, I’m good, can’t complain. And you?...Oh good, good. And how’re Linda and Jenny?...”

“Oh, my! Did she make it to her recital?...Well that’s alright then...Oh, is it now?...Hah hah, okay, I’ll tell Randal ...”

“Yep, Daniel’s doin’ fine up there, still hittin’ the books... Yeah, yeah, double major, of course. Makes me wish I was still young enough to burn the candle at both ends, hah hah....”

“Oh! That reminds me! How’s Marley? … Oh, my … Oh, now that’s too bad. ...Uh-huh… Well, look, you tell her I’m puttin’ her on my church prayer roll and that we’re all pullin’ for her, okay? … Yep, bless you all…”

“Well, yep, now that you ask, I am callin’ for a bit of help… Yeah, you know I’m useless with that GPS stuff, and I guess I wrote down your directions wrong, and… yeah, a bit lost…”

“Mm-hm, I got to Buena Vista fine, but somewhere along the way I guess I took a wrong turn, and I can’t even see a road sign anymore...Yeah, I passed the 7-11…”

“Well, there’s a great big mountain ahead of me, a row of, oh...maybe 30-foot tall pine trees on the left, and I think those are birches on the right, there. I’m parked next to a stream, and it’s pretty snowy out there...Well, I’d get out and check, but that’s bera’s still at the spare tire...Oh, I didn’t tell you? Yeah, big black bear, took my hand right off...Um, about two inches above the wrist i’d say. ….Oh, that’d be nice -- I don’t want to use my Triple A for such a little thing. So em-bear-assing, y’know? Hah hah...Okay, Ted, thanks.okay.”
