**“My Sable” by The Second Story Man**

I never owned corvettes nor capris, but I once had a cutlass that flew like the breeze.

To her credit, Sable has a gold medallion and a silver citation, but with no focus, esteem, mystique, nor intrigue, she sits there on the edge in quiet contemplation thinking about her legend and legacy.

Though comfortable in blazers, dusters, and wranglers by day and foxes and rabbits by night, she has a thing for nomads, ramblers, renegades and country squires while monarchs, matadors and dynasties aren’t her style, she sets her sights on a new conquest. With only Bobcats, Lynx and Cougars, along with all the badgers, capres, crabs and quails in her midst, she chose a safari and brought home a jaguar.

Sable was quite the card in the shuffle, right on track in the locomotion and a busy bee doing the hustle. Even though she liked the Tempo, she didn’t enjoy the dance.

Now this brief introduction into the life of sable isn’t true. She is just the vehicle that this second story man sometimes uses to get away from this Spartan draconian world of mine where day and night comes at the flip of a switch, the seasons by the twist of a dial, and the change in climate by the push of a button. Therein lies my story.
