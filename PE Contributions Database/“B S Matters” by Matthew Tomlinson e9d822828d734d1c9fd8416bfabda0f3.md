**“B.S. Matters” by Matthew Tomlinson**

Following is a letter to the editor of Amarillo Globe-News newspaper. I thought Prisoner Express readers might like to share this. Here’s how to instigate controversy in 200 words or so.

National Public Radio said that Texas governor Greg Abbott deployed 1000 National Guard troops along the Mexican border. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) needs all the help they can get. At John 10:2 Jesus Christ said: “Verily, verily I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.” Any Illegal Border Crosser (IBC) is a thief and a robber.

Declare IBCs to be a threat to national security. At John 10:10 Jesus said: “the thief cometh not but for to steal, kill, and destroy.” Declare border areas to be Border Security Zones, or B.S. Zones. Build a highway fronting the border itself. Call it Patriot Road. Establish all the ICE Detention Facilities (ICE Boxes) needed. Place every IBC in the ICE Box.

President Trump wants Mexico to finance his border wall. Charge Mexico a B.S. Fee of $100 every day for each Mexican in the ICE Box. Deduct this directly from foreign aid to Mexico. Tax every Mexican import. Tariffs will finance the border wall, Patriot Road, ICE Boxes, and related expenses.

B.S. makes the flowers grow. Let’s have blooming security along the border.

Now it’s not yet known whether Dave Henry, Director of Commentary, Amarillo Globe-New, will print the letter. It might be ruled to be hate speech. Folks hate it when truth is plainly told in clear words.

Read the letter again. Count each word. Let each word be a seed in your mind. Then at the appropriate season let these seeds blossom and bloom into your own flower bed full of colorful prose. Instigate controversy. Make people think for a change. A 200 word letter to the editor can change much.

Carol, thanks for being the eternally beautiful flower in my life. Things have been a bed of roses: a few blooms with a lot of thorns. But remember that I love you.
