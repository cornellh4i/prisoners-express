**"The Rock" by Randall Neal**

Here I stand. A mere four walls and a roof created out of stone. I was built upon this rock, my door forever open. An open invitation to whomsoever sought refuge from the storm. Not an ordinary storm, but a storm that’s been brewing for thousands of years. An evilistic storm that sent a massive wave of fervent heat across the lands. A storm of death and destruction, pain and sorrows, tears of brokenheartedness.

I used to be surrounded by lustrous green grass, rainbows of flowers scented the air around me. A sweet aroma of the creator’s natural beauty. These two trees stand tall beside me, deeply rooted to weather all storms. Shelter to the flying creatures who seek rest from their long and weary flights.

I haven’t seen or heard any of the creatures that live in the waters around me in quite some time. I don’t know how long it’s been. To me, time doesn’t exist. We all knew it was coming. The trees, the grass, the flowers, the creatures with wings, the creatures on land and the creature in the waters. We just didn’t know what day or what hour.

The creatures with wings flew high above us, watching down below, warning us all to be ready. They told the stories of the two-legged creatures that were created to maintain our planet. Instructed by the creator to plant, to cultivate, to replenish and to keep it beautiful. The creatures whom the creator entrusted to love one another as he loved them.

You see, we all recognize the creator for who he is. We don’t try and make him who we want him to be. The flying creatures with wings work diligently for him day after day. Forever spreading seeds of new beginnings all over the world. They never complain about their work, for they understand their very purpose for being. They never worry for the things they need, their food, their clothing, their shelter. The creator provides all.

We all watched the two-legged creatures begin to perish. It started thousands of years ago when they began to covet one another’s possessions. Never satisfied, never content with what they had. The deep desire for more began to grow. They began stealing from one another and killing one another for the monetary gain. Rivers of blood shed for the single sake of greed. They had no cares for the laws of the creator, they simply made their own.

The humans wanted to create their own world. A perfect world of power and domination. No one submitted to no one. Women seeking power over men. Men seeking power over everything. They rebelled against their creator. After all, they were more wise in their own imaginations. One world power was believed to be the answer. They began to create bigger weapons of mass destruction. Any kind of destruction. Even their children’s games were teaching them destruction. Their intellectual technology enhanced their destruction. Their very greed led their way to destruction. These highly sophisticated two-legged creatures, where are they now?

For days since the storm, the flying creatures have searched for signs of life. They searched the ways to the North, only to return. They searched the ways of the south, to no avail. They searched the ways of the west, finding no refuge. The creature with wings they call an eagle led the others this morning to search the ways of the east. One last chance of hope.

We all liked the two-legged creatures for the most part. Not all sought destruction. Some built their lives on the rock. We’re all in hopes that these humans are still standing tall like the trees beside me. Deeply rooted. This time the flying creatures have been gone overnight. A new dawn is beginning to rise. The bright ray of hope shines through the gloomy grey skies.

A dolphin leaps into the air, chattering praises to the creator for the newness of life. I hear the eagle in the distance, singing a brand new song. I can faintly see something in his beak. Yes, I see hope on the horizon as I stand behind this cross. A new earth. A beautiful earth. Clean. Plentiful. Peaceful.

Fruits producing from the trees of life. Leaves bringing healings to the nations of the two-legged creatures that still stand tall after the storm. The humans are gathered before the great rock that came from the east. They are learning the ways of love. Their tools of mass destruction transformed into tools of cultivation. Hope shines brightly for their children.

Yes, a new dawn is rising, cultivating laughter, joy, peace, and love. As I stand firmly on this rock, hope is now in my sights. Hope riding on the wings of change. The eagle now lands before me, carrying in it’s beak a new lilly from a field. Hope. Yes. There is hope when you build upon the rock.
