Honor Our Grandparents by Corey Higgins

Some say we are an image of our fathers and mothers, and they are of theirs’. We hold our family genes in our body, our heart, and in our minds. So we try to not only to hold our family genes in honor, but also make our grandparents proud. Though we sometimes fall short or fail does not mean we still are not a part of what our grandparents was a part of.

My grandparents were a little different than most, but we still remember their hard work and hard lives. But it seems they knew how to enjoy life a little better than how we do now, or so I think. We go on and on trying to show just how we were taught to do stuff or what our grandparents did in their lives. Now my grandparents studied and taught people about two things mostly in their lives. One was out in the open, and the other one was a family secret only taught to other family members of our bloodline.

The first one is their love for art. They believed everything we did held an art form. As for my grandpa, he built very nice houses and studied math. He also became one of the best air force men they had, or so I was told. My grandma was a house-wife who sewed and cooked, and we all know both are parts of the biggest art forms in life. She was one of the best seamstresses I knew, and as for her southern cooking, it was the best. Still to this day, not many cooked meals can keep up.

The second one was a study many people around us or people in our lives knew nothing about. We as kids never knew about it until the right age and then we got a choice to study it or live our lives as normal people do and it was only then you would never hear of it again. Most families grow up believing what their mothers and fathers believe in, and in this time and age, this was usually Christianity. But my family studied a whole different belief, a whole different style of life. We studied witchcraft, the pagan path.

We were given a chance to pick which path of life to take, study the family tradition or be someone who does not want to learn what your family has been studying all their lives. Now I went a step further than most in my family. I studied not only witchcraft, but Christianity along with many other religions in the world. One thing I’ve learned is that as long as a person comes to have a belief in something, he will grow in mind and spirit, and in due time their soul will find peace.

Now, though I’ve studied all different beliefs, I’ve come right back to what my grandparents were taught. I’m not saying it's right but it’s what is right for me, and in the long run, it’s what makes me want to live better, and try harder; and it keeps my family genes and beliefs in place. Where do your family or grandparents lessons in life lead you?
