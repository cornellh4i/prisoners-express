To me, a leap of faith is doing something that looks dangerous, like you could get hurt, or like it could end badly but still having faith that you’ll be ok. Like diving off a cliff into a 100 ft. deep pool of water even though you can see to the bottom. People may tell you that it’s deeper than it looks, but all you know is that you can see the bottom. Another thing that takes a leap of faith is befriending a serial killer who says he won’t hurt you. I’ve actually done both of these things.

When I was about 9 or 10 years old, my family lived in a little town in Arkansas right on the White River. There was a group of about 10 or 12 kids who would go to a little cove on the river where we used to swim. There was a cliff about 200 or 300 feet high that we would jump off of into the water. The water was so clear that you could see all the way to the bottom. Being from Kansas where all the rivers and lakes were muddy and murky, I would not believe that the river was more than a couple feet deep. So, as it came my turn to jump, I was paralyzed with fear. I watched the other kids jump off, and nothing bad happened to the,. So I knew it must have been deeper than I thought, but my logic kept saying that a river could not be clear. My brain wouldn’t let my body jump. Finally, after 10 minutes of the other kids trying to talk me into it, a friend of mine came up behind me and shoved me off. I remember thinking the whole way down that I was going to die.

At last, I hit the water and sank 10 or 15 feet. I kept thinking I was going to hit the bottom at any time, but I never did. Then, just like the other kids, I surfaced. After that, you couldn’t keep me off that cliff! I must’ve jumped off of it 100 more times that summer, but I never touched the bottom of the river. Neither did anyone else that I know of.

Being in prison, I come in contact with people that, for all intents and purposes, society has labeled miscreants or undesirables--myself included. Some people are drug dealers, thieve, or white collar criminals, and others are kidnappers, child molesters, rapists, and killers. In my opinion and experience, some of the best, most loyal people are those who’ve killed with no conscience or concern for the law or consequences. But getting to know the people I now live with has taken a leap of faith on their part and on mine.

It took a leap of faith on my part because these are the people society has labeled the worst of the worst, true heathens, and when you first enter this world, it’s frankly a little frightening. I, too, am in prison for murder, but my case was purely by accident. Of course, that doesn’t make me any better than anyone else, but I wasn’t as hardened as some other people. So I had to take a leap of faith and trust that they weren’t going to steer me in the wrong direction or take advantage of me.

For them, the leap of faith was in trusting me to not be a snitch or a child molester. They also had to trust that I would have their back when shit hit the fan and that I was a good person.

There are lots of things you do everyday that require a leap of faith, some of which you don’t even think about. For example, when you cross the street at a busy intersection, you press the button for the crosswalk signal, the traffic light stops cross traffic, and you begin to cross. You have to have faith that the cars see the light, that their car isn’t malfunctioning, and that they are able to, and in fact do, stop. That’s just one of the many examples.

The fact is that anything you do that you don’t completely control asks you to take a leap of faith and trust that the functions go properly.
