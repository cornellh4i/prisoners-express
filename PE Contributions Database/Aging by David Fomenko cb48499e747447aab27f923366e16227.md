**"Aging" by David Fomenko**

Aging is actually the irreversible biological changes within living forms on earth that eventually results in death. Although the exact cause of aging remains unknown, I'm gonna give all the credit to God. All humans and living forms were created for the birth to death cycle, which is uncontrollably unchangeable. Aging is a direct symptom of progressive illustration of life, and the assembly of the womb to the tomb concept. Truly aging to me is sometimes so hard to bear, because of all the people around the globe passing away, or just changing right in front of my eyes.

I tend to be skeptical about becoming older, or wanting to experience the aging process. Too many good people are here one day and gone the next. As a result of aging, people learn and adapt to the cycle of progression, because people actually have no choice in the depiction of life. As much as people would love not to age or change their features, it's part of the living boundaries that we cannot cross over. Eventually life becomes clear enough to see that what's done is done, and aging is just often thought of as a bad thing. So truly, sometimes aging is not all that bad, but is the most simplest thing that could actually happen to humans. Plus the verdict of aging will always override any causes to stop that process.

So we are born, we live and age a bit; we grow and age, then die. Some things are not given for us to figure out, but aging might be what everybody actually needs.
