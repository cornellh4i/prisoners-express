"Thoughts" by Anonymous

I go to my favorite bench in the park and dream of the future. I think of plans in which I can make money. I dream of becoming a world-famous model. I dream of traveling the world, going to Paris, Japan, and Ireland. I dream of becoming a renowned artist selling my artwork to all kinds of museums and galleries. I can imagine people buying my masterpieces all over the world.

I also design and sew and make my own outfits. Everyone loves my style, and consider it really fascinating that I make my own outfits. I consider everything I encounter as inspiration, and my friends think I should make clothes. Sometimes I make items for them as well. Maybe my thoughts should be on designing clothes singularly as I enter college. I have fantastical thoughts all of the time, and one of my many thoughts will eventually bring me the wondrous joy I experienced as a young child.
