**“The Narrow Path to Freedom” by Marcello Gibbs**

We as people never know what lies ahead in life, but we can determine our destiny. We’re entitled to make our volition as we see fit. But there’s consequences behind our decision-making, so we must choose wisely. And in order to have freedom, you must be free in the mind and then that’ll lead you to freedom in the spirit. Once you obtain this freedom in spirit, you will feel something extraordinary; you’ll begin to feel a different kind of peace with self. You’ll also be aware of doing the right thing and how to avoid straying off the narrow path to freedom. Many people will not take this path because they don’t value the importance freedom. The devil is the ruler of the world and our heart thrives on worldly things.

But if you just open up your mind a little bit more and search a little deeper, I’m sure you’ll find freedom. And you’ll come to the realization that it’s a lot more freedom out there than you can imagine. The world is extremely huge, but our minds can grasp power within our minds and souls to seek that narrow path to freedom. We’re in control and we hold the key. But it’s our volition to unlock that freedom and to be willing to explore this freedom I’m speaking of. There’s nothing difficult about it; it’s up to you and your will. God doesn’t pressure us to do nothing. He simply waits with open arms to allow us to make our own decisions.

I know I had been held captive by Satan for too fucking long. In and out of jail, state jail, and prison, damn near my whole life. Not gaining nothing but pain and losing my freedom back to back. But now, I’m more determined and I’m on a different path in life. That path is the Narrow Path to Freedom. I’m tired of being caged and chained up and going down that broader pathway. There’s no freedom in that. So, with all my might, all my soul, all my heart and all my mind, I will strive to be on that narrow path to freedom. When you are done experiencing things that I went through and the path that I used to be on, you would strive to change too.

There’s a lot of freedom out there and it’s within our reach. We must have that vision in our mind to be able to obtain it by any means. We can’t continue in our mind to be able to obtain it by any means. We can’t continue to be lost in captivity. We must expand our minds and open our minds to a new world of freedom. Love one another, encourage one another, comfort one another, and experience freedom with one another. I’m not saying it’ll be easy, but it all starts on the narrow path to freedom. You got to have that desire in your soul and the willpower in your mind to make it happen, but the choice is yours.
