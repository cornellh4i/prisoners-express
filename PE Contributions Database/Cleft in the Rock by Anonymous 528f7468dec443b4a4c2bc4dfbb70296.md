**Cleft in the Rock by Anonymous**

“It used to just be a story. How, then, could it be real?” asked the rear seat passenger. The old church was built with stones that had been laid upon the cold, moist ground hundreds of years ago.

We were just kids then, I thought, as I parked the Tahoe. It had been too long. These psychedelic musings of all that’d happened. Maybe 400 year old conversions. Tears over treachery in a desperate pagan land. Long-since buried parishioners nearby. One bad string of thoughts and we could’ve spiraled into the inevitable fears that it’s not a church any longer but our tomb.

Here, new eyes looked over an old scene. Times long past. Our paths as faded and dead as the cold tombstones that lined the nearby fields, broken and forgotten. Like far-off, long-ago thoughts of a smoking binge. We hopped out of the Tahoe and up the winding steps we went. The mild, almost unnecessary, grade to the arched doorway. The smell of lichen and moss tickled my nostrils as I opened the door. I paused and looked back at the tee-totalling agnostic. I forced the door closed again and walked towards the graves. Dear, sweet Becky. Faithless and always sober. There was no sacred understanding of the godly or the pagan roots of the British Isles. Nothing connected her. So even graves seemed less sacred. She mindlessly followed. Another spent effort.

It felt an empty gaze that she gave at times. Mindless and confused. At best full of lust. Unable to see the shockingly apparent. Maybe the whole ball of falsehood caused that look. Just dumb, at best warm. Like trying to explain the ancient history or even algebra to a dog. The cold hollow hopelessness embraced me as I felt a sad kinship with these long since buried brothers and sisters. Yet again the distance causes me to climb into a cold bed. Emotional intelligence was lacking. And cold sheets the symptom.
