**“Helping Hand” by Anthony Kenley**

My brother, Pete, has always been a helping hand. Need to move, call Pete. Need your car worked on or a friend to listen to you, call Pete.

My brother was also a firefighter. Talk about a helping hand. He’d respond to car wrecks, fires, floods, tornadoes, you name it. He was always a helping hand.

One day he’s on the farm alone. He’s cutting up an old forklift for scrap metal. He stupidly drops a 2000 pound counter weight on his foot. Thankfully, it’s on soil so it crushed into the ground. Wow, saying thanks it’s crushed here instead of there, huh?

Now he’s pinned in a back pasture out of sight of anyone and unknown to anyone. Thank goodness he has his phone in his pocket instead of in the truck.

He calls the fire department for a helping hand. Man! You should have seen their response. Firefighters and their equipment, ambulance, state troopers, deputy sheriffs, and a newspaper reporter too. All respond to lend Pete a helping hand like he’s lent to so many others. It looked like an emergency responders convention.

I have a newspaper photo of him being loaded into an ambulance surrounded by emergency vehicles and personnel. Life is a circle. Lend a helping hand and you’re lent a helping hand.
