Who of us have ever come to that point in life and said to oneself, “It’s time to face my fear.” For some of us, it might have been the fear of snakes. Some might have had the fear of heights. Some might find the oceans and vast spaces fearful. Or creepy crawlies like spiders. When my time came to ask myself what it was *I* feared, I said to myself, “I ain’t afraid of clowns. And I don’t fear heights.” And I kept asking myself what it was that I feared. I even came to ask myself if I feared death, but I don’t--it’s just nature’s natural way for all living things. We will all end up at that finish line sooner or later. So I kept asking myself what is my greatest fear, but deep inside, I just thought, “But we all must have a fear of something.” And I searched the world for my fear, and how I would go about facing my fera when I came upon it. I searched high and low and looked at all things: animals things, places, and people. I could not find this fear I must face, but yet we all must fear something because fear is part of life. Without fear, there is no courage. I have plenty of that, and so I twisted my brain with that thought. I realized that my fear wasn’t anywhere out there in the world. It had always been in me. My greatest fear was looking inside of myself, and the fear of what I would face once I looked in there.
