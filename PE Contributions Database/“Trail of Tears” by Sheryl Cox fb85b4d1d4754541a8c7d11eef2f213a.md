**“Trail of Tears” by Sheryl Cox**

Some people look at me and wrinkle their nose. Some say I’m withered from countless days in the sun and that I should have taken better care of myself. Young ones say I look like an old, dried up apple or that I look like a wicked old witch. Some say I look sad and worn out. Some say I’m just wasting space that could now be better utilized by younger, more vivacious inhabitants of the world.

But they don’t know what they fail to see. They don’t know the tales told in this line-etched vessel… lines that hold stories of success we celebrate or hardships my clan and I endure… stories of the way my people passed down from my ancestors. Consider each line or wrinkle a trail of tears.

A trail of tears of victory at having mastered the art of grinding grain to make bread. A trail of tears of satisfaction of learning to weave blankets to keep my family warm. A trail of tears for pleasure of the beauty of a finely crafted pot or the rich fragrance of a pot of stew or fresh baked bread.

A trail of tears for the love of my youth proudly riding out to battle clad in a loincloth, war paint and feathers, bearing a bow and quiver of arrows, then returning slung over the butt of a beast, his lifeless face ashen, his breast painted in his own blood.

A trail of tears because another tribe’s chief took me from my father’s tent to be his squaw, not considering or caring for my own feelings or desires. A trail of tears of joy for children I bore and strapped in a papoose to continue my work. A trail of tears of pride as I watched my sons pass the rites of manhood.

A trail of tears of gratitude for the bison who lay down their lives so my tribe could eat and I could sew the hide into robes and tent sides. A trail of tears of thanks for a successful hunt. A trail of tears of thankfulness for the years of great abundance. A trail of tears for the seasons of lack. A trail of tears for loss as fires swept the prairie land purging it of all we worked for and in.

A trail of tears for the times of physical and spiritual purification in the sweat lodge. A trail of tears from when my people were forced from the freedom of her homeland into places that could not sustain our way of life. A trail of tears for the times the whiteman broke with us the treaty he swore to. A trail of tears for pity of those who refuse to understand we wish to live on the land our way instead of bound in identical homes.

Perhaps I do look like a withered old woman, but I won’t hide. Just take a moment to see something different. See the love, the joy, and the pride of success. See the pain and the sadness of loss and betrayal. Take time to wear the moccasins in which I’ve walked so many miles… miles that produced these trails of tears of which I am so proud of. Because no matter what you say or see, I am indeed proud of everyone on my trail of tears.
