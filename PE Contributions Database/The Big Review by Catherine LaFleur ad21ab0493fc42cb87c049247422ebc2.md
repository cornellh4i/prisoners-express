**"The Big Review" by Catherine LaFleur**

Baker acted strangely on Tuesdays; his customers knew not to complain if they ordered something different than what the barista decided to push across the counter. The noise from the service counter, even the canned café music, set Dr. Peter Guzmann's teeth on edge this morning. Everyone at CuppaJoe seemed capable only of shouting their orders at Baker, who stoically mixed up order after order, indifferent to the rising volume. Peter impatiently tapped his Patek Phillipe, which showed twenty minutes to nine.

“Late, late,” he muttered. A woman's voice oozed into his ear. “I’m sorry to be calling so early but haven't been able to schedule you for an interview until now."

“What do you mean, Miss?" Peter gritted out. "I've been waiting for your book reviewer at this shop for almost an hour. I'm an important man, a respected scholar, and I haven't time for interviewers who can't be bothered to keep an appointment.”

“Dr. Guzmann, I do apologize. I’m sending someone out from the office right now, they should be with you at any moment. Reviewing your new book ‘Now is all You've Got' is very important to us.”

"I hope it's one of your senior people, not some intern who hasn’t a clue as to how to get about the business?"

"I'm sure your interview will go smoothly, Doctor.” The woman hung up.

Peter sat still for a moment. So they thought he was over the hill, too old to play the game, did they? He might be pushing eighty-five but he was still a player. He felt the lining of his jacket pocket for the tiny notebook containing quotes he wanted to mention to the reviewer. Good, it was still there. Picking up the newspaper on the table he opened it and disappeared into the details of the city hall's latest scandal.

She cleared her throat, a real phlegm rattler. That's what woke the old man. His head had fallen forward over his chest. He blinked, disoriented, at the young woman sitting at his table. She wore an elegant black suit with a long sheer scarf tied loosely at the shoulder.

"Dr. Guzmann?” she inquired. "Dr. Peter Guzmann?”

“Yes," he mumbled, sitting up straighter. He felt refreshed and the feeling of impatience he had wrestled with disappeared. He wondered how long she had been sitting there.

"I'm Miranda, I'll be taking you upstairs for your review. Would you like something to drink? Can I freshen up your coffee before we leave?"

Peter looked at the thick yellow cup in front of him. He couldn't remember finishing it. "No need, no need at all. I'd rather just get down to the reason for our meeting today, Miss. I hope you read my new book.”

“Yes, I have. Please, call me Miranda.”

Dr. Guzmann and Miranda entered an old fashioned elevator. The cage was constructed of ornate ironwork with gold filigreed designs etched in the metal. The door slid open and the two stepped into a reception area decorated in gold Louis the XIV furnishings and blue Persian rugs.

“Is it possible for Dr. Guzmann to be reviewed now?" Miranda asked the receptionist, a golden-haired young man in an impossibly loud and gaudy plaid suit. The suit was so garish Peter had to squint just to make out the man's bright outline.

"Let me ask if everything is ready," the man rose smoothly and departed through a chased silver door.

Soon he returned. "Everything is set up, fifth door on the right.”

"Oh," Miranda sighed, “that's a good room.” She proceeded down the hall and opened the door on the right.

They entered and Miranda walked over to the rosewood casket. The top portion lay open to reveal the head and shoulders of the deceased. Peter vaguely recognized the man reposing in the satin-lined interior. The head was balding, wrinkles pouched under the eyes. On his lips was a hint of a smile. Peter stood looking down on the man but feeling neither sad nor frightened. He wondered if he was there to identify him.

The door to the room opened again and a woman resembling a younger version of his first wife Claire glided in. "Impossible! It must be my wife's niece," Peter whispered. He stepped to the side as the woman approached the casket. He reached into a pocket for the clean handkerchief he always carried. She stood over the casket looking down. No special emotion showed on her face. Then she turned to Peter regarding him for a moment with an expression of faint surprise.

After a few seconds she turned to Miranda, “Yes, it's him.”

"Are you alright my dear," Peter asked. He wasn't sure if she would recognize him. “My name is Peter, was married to your aunt Claire. Were you close to this gentleman?”

The woman regarded him seeming to think for a minute. Then she said, “You’ve made a mistake.”

“A mistake, don't you know who this gentleman is?"

Her eyebrow slowly rose, "Don't you know this is Peter Guzmann? He died just yesterday.”

Peter tried to smile. “Don’t be ridiculous. It’s probably another man who looks like me. Maybe it's another Peter Guzmann entirely,” but the second he said the words he knew it was true. He was dead. Oddly, he felt nothing. The woman speaking to him was his wife, Claire, deceased for two years. He'd realized if he were alive he would be feeling something, happiness at seeing her, shock at his own death. Only someone who was beyond feeling could remain so detached at seeing his own body, a lifeless shell, lying before him.

He tried to laugh but failed. The body and casket faded leaving Miranda and Claire standing on either side of him. Miranda unfurled her scarf and draped it over her dark hair and across her shoulders as a gentle mist filled the room.

"How did this happen? I was sitting in the CuppaJoe perfectly fit this morning waiting to meet the reviewer about my new book!”

"It wasn't this morning,” Miranda replied gently, "and you weren't very fit." She tapped him on the breast pocket of his jacket. “Too many bacon burgers.”

"I had a heart attack?"

"Probably," Miranda nodded.

In the cemetery, it was still and peaceful. A man with a long light-brown ponytail and a crisp collared shirt gave a brief review of Peter's life. “He was an intellectual in the best sense of the word. When Peter Guzmann came to America, he worked all day and night while attending college, graduating with the highest honors. True, he had some difficulties and both professional and personal disappointments. Almost every theory he had about God and life and death caused controversy, but he remained a scholar of the deepest integrity.”

"Those are quotes from my notebook," Peter exclaimed as he patted his jacket pocket. Of course the little notebook had been removed much earlier. “I’ve never even met this man," he grumbled, "and I'm not protestant, I'm an atheist! Is this all they've got to say about me? Who arranged this funeral anyway?"

“Your children hired him and gave him some of your books,” Miranda said.

Peter looked behind himself at the grieving faces of Peter, Jr. Sonja and Helena, sitting on the first row.

“Who’s the woman with the blonde hair on the third bench?" Claire asked.

"Oh, aham..... my second wife, Gladys.”

“Gladys, your secretary? I always thought something was going on!" Claire wrenched her hand from Peter's.

“I’ve had enough, let's get out of here," muttered Peter.

Miranda pulled the gauzy black scarf across her pale face making the sheer fabric into a sort of veil. “Where would you liked to go?”

The preacher finished his eulogy and the scattered mourners sang a half-hearted rendition of Amazing Grace. Miranda lightly touched Peter and Claire on the shoulders. They floated out of the cemetery to the street. Miranda lit next to a gleaming white marble bench engraved with the words bus stop.

Peter sat down and looked at the pedestrians passing by a row of shops. Cars honked loudly as they whizzed past on the street. “Is this what death is like? Same city, same streets, same stores? Even I seem the same.”

"Yep, but without a body,” Claire held up a transparent hand as she looked through her palm at him.

“So what are we supposed to do now?" asked Peter.

“Really, I don't know what to tell you,” responded Miranda as she peered over the edge of her veil. "Are you hungry, thirsty, or tired?"

Claire and Peter looked at each other. "No, nothing.”

"This is unbelievable! Crazy! Insane! The most ridiculous superstitions mankind has about dying are true,” said Peter.

"Maybe there is a hell or a heaven?" Claire asked uncertainly. “Should we expect an appearance from the Grim Reaper?" She glanced around the busy sidewalk.

"Anything is possible at this point," Peter sighed. "What's your role in all of this, Miranda?"

A blue and silver bus circled down from the sky and settled next to the bus stop. Miranda smiled, “I think your connection is here.”

“Yes, what are you here for?" Claire asked.

Miranda stood up with the couple and pushed them gently toward the bus door. Peter and Claire turned back briefly. Miranda extended her slim hands to each of them and solemnly shook their hands. "I'm the Grim Greeter, I don't reap anymore, but I do stop by and say to everyone who has ever lived, 'nice try’.

"After you my dear," Peter said gallantly, taking Claire's astral arm as they climbed aboard the bus that had no destination listed on its message board.

"Where do you think we're going?” she asked in a worried voice.

They took seats in the middle and looked out the window at the tiny city below them, the earth and all its rivers, oceans and continents spread underneath them. They could see the whole universe, then everything became completely clear.

"Did you say something?" Claire asked.

Peter answered; “I’m glad I have been wrong my whole life.”
