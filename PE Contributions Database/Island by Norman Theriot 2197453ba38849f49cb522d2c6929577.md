**"Island" by Norman Theriot**

This picture, although of a seemingly simple land mass, reminds me of my life. An island among a sea of nothingness. For much of my life I have been self-centered, proud. I never asked for anything, in fact I would do without before I would ask for something, I am still like that today.

All too often in life, I have felt the sting of rejection. I am shy by nature and I guess that makes me susceptible to humiliation. It is said that no man is an island, that’s untrue for many here are unreachable and are in fact islands themselves.

In this picture, it shows two trees over a small structure. I make my own comfort, I adapt to my surroundings I make peace with myself, and prefer others to stay away from me. There is much game here so I hide my true self away in a façade that repels others away from me. I don’t want friendship in here, as my only concerns are to protect myself, physically, mentally, and emotionally.

I can see only one entrance in this picture, the sides and rear appear to be a cliff of protection. Only people that I choose can approach me. Perhaps this is of detriment but it serves me well.

The surroundings are of nothingness, no places for people to hide or to sneak into my defenses. But some have, which have made me more vigilant in protecting myself, thus alienating myself that much more. A lone soul in a world of chaos.
