**Close Call by Terry Lytle**

He was as rugged as any ex-con: top-heavy, six-pack abs, chiseled out of marble. Got blue eyes that turn green, but mostly stay grey (he said it was from all the fluorescent lights, all these years). Has a smile that slays most women, and the dimples take care of the rest. Just did 53 months (that bid)-- out for the seventh time. About to turn 32 years old. A criminal…

Had a lot of close calls over the years. Car wrecks. Shootings. Pregnancies. Debts. Violence. It’s as if the merry-go-round of being in and out of prison, wasn’t the only the door revolving in his life. I don’t know about luck, but once I remember he was roofing work up on a house so high, the people in the back yard installing the sewer system’s hook up, looked like bugs. I was there… and I still don’t know how he didn’t fall right off that house when he slid down about twenty feet to the eve. Must of been 40-50 feet off the ground, him a-sliding down that roof on an upside down shingle -- on a 12-12 pitch at that! Would of been dead, sure as shit.

Had a close call, that October, though, that he just can’t forget…

She was as tall as him, maybe a hair taller. Tan as a pecan, straight black hair -- as skinny as any runway model. Had long thin legs -- almost saying “aerobics” in her walk. Had seen her earlier that day, blue jeans sprayed on, all smiles. Waitressing down at the local fish-fry restaurant, as flirty as a Julia Robert movie -- and just as pretty.

Sassy and smooth, she could seduce any $2 tip. Good service, quick on her heels I remembered…

And then, her birthday “get together”, later that evening… short-short soccer shorts, mostly tight -- should’ve made her blush. A half-top T-shirt, loose, no bra. Bare midriff (no belly piercings), and bare feet, tanned like the rest, red polish on the toenails. Beautiful smile, loud laugh, attention seeking; eyes searching, falling on me…

Quite a few eye contacts and passings as we made our ways back and forth to the bathroom...imagine such a grown woman -- turned 15 that October -- and an ex-con being thankful for advertised ages on cakes. Such a real life close-call, after just turning 32… and the gift I never knew I had: prison patience saved my dumbass yet again. Talk about luck…
