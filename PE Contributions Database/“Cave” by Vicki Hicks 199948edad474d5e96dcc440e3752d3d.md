**“Cave” by Vicki Hicks**

The majestic beauty of the forest. There is nothing like the Freedom you feel when you are with the forest. The many animals that have free roam under the cover of the forest canopy. As you hike up, up, and up a little farther you are able to enjoy untouched beauty. A place that man has yet to destroy to build condos or malls. Such a peaceful dwelling. There you will find trees as old as the earth itself they reach their hands to the Heavens as if praising the day. The Sun rises high up in the sky to spill its warmth on the tree tops. The forest floor is slick with the mist of the humidity. Now close your eyes and picture yourself right there. That is where I escape when life gets too hectic around here. Next time I close my eyes and escape to my special quiet place, I hope to see you there. Happy travels!
