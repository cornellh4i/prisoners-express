**Many Close Calls by Nate Lindell**

Before I was two years old, before my neural structures even organized themselves enough to potently manifest the qualities of my “soul,” my mature personhood, I’d been hospitalized with pneumonia four times. I had epilepsy, took phenobarbital, then tegretol until I was 10 and my seizures stopped. A feral Great Dane picked me up by my stomach and carried me off to eat me when I was about 7 (my collie, Laddie saved me, but was so tore up himself that he was shot)--still have the scar from that. Around age 6 a truck ran over me when I was sledding, then--the driver was so nervous--back up over me; the doctor said I’d never walk again. And my mom gave her best effort to kill me a couple times--still have scars from that too, can’t raise my right eyebrow all the way. Maybe worst of all, when I was living in Butte, MT, the little red-head next door tried to stab me when I tried to kiss her (all loopy from pain pills post-sledding accident.)

It. Has been. Rough!

And all that was before age 10!

Then there’s prison. Fast forwarding to Oct 8, 2018. I was stabbed in my head from behind with a knife (chopped out of the steel in a cell) that’d make Crocodile Dundee pause. Lucky me the tip was too slender, the steel too soft and my skull too hard, so he only severed one artery and caused 32 staples (more internal sutures) worth of damage before the tip bent, preventing deep penetration when he stabbed me elsewhere. More fortunately, I didn’t fall out from sudden blood loss until I was able to kick him in his liver then his ribs real good, making him back off. That was close!

Probably most prisoners reading this are already bored: “Been there; had that happen.” And I’m not bragging; I’m not proud that life has been a gauntlet for me! Anyone who thinks that such is cool, go ahead and have these scars, these tendencies to overreact, this panic when in new places or around strange faces!

The point I seek to make with this essay, a point I’ve sought to make before, is one that needn’t be made to those who actually care about people but one that I realize will never be grasped by those who condemn and refuse to understand people. That point is that most prisoners have been punished (for sins they didn’t commit) long before they came to prison and the carefully concocted punishments that are de rigueur in America’s prisons are, at best, futile.

When pushed in a corner, I’ve cut and stabbed too. I’m not bragging. The violence I experience prepared me, like a dog tortured to prepare him to fight: who’s really bad, the dog or the dog’s trainer?

No thanks to prisoncrats, I’ve committed to not using violence: my contribution to the revolution; my resistance. I refuse to contribute to the cycle of mayhem that is relied on by ----s to feed The Beast. This commitment is a struggle, but what helps me endure are the handful of dear friends I’ve made in and out of prison and my wish to spare others the sadism I’ve witnessed/experienced.

Love to all you P.E. volunteers and participants! : )
