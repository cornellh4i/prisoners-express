***Lost and Found* by Jonathan Holeman**

Going away and disappearing are easy. Losing yourself and your mind and walking away from everything are simple. Finding yourself is difficult, and doing so after it has been lost is nearly impossible.

There are pathways and roads, rivers and streams, climbs and falls within the mind. Walking along the crossroads is the point of separation between right or wrong. Every choice, action, and reaction to every event in our lives has a defining moment. Many choices are simple. If one is thirsty, drinking a glass of water in his hand is an automatic choice that doesn’t do much to register our entire consciousness. Then there are more difficult conscious questions, like what to eat, where to go, and why. Separate from these are the choices of how to react in any given situation. These defining decisions begin at early ages, usually with something as simple as a lie. As time grows and our mind gets used to the ideas and concepts of trickery and deception, these choices also become automatic. Having learned from experiences, our mind subconsciously yet automatically responds. We’ve trained ourselves to make these choices. This can be as simple as a person knowing how to ride a bike, tie a shoe, or what to say to gain a person’s trust. These can also be the simple differences between angry, violent, and deceptive persons and common people.

As we grow, we learn from experience on conscious and subconscious levels. Once we’ve managed to obtain a way of thought, a pattern to all the choices and decisions we make on a conscious level, our subconscious takes over, and we no longer need to think about how we react to situations. In many ways, we lose the ability to make new choices. Many people continue to live this way throughout life, most without even knowing that they have, in face, programmed themselves to certain ways of thinking and acting.

Once we’ve become lost, the only way to find ourselves is to make new choices, to unprogram. To be found, we must fight those natural instincts we’ve programmed. How becomes a matter of willpower. Not willpower to simply take new turns upon roads and pathways, to follow new forks at crossroads as they come up. Rather, the willpower to stop on the path and force yourself to completely relearn and begin all over again. This isn’t easy: imagine if someone gave you new shoes and a bike, and you have to force yourself to forget what you know. You’d have to begin to learn new ways to tie your shoes and ride your bike.

This is the only way to find yourself once you’ve been lost, yet if you can relearn, then everything will become not just new and clear, but easy to understand.
