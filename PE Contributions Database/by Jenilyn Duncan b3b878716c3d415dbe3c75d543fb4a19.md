A turnabout in serious business for the better. Taking a risk to be spontaneous instead of orderly, to switch things up, which can lead to confusion. This short story is proof that one person can be inspired to do things differently.

A charismatic woman who’s got good looks, who’s head strong and proud to where you can’t tell her nothin’ got hired and made a difference in my life. Business needed to get rolling and sure enough when I hired her, 2 few months later business was booming.

A man got closer to her as the months went on. They dated one time. She later reported to me that she said “No!” to his sexual advances. She also said to him and to me that it would skew the lines set in place and cause their professional lives to become confusing and tricky.

I’d say she had her head on her shoulders to escape the tricky business that the man was trying to pull.

I am so proud of her resistance in the face of temptation!

He was confronted about sexual harassment and he owned up to it too. From then on he kept things professional between all his associates, with no more tricky business.
