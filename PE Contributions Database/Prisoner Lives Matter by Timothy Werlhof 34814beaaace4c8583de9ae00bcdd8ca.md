**Prisoner Lives Matter by Timothy Werlhof**

“It starts on the inside”

If you asked, most inmates would say “it’s us against them”. Meaning simply: Cons Vs. Cops.

That logic couldn’t be any more convoluted. Firstly, there is no “us”. There is no truly united “Team Con”. How could that be? We are a large party

Simple. We as a whole are fools. We pick and choose what sorts of crimes are acceptable and those that could get you killed. That is the main reason for one divide. Have you not realized that no matter the crime, we are all doing time? And though one’s experience is unique, we’ve all felt loss, hopelessness, regret, fear and so much more. We all have the most important thing in common: we are caged.

Are we really so barbaric, so uncivilized? We politic and scheme, we prey on one another. What fools we are. My crime isn’t any better or any worse than yours. It’s a crime regardless of it’s nature. And just like you, I’m in a cage… Just like you.

How can we look at eachother and hate? No one understands what we go through quite like we do. So why don’t we look at eachother with compassion? Don’t we want that for ourselves?

If you are one of the many who truly believe its “Us Vs. Them”, then ask yourself if you even believe in an “us”. Secondly, I have to say that I’m not a fan of cops. I think they are sadistic for working in a place like this. But the key word is “working”. And no matter my opinion, they are being productive, contributing members of society. And I’m just a draw on that society.

There are some cops in here who deserve to be caged too. But I’d be a fool if I couldn’t see that most are decent people just trying to make it through life. We got this whole thing fucked up. They are so effective at their jobs because they are a true team. If they can put aside differences of age, race, religion, politics, then why can't we?

We can’t because the truth is we are selfish. You always feel superior to someone and you need that to get through your miserable day.

It’s not really about “Us Vs. Them” or even “Us Vs. Us”. Ultimately, its “Us vs. Ourselves”. Are you winning that battle?
