**“Santa’s Sled and There Off!” by Michael A. Carpenter**

“Faster man, if we don’t go faster we’ll never get this thing off the ground.”

“Yeah, this is all your fault, we warned you not to mess with the reindeer, but you had to go and eat comet and now the big guy in the red suit is really pissed”.

“This is bullshit, now he’s making us do all the work”.

“How can we ever get this done in one night?”

“Look, if those damn deer can do it, so can we, so just shut up and run”. 3-2-1 lift off.
