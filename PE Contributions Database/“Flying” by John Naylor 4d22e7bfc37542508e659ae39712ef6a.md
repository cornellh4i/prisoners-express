**“Flying” by John Naylor**

I can still remember turning off of 37 South on that crisp fall day. My brother, Andy, and I were on an adventure with Dad. The half ton ‘78 Chevy Silvarado bounced along the bumps in the rural round. We finally pulled through a parting of fall colors to a barn and farmhouse. Our destination. Dad wanted to see an ultralight plane that the farmer was selling. His barn was surrounded by a dirt track for his son’s dirt bikes. I sat on a snowmobile he hadn’t intended to sell. The farmer made it bounce and it gave a loud engine noise. Without expecting it, my mind was a bit surprised. Dad small-talked for hours about motorsports, flying and politics before he began to haggle. The slow country way. To this day, I can’t remember what he paid for it. He took lessons in Kokomo, Indiana before the veterans bought the airfield. He learned the ins and outs. Though he never flew his own plane, he still had it, disassembled, in the pole barn until the day he died. When he discovered he had large cell lung cancer, he was shocked. One of the dumbfounding impacts of it all was that he had collected so many things to do in his free time. He’d barely begun enjoying some of his retirement with the disability. But you know, I remember when he was working and younger. The twinkle in his eye and smile on his face when he was flying. Recounting it was like he’d just landed. Those are the memories we share and get to take with us.
