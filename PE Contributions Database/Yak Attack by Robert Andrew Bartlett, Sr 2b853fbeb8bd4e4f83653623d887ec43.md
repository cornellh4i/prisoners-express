**Yak Attack by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

The snow stopped just before dawn. By the time the patriots finished breakfast, the sun was shining brightly in a hazy blue sky. Nazir saddled his mount and tethered him to a bush. The men talked excitedly as they walked to the council meeting. It was turning out to be a fine day for killing Americans.

The meeting was mercifully short. An ample supply of munitions had been stolen from the Taliban. The nearest road was impossible. The occupation forces would receive no reinforcements in time to save them. Anti-aircraft guns were already in place to shoot down the first wave of air support. By the time any jet fighters arrived from Fort Floyd, the target would be destroyed and the patriots would be safely back home.

Nazi’s grandfather had told stories of how the Americans and British had helped drive out the Russians. Nazir had for a time embraced their religion; but it seems that Christians aren’t too fussy about whom they kill. When the Communists had finally left, the fighting had not stopped. Former friends had become mortal enemies. When the Americans killed his father. Nazir had burned his Bible, Forsaken his “Christian” name, and learned to fight.

The Christians had taught Nazir about salvation. Today, he would follow their example. Today, he would carry a real gun. He would kill Americans. Today, he would become a man.
