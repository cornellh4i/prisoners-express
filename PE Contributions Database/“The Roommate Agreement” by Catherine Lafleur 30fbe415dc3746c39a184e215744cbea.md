**“The Roommate Agreement” by Catherine Lafleur**

Arguments are a fact of life. I am an imperfect human. I can humbly state I am not right 100 percent of the time. Most arguments happen with a roommate, to avoid arguments you have to agree on rules. It is most annoying when you get a string of new roommates, new to prison, young, and ignorant of prison etiquette. My inmate mentor, Marilyn (age 65) is fond of saying “Start as you mean to go on”. When a new roommate shows up we have to discuss the Roommate Agreement. Everything on here is something that has happened with a roommate. Please share my pain.

Both Roommates agree to the following:

1. Agree to brush teeth at least twice a day.
2. Agree to take a shower with soap and/or shampoo at least once during evening hours.
3. At least once per week, agree to hand wash or send to laundry sheets, towels, wash cloths, underwear and any garments that have been worn.
4. Agree to fresh change of clothes to include underwear at least once per day.
5. Agree to avoid using the sink to rinse food down the drain. Will not utilize sink as mixing bowl for any food items. This attracts bugs and leaves stains on the porcelain. Will not use sink as a holding or bathing area for any animal, insect, arachnid, reptile, or amphibian.
6. No pets allowed in cell. No babysitting service for pets. Case by case exceptions made for cats and service dogs.
7. Use of sink allowed for: brushing teeth, washing clothes, washing hands or hair, and shaving on a limited basis (facial, legs, arms, **no genitals**) this specially covers maintenance shaving only. No bushwacking!
8. If significant shaving is needed, it will be done in the common shower. **ALL** genital shaving will be done in the shower.
9. Roommates agree they will not shave or bathe the guests in the cell, nor will guests be invited to bathe or shave themselves in the cell regardless if other roommate is present or not.
10. Agree to maintenance cleaning of all surface areas daily. Rotation of duties appreciated. If residue is left behind each roommate agrees to not throw a hissy fit and will remove the item(i.e. lone hair or soap fleck). If item is of such an egregious nature the discovering roommate feels offended or traumatized, leave item for clean up by the offender.
11. No purgative vomiting in the sink.
12. If either roommate runs out of personal hygiene items or toilet papers, inform the other roommate of impending shortage 24 hours beforehand. Each roommate will share or try to locate canteen napkins, paper towels, or other disposable paper products. It is in both roommates best interest to use these items on a consistent basis.
13. Roommates will not use washcloths or any reusable item as toilet paper. If this rule is violated, said item will be washed and bleached. Information will be kept secret.
14. Limited farting and burping in the cell allowed. Warning alert appreciated. Door will be opened to facilitate airing cell. Absence of toilet in the cell means no peeing or pooping in any area of cell.
15. If any type of accident occurs at any time. No hissy fits, screaming, cursing or other dramatic reactions. If laundry or clothing is soiled both roommates agree to inform officers and obtain caustics and biohazard bag for removal of items to Laundry.
16. No bizarre or unexplained behavior allowed. **This is non-negotiable**. Roommates agree to inform the other of any physical or mental illness. Specifically this includes mood swings, personality disorder, or transmittable disease or virus. In the event either roommate decides to stop taking medication, the other roommate will be informed.
17. No do-it-yourself dentistry inside cell to include tooth extractions with nail clippers or tweezers. No tattooing self or mutilating self in any form.
18. No contraband. Including but not limited to cigarettes, lighters, cell phones, illegal drugs, unattached razor blades, sex toys, or any other item that freaks me out.
19. Limited singing allowed. Attempting to sing on key appreciated. No tuneless humming or talking loudly to self and/or imaginary people.
20. All electronic music devices will be kept at a level which cannot be heard by ships at sea, people in the dayroom and most especially the other roommate. An exception will be made in order to blast on fabulous song to the universe, the listener will inform the roommate the volume is being raised. After the song the volume will be lowered.
21. Agree to wake each other up for count, mail-call, chow and fire drills, even if the roommates are angry, not speaking or engaged in all out psycho warfare and tit-for-tat battles. **This is non-negotiable.**
