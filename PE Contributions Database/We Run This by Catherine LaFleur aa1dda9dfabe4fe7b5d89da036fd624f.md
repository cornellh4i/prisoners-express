**We Run This by Catherine LaFleur**

It’s the party season here at Camp Prisoney Land. The kickoff is our wild and wonderful Halloween Hop. Although the costume choices are limited. Some have contraband makeup palettes. I have seen Cleopatra, a cat, bunnies, Bride of Frankenstein, and zombies all wearing class A prison garb.

Strangely the Poo-bahs are not very happy about this. It’s all a matter of perception - they say disguise - I say costume. After all the class A uniform of blue pants and shirt (or the alternate dress) could be considered as a disguise in and of itself … or a RLRPG of Where’s Waldo. Certainly none of my own would recognize me clad in such.

Although I do think Lola went a bit overboard one year when she dyed her white long johns with Siberian Tiger stripes and made a tiger ear headband out of white socks. Then she approached Capt. Big Mac Attack on his dorn rounds and made a clawing motion while going “Rrrrower!” You sexy thang, it’s straight to the SHU for you!

The Poo-bahs are going to have to do better. The SHU only holds 46 women. Our dorm holds 100. If we all do it, well how could they retaliate? Canteen, recreation, TV, and phone restrictions are not effective. It just makes us more whiney and prone to enriching the officer’s prison experience with non-stop complaining and neediness. Imagine an endlessly rotating line of women: may I have a sanitary napkin, toothpaste, a Tylenol, a request form, the TV remote, and running on and on. The only defense they have is to maroon themselves in the officer’s station and pretend to see nothing.

Which brings me to the Halloween Hop. Every year we have a theme. The last one was rather bacchanalian. The prep required assistance from inmates who run different departments. Generally in prisons everywhere, the inmates do the work, while the staff sit around. Our dorm’s girls go everywhere. Thus they got busy appropriating two water kegs from the Ground Department, two large cans of tuna, chopped tomatoes and cucumber from the kitchen, and a set of mini-speakers from an undisclosed staff location.

The day of the party was feverish. The chefs were busy cooking multiple bags of ramen noodles for the pasta salad, slicing apples and bananas for the pudding parfaits, and organizing the ice for the cherry soda punch. No need to stress about costume materials. The Laundry Department had issued us everything we needed in compliance with the administrative code. The origami artist made our crowns of leaves. The sun went down and the count was clear. The officers were safely marooned … Let the toga party begin!

Okay, I’ll admit, we probably did freak the fresh young officer out. By the time she took her nose out of her trashy urban novel, we had already chewed through the dinner and were hyped up on sugary desserts, candy, and cherry ginger ale punch. Our Tape the Tail on the Officer Game was still on the wall and we had finished the game of Pass the Orange with your Chin.

I suppose we shouldn’t have climbed on the benches and table in the day room and started dancing to Ebony’s endless party playlist. I mean the speakers couldn’t have been that loud. Officier Naif must have glanced at the cameras on wing one and noticed no one was there, not even the coven of old canasta playing biddies. Now, I am not saying the grannies were forcibly carried off to wind two and wrapped in matronly togas. It is a fact that no one made them do the Mashed Potato Linedance on the second tier, it was of their own volition. But that also may have drawn the notice of Officier Naif.

After all, a toga party is not something one would expect to see on a prison security camera. Naif couldn’t decide what to do. Hitting the panic button didn’t seem appropriate. Finally she called the yard Sargent. She told him there was a party going on down here, a celebration to last throughout the year.

Exciting news for Sgt. Bullneck! Then, Naif told him we weren’t wearing clothes which caused him to gallop down the compound. Bullneck is a relief officer from the men’s prison across the street. Probably men in togas are not as exciting a prospect as women in togas. He did seem a bit crestfallen to discover we were not naked but wearing shorts and t-shirts or at least all the appropriate panties and bras under the sheets. Then he pulled the plug to the speakers and ordered in a pleading voice “ladies please, please put your class A on and sweep up all this confetti!”

What can be said? It’s Camp Prisoney Land and quite frankly, we run this.
