**“Have Faith to Earth” by Shaun Blake**

****On a trip in 2002 to Boise, Idaho, I saw a man begging for money. Amazingly, I recognized him from when I lived there while growing up. We went to the same high school, and he was now carrying a big bag of aluminum cans, obviously for recycling money.

I remember him being a loner in school, always in the parking lot smoking cigarettes by himself or sitting under the bleachers to read and daydream. I made friends (of a sort) with him and found him to be quiet, respectful, serious but off-ish to any friendship offers.

I was shocked to see him. He was my age (35 years old) but already a little gray around the edges of his shoulder-length hair and dirty beard. His clothes were dirty and frayed, and he smelled ripe. It was apparent that he’d been living a beggar’s life, sleeping in alleys and eating out of trash bins. I thought about the up-and-down roller coaster life I’ve lived since high school and wasn’t sure if I should be sad for, or jealous of, him. I’ve been married and divorced, had 3 daughters by two different women, graduated from a 2 year college program, as well as from prison, and began parole for the third time--but doing well: working, engaged, and on vacation visiting family and old friends.

I figured I should say hi and give him some money. The problem, I realized, was I only had a bill that was worth more than I could afford to give. I cringed at the choice: walk on by without saying or giving to him, or introducing myself and giving him more than I wanted. I decided it would make his day to let him know that I remembered him. So taking a leap, I said hi, talked with him awhile, and gave him the money. His reaction was typical of his personality I remembered from high school--low key and reserved. He even had the gall to ask if I could spare more.

When I was home in Utah, I found myself in a situation that threatened my stability and a future that (at the time) looked bright. I had applied for a college scholarship for ex-felons that had stayed out of prison for at least a year. The problem was that I mixed up the application deadline and turned it in two weeks late.

The sum of the scholarship was exactly 100x the amount I had given to my old high school acquaintance--crazy, huh? I begged for mercy with e-mails, phone calls, a personal visit to their office, and finally, prayer. They agreed to include the application with the others but note that it was late.

My prayers were answered, and I was blessed to receive the scholarship which financially helped me a lot. But more importantly, this experience taught me a valuable lesson: we are all beggars at some time or another, and to give is to receive.

I’m in prison again, but not for a crime I committed. I have also learned recently that my old friend has gotten his life together and is doing well with a new wife and a baby on the way. “See yourself in the eyes that you look into because your eyes are there looking back at you.”
