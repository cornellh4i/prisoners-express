**"Reading" by Cesar Hernandez**

They say reading has many benefits including expanding your vocabulary and using your imagination. You can also learn something new.

I am so glad that my parents instilled in me the joy of reading. I like to read a lot. It disappoints me to see that my youngest sister does not have the joy of reading. At every chance I get I try to push her to read books. One time I specifically asked her how she expected to expand her vocabulary if she didn’t read books. She said that she would learn new words by speaking them. I don’t think that’s working out very well for her since I have to constantly explain words that I think are simple.

My favorite books are espionage books. I like to read anything. The books I dislike the most are “series” books. I hate reading a book that is from a series because usually, I will never get to actually read the whole series. I’ll only be able to read that one or two books of the series so I only get part of the story.
