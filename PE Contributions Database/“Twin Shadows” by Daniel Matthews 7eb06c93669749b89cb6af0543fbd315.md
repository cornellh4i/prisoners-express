**“Twin Shadows” by Daniel Matthews**

****Somethings we can never get over, I imagine, but the alternative is forgetting. You’re stuck with me, sister, or you can choose to be a ghost of my past. Do you understand?

--Manifest a severed shadow.--

I want to take you back with me sister-self. I really want to take you to make you understand what I really am. Who are we really?

Hurry, before new memories make me forget why this is so important, so you can live on. So the memory can live on. It’s not who I am; it’s who you are--who I was. You won’t know me now, but you need to quit lying to myself because we deserve to know my side of it. It takes a memory to realize how something has changed someone. Nothing else can do that. No one else except for the self.

--Fleeting shadows.--

You saw the evolution of me. You always knew me there, where I left you, myself. But I only saw you occasionally. YOu only saw me occasionally. Every time I thought about you, I needed you. I realize only now how much I really need you. I need you. Don’t change the memories because they fit perfectly. Understand only our memories are real. You don’t know me now, just as I didn’t know you then. But I meant all of it. I mean it, now, just as I meant it then.

--Returning shadows.--

Please understand that it had to happen this way.

--Shadows.--

So what I could always be on your mind as you were always on mind. Always and forever. Just like shadows, OK? Old friends and selves and ill-faded memories escape from us in this cluster of shadows.
