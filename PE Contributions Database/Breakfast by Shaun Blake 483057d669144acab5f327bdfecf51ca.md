**"Breakfast" by Shaun Blake**

I wake up from the sound of breakfast being called. Smiling broadly I jump out of bed, slap on some makeup, get dressed, brush my hair and teeth, and head down to the kitchen.

Today’s my favorite meal ever!

My stomach is growling because of the intensifying smells as I enter the room: fried eggs, bacon, hash browns, French toast, maple syrup, real butter, and freshly-brewed coffee. Stopping, I take a deep breath through my nose savoring the smells of this conglomeration. Then, with my stomach growling even louder and my mouth starting to salivate, I hurry forward, grab a large plate and some utensils, and head for the closest of these delicacies- the fried eggs.

Not any fried eggs but perfectly sunny side up fried eggs with a dash each of salt and pepper sprinkling their sunny little faces. I scoop up four of them, enjoying the slight waxily-acidic smell of fried protein and cholesterol- ahhh.

Next is the most perfect food in existence; deep-fried, hickory-smoked, thick-cut bacon. The secret to its perfection is in the deep-frying, for this way it gets evenly cooked leaving no part of the strips without the savory, greasy texture to sate any bacon lover’s palate. It’s salty, hickory, greasy, piggy, the deep-fried smell fills my snout, as I grab a large rick and set it next to their best friends- the fried eggs. Drool starts to run out the corner of my mouth. I quickly wipe it away with my shirt-sleeve as I move on to the next item.

This would be the home-style hash browns. These are cooked in butter to a crispy golden-brown on the outside, but leaving the inside slightly gooey as the starch, separating from the potatoes, combines with the butter. I also detect the pungent smell of garlic mixed with the salt and pepper and added to the hash browns- for an extra kick. These smells rise in waves to join the others starting to overload my olfactory receptors, as I grab a large clump.

“You’re not done yet,” I hear the French toast call. I hurry on. The frenchtoast is comprised of large, inch-thick slices of real French bread soaked in a mixture of thickly whipped raw eggs, milk, a pinch of salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and a couple teaspoons of vanilla. Then it’s cooked to a splotchy yellow-brown on each side. This all coalesces into a poignant combination of rich, fatty, yeasty, salty-sweet, eggnoggy, nutty, woodsy, bitter, spicy extravaganza with everything else for my nose and taste buds ( which I feel are already dancing on my tongue with anticipation). Snagging a couple slices, I also add two big tablespoons full of powdered-sugar, a jigger of hot, melted butter and a pint pitcher of hot, real, maple syrup. Hmm,Hmm,Hmm! I almost run to the table so I can stuff my face with this bounty. I hold myself back, so I don’t spill any of it.

Sitting down, I’m reminded by the rich scent of freshly brewed coffee that has edged its way back into my nostrils, to pour myself a cup (adding four sugar cubes), and a glass of cold milk and one of freshly-squeezed, pulpy, tangily-sweet orange juice (to satisfy my daily vitamin-c needs).

I bow my head and give thanks to the ultimate provider of this bounty; ask a blessing on it, the preparers of it and on myself for good health. Amen!

I start by taking my knife and fork in hand, make small cuts all over the two slices of French toast, sprinkle them with the powdered- sugar, pour the hot butter over them (watching as it mingles with the powdered-sugar, clumping up together), and then I smothered it with the hot, maple syrup (making sure I get it saturated into the cuts for maximum impact).

With everything finally in readiness I dig-in. I cut-out a piece of egg, and join it with some bacon and hashbrowns and a slice off the french toast. I bring this carefully to my nose breathing the scents deeply in, enjoying them immensely, and stuff it all in my eager mouth…

…Bang! Bang! Bang!

“Hey celly, wake up! It’s breakfast time, you don’t wanna miss out on the cold, lumpy oatmeal, dry toast, and canned fruit-cocktail. The state’s taken a lot of trouble to provide it for us. Come on. All you’re doing up there is dreaming anyway.”

I moan loudly covering my head with my pillow wanting to cry. I can still feel that first bite tickling my tongue and smell all the scrumptious odors of the best breakfast ever.

I’ve been dreaming again. The same dream (or near enough) I’ve been having at least once a week for the last thirty years when I’m incarcerated.

I can’t stop it either. Talk about self-imposed torture!

The worst!
