**“Sky High” by John Naylor**

*I don’t even know what to call this*, Jerry thought to himself. Thirteen years in this department, small town America alright! When the boss said to pool every resource, he didn’t think that meant the sheriff would have him in a zeppelin like a damn Nazi from old Hollywood. What a clip. What is it five, six miles an hour? How can I be expected to see a lost girl or her bicycle through dense June vegetation. So far it’s only been a couple possible meth labs and a marijuana which was so overgrown that it may have been abandoned. The pilot shouted “this will be something you will tell your grandchildren!” Though proud as he was of the zeppelin, he’d never know Jerry would tell it differently. That it was all politics for the upcoming campaign. That it was a ridiculous stunt. The poor girl was dead and buried in some God forsaken shallow grave, sold into sexual slavery or in some lone basement. He shivered at that as much as the press that would follow, shaking his head in discouragement. These things rarely work out. It was another sad story that should have eroded long ago. It only conceived through the eroded empathy of mankind. Inside himself, Jerry knew he was fighting a losing battle. What he didn’t yet know was how he could change it.
