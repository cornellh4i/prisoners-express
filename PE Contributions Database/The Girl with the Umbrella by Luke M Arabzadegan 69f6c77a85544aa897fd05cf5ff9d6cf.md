***The Girl with the Umbrella* by Luke M. Arabzadegan**

Young lady standing afar, you have captured beauty and innocence, as only a young woman can. Guarding yourself from the cool feel of the rain with your raincoat and umbrella, you seem well-prepared to handle the elements as they are thrown at you. But I wonder if you are ready to face the world at large?

The uncertainty of your face as I have collected this image of you here and now gives me cause to wonder. “Will he use this photo to add to his list of potential victims who are to play a role in his sadistic scenarios?” may cross your mind. “Does he intend to place me as a participant in demented games?” could be another. “Maybe he desires to peddle my picture to those interested in child-brides?” is a possibility you could have dreamt of. “What’s up with this freak?” is the most likely probability. I see the wariness in your eyes while you watch me, but worry not.

There are no bags under your eyes, and so I gather you are well-rested. The stresses of some teenagers have not worn you out, for I see no wrinkles around those lovely eyes of yours. I would wager you are still in school and that there are many girls vexed by your beauty. Your eyebrows have been well-manicured. There appears to be little makeup affixed to your eyes. How those vixens must hate you! No disfigurement on either of your eyes. Those eyes were meant to be on a movie screen, or at least in photos.

Offer no shelter to your beauty, darling. Let the world look upon you with wonder. The wonder of what it would look like to be as spectacular as you, you see. I’ll bet older women must pet you while offering pleasant words. Compliments shower you as the rain attempts to, no doubt.

Your nose has been delicately sculpted. The bridge appears unbroken or otherwise unmarred. No jokes dare be made at the expense of your splendid nose. They couldn’t speak such blasphemy. Have goddesses offered to let you be one of their ladies-in-waiting? Are not sculptors beating down your door to have you model for them? Perhaps artists are calling you to pose for them? If only in profile? They should, dearie. Let page-after-page show the world of your luxurious appearance. Busts need to be done to exemplify such womanly poise.

Full lips are played out. Why don’t those in the fashion industry put you at their forefront? With your consent, we’ll start a revolution. Removing the precedents put in place by those who have lined the pockets of countless doctors is our goal. WOmen’s liberation from the knife and botox injections begins with you. What do you say? We’ll take the world by storm as we redirect the public’s ideals, sugar.

Then again, you may not be ready or willing to make the leap to stardom. Your lips are parted in surprise at this chance encounter. Were this image not frozen in time, I could discern if your lips are quivering in fear, or if it’s just my imagination running wild. I believe there’s an inner strength within you that would make Joan of Arc proud.

That hair of yours! Oh, how it exhibits such beautiful body. I wonder, is it natural, or did you spend hundreds of dollars in a salon to make it magnificent? Nope, not you. It’s a natural, and how the wind has caught it slightly gives you the pleasant effect of a halo that accentuates your ethereal beauty. I’ll say you brush it 200 times in the morning, then 300 at night before bed. Such splendid locks, sweetheart. YOu do an incredible job of maintaining them. Queens and female presidents have called on you for coffee so they may bask in the glory of your beauty, haven’t they? If not, they should have! When their subjects see you on their leader’s dais, they will swear their undying loyalty to them. You could be the catalyst that keeps them, and generations to follow, in power. Think on it, love.

When you look in the mirror, do you perchance see what I do? The whole package dazzles me. Your forehead slopes in an elegant fashion. High cheekbones further enchant me, as they remind me of those in positions of royalty and the commanding presence they bear. Looking at your cheeks, I see something else awesome about you. They curve in such a delectable fashion that I wonder if you are part mermaid? Viewing your jaws and chin causes me to question if you are related to supermodels who grace the runways with such style. Your neck brings it all together by accentuating the smoothness of your skin. It looks as soft as a cloud. Have angels come to you and ask that you roam the heavens with them to outshine the stars? If not, please tell me they’ve at least requested that you be present when they sing, so that their voices, combined with your beauty, would persuade Satan to change his ways.

Dear heart, we can change the world one photo--one work of art--at a time. With your arresting looks, I could show your face on battlefields then each side would stop fighting to see who was in their midst. Give me your consent and assistance so we can raise this destitute world toward its much needed cosmetic enlightenment.
