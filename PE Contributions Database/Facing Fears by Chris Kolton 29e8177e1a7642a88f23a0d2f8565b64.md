****We all were facing fear at one time or another, and when I was sentenced to prison for the next 8 years, I wasn’t facing fear with the prison environment. The fear I was facing was not being able to walk my kids to school, not being able to see their sweet faces every morning at breakfast. The fear that I can’t go to school activities and help them with homework. The fear is not being able to be in their lives. When I was a kid, facing fear was going up heights and tall buildings, visiting doctors for shots, visiting dentists because of cavities, and facing the best pitcher in the league. As I got older, my children became my life, and my being away from them is a fear that I face everyday, and that is fear that they may lose love for their daddy.
