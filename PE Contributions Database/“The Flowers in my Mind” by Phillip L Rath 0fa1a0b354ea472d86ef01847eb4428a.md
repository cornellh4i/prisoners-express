**“The Flowers in my Mind” by Phillip L. Rath**

I walk alone, long-haired, bearded, VietNam veteran, with a “don’t approach me” scowl on my face. I’m in my own world of memories and don’t want to be bothered by the inane conversation of the prison yard.

Others are wary of me, perhaps curious about my demeanor or intentions. Let them wonder or speculate. I won’t expend the energy to enlighten nor even allow myself to contemplate their curiosity.

I’m not reliving the horrors of VietNam, the injustice of my wrongful conviction or the pleasures of past loves. I’m not regretting the hours with family or all the missed holidays. Partying, regrets and self-pity aren’t even in the periphery of my thoughts.

I am walking through the flowers of my mind, recalling the priceless lessons my grandma shared with me and reliving those memories spent with her in our garden.

I have no better memory of being loved than my memories of being in the garden with my grandma. Nothing gives me a feeling of peace like visualizing the numerous flowers grandma introduced me to.

I learned to make dolls for my little sisters from hollyhocks; to tell time by the flowers on Four O’clocks; to make a Snapdragon roar and how to make its pods explode in a shower of seeds. It seems that every flower in our garden had a secret or some amazing characteristic to tantalize my young mind.

Year after year throughout my childhood I experienced the flowers with and through my grandma. Every spring we turned the soil; Grandma with her spade and me with an old spoon, later growing up enough to handle a trowel and much later replacing Grandma on the business end of the spade.

Once the soil was turned and the clouds smoothed over we put the tiny seeds to bed, covering them with a blanked of healthy, aromatic soil and settling shower of misty water.

I was always rewarded with the honor of being allowed to hold the water hose to moisten the soil into a soothing blanket for the baby seeds so they would get plenty of sleep and wake up to grow into strong, beautiful plants able to produce radiant flowers.

Even this simple, mundane chore afforded Grandma the opportunity to share the wonders of our world and rewards of gardening. Putting the seeds to bed took a backseat to my having my own rainbow. I focused on creating rainbows and forgot all about misting the soil, while Grandma laughed and praised my rainbow skills. Sixty years later I still hear Grandma’s voice in every rainbow I see.

After the seeds were put to bed came the worst part of the gardening for me...waiting! Every morning I woke up and rushed outside to see how many of my baby seeds had awoken. I can recall the disappointment when day after day, not a single sprout appeared. I feel the same six decades later.

Weeding, watering, and waiting were the fundamentals of my following days. Each day I watched as my children grew tall and strong, changing every hour, right before my eyes, until that first bud appeared. I was hardly able to leave the garden, knowing that bud would soon explode into a vibrant flower...with hundreds more to follow.

When you see this grizzled old recluse walking the yard alone, don’t bother me...I’m walking through the flowers of my mind.
