**“When You Lose Someone” by Joseph Gelling Sr.**

When you lose someone close to you,

You depend or detach …

You either cling or distract …

When you lose someone close to you!

When you lose someone close to you,

Detach your independence,

Distract known remembrance,

Or let the truth grow close to you?!?

When you lose someone close to you,

It’s a pain that’s emphatic …

That detains like an epileptic …

Come let the truth grow close to you,

When you lose someone close to you.

When you lose someone close to you

Are you

Emphatic with detachings,

Or Epileptic like contractions,

When you lose someone close to you?!?
