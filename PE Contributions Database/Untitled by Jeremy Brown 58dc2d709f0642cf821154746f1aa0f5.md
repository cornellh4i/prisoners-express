I am old and blind, yet I can see more than you can imagine. I am a woman, an Indian woman. I could see most of my life. Now I see with my ears and hear with my hands. Itâ€™s a blessing as well as a curse. I have nothing to live for. My family is gone; my friends are gone. I have seen this great place turn from happiness and selflessness to hatred and greed. Every nation is divided due to cultural clashes. I think we will all eventually become grey. Grey skin due to all the interbreeding, interracial ethnic impurities going on. So be it: I have lived a full life. I have loved many, and many have loved me. Please, death, come alleviate my sufferings. This earth, my hell, no longer my paradise.
