**“Tracks of Freedom” By Douglas Knackmuhs**

For most of my young life, I grew up around train tracks. Seems like every neighborhood we lived in had a set of tracks running through it, running around it, or was within close enough walking distance from my house. Of course, looking back, I sometimes wonder if I wasn’t just drawn to those lonely tracks. One minute, you’re walking along the rails in total peace and quiet, and the next minute, the earth starts to rumble and a noise so intense that it screams inside your soul screeches. So begins the passing of the iron beast into the distance. I’ll never forget how it seems to take your breath away as you stand just inches away from this terror on the rails as it lumbers past you. When you’re only seven years old, and you’re surrounded by your friends, those train tracks can become a test of your courage.

At first, it starts out who can get the closest to the rain as it roars by. Then we dare each other to ride it and at first those rides were brief. Fear would not allow us to ride the train for very long; it was a fleeting glimpse into our own mortality.

As time went on, we learned to ride those trains like bicycles. I’ll never forget my first ride on that iron buffalo, man it was intense!

It took me a couple tries before I was able to grab the train and hold on to it. It went so fast that everytime I tried to grab onto it, my fingers would slip and I’d crash and burn onto the rocks below, the wheels of the train passing within inches of my face.

I had to recover fast and jump back up and keep trying. The train won’t last forever and you only get a couple tries before you got to wait on the next one, so I kept trying.

When I finally was able to grab the train and hold on, my body began to fly through the air as my feet left the ground. A scream escaped my body, part fear, part ecstasy.

Never before had I ever experienced a sensation so pure. The wind as it pushed against my body. The vibration in my hands as I gripped onto the side of the train. The strain of my arm muscles as I pulled myself up on the ladder rungs.

As I steadied myself and looked around at the landscape as it flew by, I felt free! I looked back at my friends and they were a million miles away. At that moment, I felt like the only person alive on planet Earth, and to this day whenever I hear a train I remember that moment. I may forget a million other things in life but that moment remains clear in my mind. It was a rush that no drug can ever compare to.

I’m an artist and trains played a pivotal role in my life because it was at the railroad tracks that I learned the art of tagging. Some of my friends stole spray paint so they could huff it, but not me. I stole my spray paint because I learned to use it as a way to express myself. At the time in my mind, I was just creating art. A troubled youth with no outlet to express himself except through his artwork.

I remember I made some masterpieces back then too. I always wonder to this day if there’s a train somewhere with my artwork still on it. Whenever I see a train out my back window, I admire the artwork as it goes by. It’s truly amazing how talented the youth in America are. Next time you’re stopped at a railroad crossing and you see that artwork as it sails by you on that train, take a chance to admire that talent for what it is. A raw expression of troubled youth.

As I write this, I can hear a train go by outside my cell. I’m over a hundred feet away from those tracks but I can still feel the vibration of that rain. Such raw power. A vital life line in American society, those tracks go from coast to coast.

Those tracks remind of freedom …
