**“In The Old Days” by Shannon Guess Richardson**

Days gone by always seem to be deemed “the good old days”. We can remember embarrassing situations and laugh at them. We remember loved ones with fondness even the ones who drove us crazy. Most people have at least some good memories of their childhood.

“The old days” are different for everyone. If you are old, your old days may be a time when someone else wasn't even born. If you are younger, your old days may not be that far in the past.

I was born in 1977, so I consider myself an 80s kid. The 1980’s are my “old days”. I remember the big hair, vibrantly colored mismatched clothes, my pink and purple POGO ball, leg warmers, and of course, George Michael. I remember great music and the creation of my favorite scary guy- Freddy Krueger.

What I remember most is visiting my grandmother and being able to walk around the entire little city- all by myself! I would leave in the morning, come back when I got hungry, and not be expected back in until it was almost dark outside.

Of course there was violence in the 80s - there has been violence in the world since Cain and Abel. There was a difference, though. As a little girl, and even as a teenager, I roamed an entire town all alone - day after day. In my “old days”, I was able to do that. It is so sad and unfortunate that kids growing up today won’t be able to say the same things about their “old days”.
