**"Women In Water" by Jonathan Haynes**

When the American bombers flew over, every Vietnamese person knew the only thing to do was dive into the nearest irrigation ditch, hug the bank, and pray to their ancestral gods for survival.

Even today, 40 years after the Americans pulled out, the landscape of rural Vietnam remains pockmarked by circular lakes, the craters left by 500 lb bombs dropped by the mighty B-52s.

No one can justify torture. But considering the mayhem unleashed by American pilots over northern Indochina, is it really so surprising that John McCain and other residents of the Hanoi Hilton were subjected to it? (Pilots were singled out for the worst abuse).

It is unlikely that villagers in Afghanistan will ever be able to get their hands on the satellite-linked, remote controlled reaper drone pilots operating from mainland America. I shudder to think of the torments they would inflict if they *were* able to do so.
