**“Retirement” by Jack Simpson**

This summer was going to be the best ever. Not only was summer camp in my plans, but there would also be kids around my age group there. I had never been to camp before. Swimming would be no problem. We lived less than a quarter of a mile from the Catawba River. It was named after local Indians who once lived there.

My family couldn’t afford for me to go to camp. No one knew who donated the money for me to go. I was so glad they did. I had promised myself that I would pay to help others once I made enough money.

After high school, I met my one and only true love: Mary. She grew up in one of the mill village hills, like I did. She was always kind to me, even in elementary school. We would sit and talk about each other’s dreams, whom we wanted to be with, and how much money we would have. We both kept our dreams alive.

I moved away and never forgot about Mary. When I would return home from a long business deal overseas, I would call her and see what she was doing. Not only had she started a small business, but it was also steadily growing. The seed we planted in each other’s head was now paying off. My new job kept me busy and with a healthy income. I could afford to take time off when needed.

In the summer of 1980, I visited a small remote area in Alaska. The locals called it “Peaceful Peaks.” The dock looked so inviting. I could sit for hours there. Talk about a spectacular sunrise when the sun just kissed the top of the peak. It was sure magical. With my eyes closed, I reflected back on my youth with my dog. He would have loved it here.

The grass stayed trimmed to the water’s edge. Nestling just less than fifty feet from the tree line, a nice log cabin sat. It was fully furnished and could be a perfect investment for the future. Any help had to be flown in since there were no roads.

Mary grew up like I did. She loved the outdoors and could fish. Most of all, how she loved to bait a trotline. She grew up with four brothers. Her passion was making lures. Mary has a competitive spirit. She could out clean her four brothers when it came to fish. That is why I enjoyed being around her. It takes being a strong, competitive person in order to survive in this world.

Mary and I went out for a social event. She had never been to a high society gathering like this. I listened with a tentative ear as we discussed business. Mary was mingling with the female guest. She always looked ravishing in a dress or plain blue jeans. It was really hard to not eye her the way the dress floated with every move. Ever so often she would look back in the area where I stood and smile.

Even in elementary school I knew she would be my girl. Our careers would have to come first. That was our solemn pact, that our feelings would be on hold until we were totally happy with what we have accomplished. No one in the room could hold a candle to her. Have you ever wanted something or someone to the point you felt like you would just die? If you didn’t get it, that is how I felt about Mary. She was forever on my mind.

I called Frank Martin at the hanger. It was eleven thirty in the evening. We both could be in Paris by four thirty in the morning, just in time to have breakfast. Frank was a loyal friend and a great pilot. He loved the speed of the Lear Jet, and how it handled. He let me fly a little, only with him by my side.

Mary and I sat on the patio of the villa. “I have never seen a place so beautiful in the morning,” she said. The sunrise was majestic. I asked her, “Would you love to live in a place more beautiful than this?”

“Do you know a place?” She replied.

The next morning we flew to the nearest airport and took a local float plane to the lake. Once inside she fell in love with it. I had already bought the place. Everything she had ever given me over the years now lined the walls. Over the mantle the locals made a sign and blessed the cabin. It was our last effort to be happy.

Mary and Bill’s Retirement

Welcome Home

We spent many hours together on that pier, watching the sun go up and down over the peaks, with her by my side. I am finally home.
