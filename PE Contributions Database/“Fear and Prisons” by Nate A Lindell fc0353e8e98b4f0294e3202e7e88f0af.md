**“Fear and Prisons” by Nate A. Lindell**

****Some people are more fearless than others. This can be caused by a responsive gene1 known as the warrior gene which shapes and influences how our brains function so that, amongst other things, a person doesn’t scare easily.

Ironically, both prisoners and prison guards, as well as police, politicians, soldiers, and CEOs,2 are far more likely to possess the warrior gene than the general public. Having the fene doesn’t guarantee that a person will develop the nastier traits that can manifest in a mind created by a brain that’s shaped by this gene. Usually it takes negative environmental factors (NEFs) to incite the development of nasty traits (e.g. living with an abusive parent or in a violent neighborhood).3 Those NEFs can train a vulnerable mind in harmful ways: to not fear repercussions for breaking laws or hurting people, to not fear the dangers of drug or alcohol abuse, etc. Those NEFs can create future NEFs.3

So facing our fear...lessness…

Both prisoners and prison guards are more likely to have this potential for a socially toxic fearlessness.3 But that does not mean that prisoners and guards are fated to be psychopaths. The warrior gene is also called the psychopath gene.

Yet prisons are typically psychopath grad schools where both prisoners and guards refine their lack of fear as well as their lack of empathy for suffering and degradation of those around them. Prison administrators (prisoncrats) typically conspire to inflict as much misery and degradation on prisoners as they can get away with, typically resulting in a prisoner’s mind being destroyed or their personality growing ugly.3,4,5

Evil in, evil out.

For the many out there who believe otherwise--it must be many, because this is a democracy and voters haven’t dethroned the prison cats causing prisons’ systemic degradation--please explain why we so often hear of soldiers returning from the acute NEF or war with dangerous mental problems but have never heard of a soldier returning from war with improved mental health? This belief that you can torment people and they they are still to blame for any negative reaction to that torment is based on the delusion that people have a miraculously, entirely free will.6 This belief often results in people who’ve been tormented from birth--such is the case for many prisoners--and responded negatively to that torment.7 Then they are further tormented by the prison system for that negative response, ad infinitum.

For society to knowingly permit the persistence of this sadistic cycle of degradation, society must be scared of something or hate something--same thing. What society fears or hates must have something to do with what might occur if society ran humane prisons in which those wanting to be restored to society have that opportunity--and even those who persist in their criminal ways are restricted from doing so. Or a prison where no one is incarcerated as punishment or held in punitive conditions.

A treaty ratified by the U.S. requires as much: “All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person” (Article 10 of the U.N.’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). The U.S. is a leading member of the U.N., yet awesomely ignores Rule 57 of the U.N.’s Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners: “Imprisonment and other measures which result in cutting off an offender from the outside world are afflictive… Therefore the prison system shall not...aggravate the suffering inherent in such a situation.”

There are many theories as to what some of the fears are that motivate people to at least ignore the nature of the prisons their elected government has created. Whether or not those theories are correct, nothing will change until people let go of their fears.

1. A responsiveness gene is a gene that “responds” to environmental factors, unlike for example, the genes that determine our eye color. The gene changes its resulting “product.”
2. A prison psychologist told me this, but it’s also revealed in texts like *The Mask of Sanity* and *The Psychopath Inside*.
3. As revealed in *Parental Incarceration* (Routledge 2016), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), what I’ve called NEFs, harm a child’s development. Most prisoners have experienced numerous ACEs. However, developmental resources and support (e.g. a grandmother’s love) can cancel out the impact of ACEs.
4. The most frequent excuse prison staff give for punishing prisoners is that it’s needed for security reason.
5. In describing the effects of solitary confinement, it’s known that, “A considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a short confinement, into a semi-fatuous condition from which it was next to impossible to arouse them, and others became violently insane.”
6. See “Do We Really Have a Choice?” posted on my blog *Prometheus Writes!* in October 2011. The article explains how free our will is and isn’t. betweenthebars.org/blogs/540
7. See *Parental Incarceration*.
8. With all the documentaries, news reports, books, and web articles exposing the nature of U.S. prisons, society cannot plead ignorant.
