**“Mountain Theme” by John Naylor**

The air was thin that morning. It took me a couple moments to figure out why.

“Who would wish to turn the oxygen down?” I thought to myself light-heartedly. It was my first trip to Colorado. Passing through on another family vacation sweeping the Western United States.

Upon opening the hotel room door and stepping outside the elevation left the morning air slightly cool. I turned right and wanted to see that mountain I’d seen at night. It was such a beast; it still had snow on top of it. Pine trees dotting it between rocks. It reflected the high ultraviolet light so much it hurt my eyes to look at it. It was truly breathtaking. I was mesmerized by it. And the air may have been thin compared to my barely above sea level adjusted lungs, but it was very clean. And I thought of all that Colorado brings to America. Like snow, winter sports and “sleepytime tea.” If you don’t care for cold weather then you may enjoy tea.

Another thing about mountains: they take forever to drive to! Because there’s almost no atmosphere in the western U.S. As a rule you will take long. Longer than you’re used to. The rule of thumb is that mountains are three times farther away than they seem. So one trip taught my brother and I. Because I’d always wanted to climb a mountain. South of Abilene Texas is Buffalo Gap. They have Beutes. Well I saw one in the distance of a farm road. Having a remote place to park I thought we should strike out. With only knives, lighters, water and a couple sweaters just in case. I brought some harbinger gloves in case rocks were a little rough. Then we climbed it after hours of hiking only to realize the sun was nearly down. Long story short we had to hitchhike back to our track. The time in the back of a pickup told me how true the rule of thumb was. Sure, we could have died. Impromptu climbing is over for me. Not because I’m scared, but because when I get out of here technology makes it too easy to do things more intelligently. Though there’s no way my brother Andy would have agreed to such an adventure if a phone told him how far away it was. I probably wouldn’t have either. Over 20 miles is a long way! But we did it, one way.
