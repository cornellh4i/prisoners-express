***Under Golden Arches* by Jonathan Holeman**

Working at McDonald’s sucks, especially when you are 16 years old, have a pregnant girlfriend, live at home, don’t know how to drive, and haven’t had other jobs besides shovelling snow or selling pot that you bought with the money from burgling houses. On the more positive side though, I learned how to mop a floor and had munchies to snatch up when my drunk, pervert boss wasn’t looking.

The guy wasn’t perverted with me since I didn’t have the right anatomical parts for him. However, I was the same age as the girls he tried his best to seduce. Being a 30 year old black college graduate who deals with bitchy, demanding, rich white women all day didn’t do much to build up his self-confidence. While the guy was a perv and gave me crappy shifts, he mostly left me alone to pilfer all sorts of fringe benefits.

Odd how that first “real” job affects all the ones that follow. I got through high school by being high enough to sell pot to many of the “cool” hippie educators, and I imagine many people find out about the garbage I did at my first real world span of employment. Still, I seriously doubt that anyone who hasn’t worked in fast food realizes how extremely nerve wracking and belittling such work can be. This is coming from a guy who went on to work at an amusement park, as a mechanic, at a recycling center, at real restaurants, in plumbing and construction, and many various less legitimate fields of labor.

Remembering that first job often makes me feel sorrowful, but not because most of the girls I worked with turned into heavy drug addicts or because the pervert manager drank himself into a messy, drunk driving death. Also not because I’m living in a prison cell in solitary confinement for life. What’s depressing about that first job is that I realized that I grew up in a society where flipping burgers and mopping floors paid less, and was less dignifying, than committing crimes. Preparing a quick meal deserved less respect from people in general than selling drugs on a corner. That’s not even the worst part: the real screwed up part is that over 20 years later, my own children live in the same damn society. It hasn’t changed in any remarkable way for the better, and it seems it only gets worse.
