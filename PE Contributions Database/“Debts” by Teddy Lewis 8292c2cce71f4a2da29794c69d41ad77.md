**“Debts” by Teddy Lewis**

Sometimes I look at the value of money in America and I wonder why we are the way we are. There are VERY dangerous situations in state prison that I strive to avoid, yet I openly admit to being tired and quite lonely and hungry most days in here knowing that debt is a form of slavery that its chains I must break. I owe God more than I could ever repay, so to start my own business and become an entrepreneur is stimulation to the point that I can sacrifice sitting in my cell with almost nothing for the sake of the future which will be bright. The debts to society are now paid in full during “crunch time” - which is crucial, yet critically acclaimed so even the parole board gotta respect that, ya heard.

Peace

I see that I’m in debt during this shocking reality of a man made virus that has forced our separate forms of pain to become indescribable. I left the prison mess hall still quite hungry during a time when the rumours of people dying from this latest disease does permeate the breaking table.

It’s quite bad not to be able to come to another prisoner for help, yet the reality is clearly that ego, envy, lust, competition and hate rule the minds of men in here so in times of need I have learned to do without and practice discipline as no other.

Our nation’s economy inspires me to envision having so much and one day helping so many. And now I go back to my sudden thoughts of the matter at hand, yet I worry not cause being in debt shall soon time itself away and be no more.

Peace
