**“Baby Feet” by Mitchell Womack**

Ever since we had a date at the beach as teenagers, my wife’s been poking fun at my big toe, which is about three to four times the size of an average big toe. And, boy, does she love to savor a good joke. Be it shoes or socks for Christmas gifts or a custom made gas pedal for my car as a gag gift, she always took advantage of every opportunity to humorously remind me of the family’s heirloom!

But, my, how the tables turned when she was pregnant. Now she’d balk at any mention of the big toe, and how our precious little girl would inherit this enormous gene! I’d even tease her, that she’d better hope the baby is born head first, and how I’d claim to see the big toe during her ultrasound, and, man, you should’ve seen the look on her face!

When our little girl was born, the blood hadn’t even been washed off of her before my wife started asking about her toes. Thankfully, for our little girl’s sake, she didn’t inherit this big joke! I remember when we took her home for the first time; I held her little feet in my hands, and had my wife take a picture, both of us chuckling all the while.

It still makes for some good-natured humor between us, although my wife stopped cracking jokes about it, because every now and again, something will happen that’ll get us to laugh at this inside joke!

That is, up until our daughter started giggling at the old man when my shoes are off; now they double team me, but I laugh right along with them!
