**"Dumb" **by Daniel Eester**

You can learn a lot from a dummy. That was the theme for car safety. But what about smoking? My suggestion? D.U.M.B. Dirty. Ugly. Morbid. Buttheads.

I smoked for twenty plus years before prison helped me quit. I’d tried several methods to quit, all of which failed. I’ve quit for almost seventeen years, and I’m glad.

If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you do, quit, now. I smell someone who smokes, now, and I want to gag.

Parents who smoke need to realize the influence they have on their children. I started because my dad smoked. He also died at 44. Fortunately, I quit when I was twenty-nine.

So, just remember. Smoking is DUMB.
