**“Freddy the Fox and Lucy the Goose” by Manuel Aleman**

“Damn you’re heavy! What the hell did you eat last night?” Freddy said.

“Shut your trap!” Lucy said. “I ain’t paying you to ask questions. Your only job is to get me from point A to point B. Now get the led out you scrawny little mutt!”

“Whoa! What’s with the attitude, girly? I was only kidding.” Freddy said. “I didn’t know you were sensitive. I’m sorry.”

“My bad dawg. I didn’t mean to snap at you.” Lucy said. “It’s just that I got a heavy load brewing inside of me and it’s making me a little cranky. Please, accept my apology.”

“Don’t mention it Lue.” Freddy said. “Besides, your tips always make up for your attitude.”

“That’s why I mess with Fred. You know what it is.” Lucy said. “The quicker we get there, the bigger the tip. Now mush my little ghetto husky, mush!”	“Geez, you’re a pain in the ass!” Freddy said while picking up the speed.

“That does it, wise-guy, pull over!” Lucy said. “I’m calling an UBER. Un-like you, those things are all ride and no lip.”

Freddy just laughed it off and kept going. “Lighten up Lue, you don’t wanna do that. Those UBER things have been all over the news lately. With your luck you’ll end up with a psychopath on four wheels.”

“You’re probably right.” Lucy said. “I’m better off with a scrawny ass on 4 legs.”

“Trust me, my scrawny ass will get you to your destination in 30 minutes or less, or your next ride is free.”

“30 minutes my tail feathers! QUACK!” Lucy said. “We’re only going across the street!”

“Maybe if you flap your wings it’ll push us along a little faster” Freddy said.

“FYI, my wings are useless right now, you little flea factory. They’re only good for smacking smart-alecks in the kisser.” Lucy said. “Say something else and find out.”

Freddy safely made it to the big building across the street and banged on the door while Lucy yelled profanities at him. “Open the door! Lucy is already starting to quack and cursing up a storm!!”

Dr. Goldberg open the door and a team of nurses rushed outside with a gurney. Lucy was so heavy that when they lifted her up, they almost dropped her.

“Hello Lucy, how are you feeling today?” Dr. Goldberg asked while examining her eyeballs with a tiny flashlight.

“I feel like my guts are about to explode. QUACK!” Lucy said while her eyes rolled to the back of her head. “I don’t think I could hold it in any longer.”

“Alright, I need all hands on deck!” Dr. Goldberg said to his staff. “Get the machines ready for an emergency extraction!”

“I think she needs something for this pain, Doc.” Freddy said. “This is the worst I’ve ever seen her.”

“No problem.” Dr. Goldberg whipped out a syringe and injected Lucy with a mind numbing tranquilizer. “This will take her away from Painsville and make her feel like she’s at Disney World.”

At the emergency room, Dr. Goldberg clamped two wires onto Lucy: one in the middle of her chest, the other on her forehead. The wires were connected to a car battery and a handheld switch. Dr. Goldberg handed the switch to Freddy and asked, “Would you like to do the honors?”

“Hell yeah!” Freddy wagged his tail, flipped the switch and howled up to the moon while shock waves surged through Lucy’s body! Lucy flapped her wings profusely, levitating three feet above the gurney while her entire body shook. “There she blows!” Quickly, Dr. Goldberg placed a nest below her as a nurse turned up the voltage.

“QUUUUAAACK!” A huge golden egg the size of a bowling ball came shooting out of Lucy; landing right into the nest. Lucy collapsed on the floor and twitched with the wires still attached to her.

“Wow, this is the biggest egg I’ve ever seen.” Dr. Goldberg said while his staff nursed Lucy’s wounds. “It’s a 200 pounder, at least.”

“Congratulations, Lue, you’re rich.” Freddy said with a smile. “Now maybe you could be my sugar momma.”

“That’s it! Next time I’m definitely calling an UBER.” Lucy said.

THE END.
