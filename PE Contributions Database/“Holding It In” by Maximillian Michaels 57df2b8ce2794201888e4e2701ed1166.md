**“Holding It In” by Maximillian Michaels**

****“How long did he say we had to stay in this hammock?” Said Isabel.

“He didn’t say exactly, just that it would be in our best interest *not to leave it*.” Said Carlos.

“We’ve been lying here for three hours no and this baby’s diaper is smelling pretty ripe. I think it was full when he handed the baby to us.” Said Isabel.

“I know, I was hoping it wasn’t you, but I didn’t want to be rude and say anything!” Said Carlos.

“Ha. Ha.” Said Isabel. “I’m getting ready to *need* a diaper if he doesn’t let us up soon. As a matter of fact, can you reach your hat?”

“Oh no!” Cried Carlos. “You are not using my hat to go to the bathroom in. No way!”

“Whose baby do you think this is? And why did he leave it with us?” Said Isabel.

“The man didn’t say, just that we better not move from this hammock, or else.” Said Carlos. “All I know is that he said the baby had made suspicious moves and for us to hang onto it while he went and put more ‘Trump for President’ signs in people’s yards.”

“Oh.” Said Isabel. “I do wish he would hurry up!”
