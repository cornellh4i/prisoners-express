**“Casual X Encounter” by Miguel Sheesh Lara**

Jack: Damn, bae that’s your Ex? She’s hot, when did that end and why?

Diane: Are you kidding me Jack, stop looking.

(*As she shoves him.)* You are making it weird. And no, never will I add a plus 1 to us. You are such an ass, face forward. (*Diane mumbles*) So much for trading up.

Jack: Excuse me, what was that last thing bae?

Diane: Nothing sweetie let’s keep shopping.

Julie: I’m so winning right now. I know he wants me, but does Diane still? So she’s into guys now, thought we were something serious? At least she saw me. That’s a win, what’s next, Starbucks or Ramen? IDK hopefully pass plane one more time before heading home.
