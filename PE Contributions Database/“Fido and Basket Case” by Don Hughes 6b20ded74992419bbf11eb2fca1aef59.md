**“Fido and Basket Case” by Don Hughes**

Fido: Hey - are you sure you know where the lake is?

BC: Yeah! - just keep pushing.

Fid: Man - you’re pushing me!

BC: I’m not pushing - you are!

Fid: You’re sure a pushy duck.

BC: What the duck are you talking about?

Fid: C’mon man - nevermind - where’s the lake?

BC: You sure this cart floats?

Fid: Yeah - saw the kids push it through a puddle the other day. It didn’t sink.

BC: Ok! Keep pushing.

Fid: Man - you’re pushing me!

BC: Geez - here we go again!

Fid: Dude, this trip is giving me the goosebumps.

BC: Watch it man!

Fid: Whaaa!

BC: I’m a geese.

Fid: What the duck are you talking about?

BC: My relatives are geese and we don’t have bumps.

Fid: You’re a quack! A basket case!

BC: I thought dogs were smart.

Fid: I’m not a dog. I’m a Fido!

BC: A what?

Fid: I’m a Fido. Look into my eyes and I will hypnotize you. Fido’s do that stuff.

BC: Read my lips - you’re nuts!

Fid: You don’t have lips.

BC: If I had wings I’d flap you silly.

Fid: Why no wings? What happened?

BC: I was born like this.

Fid: You gotta be a basket case. Ducks aren’t born!

BC: What the duck are you talking about?

Fid: Take a gander at that!

BC: What it dog…

Fid: I am - look behind me - we’re being tailed.

BC: I can’t see - is it a Park Ranger?

Fid: No - it’s that thing attached to my butt! - Hahahaha!!

BC: You’re nuts

Fid: Look up there!

BC: I’m not falling for that dude..

Fid: No - really - I think it’s an eagle!

BC: That’s not an eagle dummy - that’s a thunder cloud! Hear the thunder it’s making?

Fid: It’s gotta be an eagle. It has four wings. I heard it was a good year for eagles to come out.

BC: Nah! It’s a cloud. Too big for a bird.

Fid: C’mon man - clouds are in computers. I’m a Fido - I know this stuff.

BC: You’re doggone crazy!

Fid: Well - if it’s not an eagle it could be a huge duck. It’s white and floaty like you.

BC: I’m not a duck. It’s not a duck and you don’t know what the duck you’re talking about!

Fid: Ok! Ok! Ok! But look behind that tree we just passed!

BC: What is it this time!

Fid: I think it’s a native!

BC: A what?

Fid: A native!! You know - a pygmy girl with a blow gun.

BC: That’s a neighbor kid, dummy. What’s a blow gun?

Fid: It’s a stick you blow poison darts out of into someone.

BC: How does a blow gun sound?

Fid: It’s a sound to let you know you’re getting shot. Eerie.

BC: Sounds nice.

Fid: Little pygmy girl - look into my eyes and I will hypnotize you. Shoot the duck!!!BC: Duck!!! Incoming!! Hahahaha! You’re nuts -

Fid: You’re pushing me man!

BC: Don’t start! I’m getting hungry. Did you bring anything for our lunch at the lake?

Fid: No! I thought you packed it in your basket.

BC: I told you I was born this way.

Fid: Well, I didn’t get us anything to eat. Maybe we can eat those two carrots across the street?

BC: What’s a carrot?

Fid: It’s orange and looks like those over there. They’re good!!

BC: Looks like we’ll have to push real fast to catch them. Maybe you can get your pygmy girl to shoot them for us?

Fid: I don’t know. I think that bent over carrot just stuck its tongue out at us.

BC: I don’t think I want a carrot then. Looks like they just got out of jail.

Fid: Look! We must be getting close to the lake! That kid is playing in the water!

BC: That’s just the kid next door. She’s getting wet from a water hose because the lake is further away. Where’s the lake?

Fid: I asked you that 3 feet ago….!

BC: Hey! Watch out for that rock!!

Fid: What’s a rock?

BC: That thing stopping you from pushing me. I surely thought dogs were smart.

Fid: Well, I’ve been trying to get past that thing you call a rock. Why do you want to go to the lake anyway?

BC: Heard geese go there to swim.

Fid: You’re a basket case - you can’t swim. Besides, you’re a duck! A sitting duck!

BC: What the duck?

Fid: I think we’re being followed by our house!

BC: Why do you say that?

Fid: Look! It’s over there behind that tree in our front yard.

BC: Now we’ll never be able to tell how far the lake is.

Fid: Well, you hatched this idea.

BC: At least I got to see the other side of that tree over there.

Fid: I think I heard a can opener! We better get back before dinner time.

BC: Well, since the house followed us we don’t have far to go.

Fid: This was fun - maybe we can do this again tomorrow.

BC: Tell you what! - Why don’t you just hypnotize me and make me believe I had fun!?

Fid: Man - you’re a basket case!

BC: And you’re nuts! Keep pushing!

Fid: How do you turn this thing…?

Clifford: I’m sure glad I told that dog and basket duck the lake was the other way. Sure is peaceful and quiet here…
