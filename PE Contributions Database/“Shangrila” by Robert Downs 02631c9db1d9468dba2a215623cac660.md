**“Shangrila” by Robert Downs**

****I inhale crisp cool mountain air that’s redolent of pine trees, wildflowers, and a heavy dose of petrichor- both earthy and sweet- and as I stare at the beautiful cordillera disappearing into the clouded distance, I realize how lucky I am to have stumbled across this piece of forgotten territory. A slight breeze ripples the surface of the lake and agitates the clouds in one smooth stroke as I slip my fee into cool water.

I slip away to this Shangrila every chance I get. As long as I’m here I‘m free; I’m free of the politics, drama and mindless drones (my name for 98% of the guys in prison) that accompany “prison life.” While I’m walking along the shore of the lake, lounging on the pier, or exploring the mountains’ many defiles I can concentrate on the important things: mending my fractured soul, growing and becoming more, and rising from the dying embers of my Wasted Life a new man.

The water consumes me as I push off the pier and into the water. I can breathe somehow underwater; I don’t know how I knew this the first time I dove into the lake, I just did. It’s not the strangest thing I’ve experienced here in the realm of oblivion. I swim along the bottom to the deepest part of the lake, my scotopic irises- better than any flashlight-allow me to see everything clearly. I pass under a small school of striped bass, and then I’m here, my subaqueous lair. I grab and slide the steel grating off the jagged hole and swim in.

I enter a small antechamber of dark granite with quartz crystals scattered along the ceiling, a subdued light burning from within, dancing on the walls. I swim across the antechamber and down through an opening.

I walk out of the water and into a small cavern of black marble. Two steps out of the water and I’m completely dry. Large torches along the walls blaze to life, their flames bathe the polished cavern in a pleasant warmth. Flowing calligraphy incisided in the walls begin glowing an incarnacline hue that urges me forward into the center of the cavern. The calligraphy swirls and shifts along the walls as I get closer, almost like it was anticipating, like it was somehow eager.

Once I’m standing in the cavern’s nucleus an intaglio ring of the same flowing calligraphy encircles me, its blood-red light tainting my skin. I sit down and cross my legs and take a few slow deep breaths as my eyes slowly close, as I quickly find my center.

I focus on my breathing, to the air coming in and out of my nose. I breathe in and pause;I breathe out and pause. When a thought pulls my attention away I acknowledge it and respectfully push it away, always returning to my breath. I am at peace.

Everything slowly dissolves into nothingness as I fall deeper into my trance. This is where the work happens, where the prestidigitation takes place, the mending of my soul. It’s here that I’m able to begin the difficult task of gluing together the dismantled pieces of my existence.

“Chowtime! Chowtime!” A deep baritone pierces the nothingness, bringing with it the sounds of boots on concrete, the jingling of brass keys, and the unoiled squeak of the food cart rolling my way. I’m dragged kicking and screaming back into the realm of ignorance, oppression, bigoted thoughts and sadistic intent.

I slowly open my eyes, relishing the calmness I’m feeling before it's ripped from my white knuckled fist. It all comes surging back: the anxiety, depression, stress, the non-stop chattering of the Drones, and the assiduous oppression tactics of the guards. I let out a sigh as I leave the safety of my meditation mat (my folded blue blanket).

A wave of food parts being slammed open surges down the tier towards me, carrying with it a medley of salty processed “meat” and rubber vegetables. BAM! My trap opens and I grab the tray and cup of tea flavored water. I scarf my dinner without tasting it, drink the “tea” and rush to brush my teeth. I’m in a hurry to return to my lair, my private refuge. BAM! I slide the tray out and make a mad clash for my mat.

I sit down once again and cross my legs, my hands resting in my lap, my eyes closing and then it happens….
