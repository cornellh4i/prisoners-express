**“Survival of the Fittest” by Eric Langley**

It has amazed me, fascinated me really, that there is something about jail and prison that instantly de-evolves most of us. We walk through the solid steel door, and suddenly, things such as ethics and morality go out the window. We even step back in time to the days of segregation. What the actual fuck?

I’m reminded of when I was in county, fighting my case. I was complaining about someone being loud, and another inmate said to me, “This is jail!” I’ve done time in county before, and this wasn’t the first time I’d heard this retort. This time, however, I questioned, “Okay? So what does that mean? Respect and common courtesy are dissolved?” My counterpart paused and responded, “I don’t know. That’s just what I’ve always heard.” We were both about the same age with similar backgrounds and talked in length about this attitude that seems common place.

Then there is the guy who decides he is the President of the television because “can’t nobody in here whoop me!” We are all familiar with situations like these. It is something that I doubt will ever change. Yet, I still wonder why.

The only theory I have is the combination of two things. There aren’t any wives, mothers, aunts, or grannies around to get on our case for being ignorant. Similarly, there is a lack of authority figures like police around to keep the peace.

Truly, this disturbs my hope for humanity that this de-evolution is so defined and so easily accepted. How about thinking next time, “Would I act like this if my mom was here?”

The final part of this equation is what is it that sends us back in time? Spitting in the faces of Lincoln, M.L.K. Jr., Rosa Parks, et al. Racism and segregation are on a level that civilized lie hasn’t seen for decades. Even Steven Tyler who is far from a philosopher can sing, “If you can judge a wiseman by the color his skin, then Mister, you’re a better man than I.” Yet on the yard, this concept eludes us. Why?
