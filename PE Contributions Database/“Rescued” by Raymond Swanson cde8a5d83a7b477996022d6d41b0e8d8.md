**“Rescued” by Raymond Swanson**

It was merely 5:00 AM when the pager beeped me out of my sleep. My new girlfriend jolted awake on the floor beside me. As would become the routine, I kissed her and header into the darkness to help someone in need.

“Motor Vehicle Accident” was all the information the dispatcher was able to give us. As was the case on many occasions, we were going into the unknown.

Dawn was peeking on the distant horizon when I got to the fire station in time to catch the 1993 Freightliner Pumper with the Chief driving. The help had seemingly “came out of the woodwork” on this very early morning.

The earliest units on scene decided to med-evac the patient to a hospital more equipped than that of our nearest small town. The nearest helicopter base was approximately 75-85 miles away by road, yet a mere 25 minutes by air. They’d be with us in a rather timely manner.

The Chief and I were on scene only minutes before we set out to set up the “LZ” (landing zone). Based on the time of day and its proximity to the scene, we decided on a field behind a remodeled farm house.

Half hour after daybreak, with the sun poking through the treetops, the echoes took over and soon the rotor wash was kicking up dust and leaves, knocking the tallest grass to the soil. The stretcher emerged from the ambulance, and three others and myself took over to deliver the patient to the flight medic.

After handing over the precious cargo we stood back, watching as “the bird” lifted off and soon disappeared behind the trees. In this moment, in a head full of young thoughts, I couldn’t help but feel relieved this man had been rescued.
