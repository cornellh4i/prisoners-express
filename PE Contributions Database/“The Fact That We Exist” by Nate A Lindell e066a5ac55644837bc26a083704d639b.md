**“The Fact That We Exist” by Nate A. Lindell**

A notion came to me as I finished re-reading Lawrence M. Krauss’s A Universe From Nothing, which should help those of you who’ve dared to study his theoretical cosmology. Pg, 170 states, as a conclusion (earlier parts explain why) “quantum gravity not only appears to allow universes to be created from nothing… it may require them. [Because] ‘Nothing’... is unstable.”

Recall in my piece, “Infinite Thoughts,” I described some of the implications of infinity in different realms (e.g. mathematics, time, space). It’s within the realm of infinite nothing - “no space, no time, no anything!” - that Dr. Krauss is right!

You have to grasp the concept of infinite nothing to begin to realize what Dr. Krauss + I are saying. True nothing is, by definition, infinite; it’s an absolute, without even the “matrix” of space/time (outer space) that most people wrongly envision when “nothing” is spoke of; true nothing is an absence of anything, even time. And within the non-limit of eternal time the **“quantum fluctuations”** that are an inherent feature of nothing will occasionally produce little bangs, Big Bangs and all the matter + energy that exists in universes like ours (Dr. Krauss explains this process, which is beneath the scope of this essay).

The concept of **“relativity”** comes into play though to add more branches of thought to Dr. Krauss’s theory, which seems to have escaped his attention. Pgs. 168-169 of his book say that the lifetimes of the “tiny” U’s created by quantum fluctuations will be “microscopic” - but that depends on who’s holding the microscope! (Recall Horton Hears a Who by Dr. Seuss.) From our perspective, with the laws of physics unique to our U, U’s that bubble up in quantum nothingness’s infinity may “appear” short spanned (and we’d have no way to measure them anyway) to us; but this may be due solely to our perspective, given the laws of physics unique to our U’. Time, for example, may be “faster” in other U’s, so that a trillion years passes for them in what seems a femtosecond in ours. Within infinity (i.e. infinite U’s produced within the infinite nothingness of the macroverse) this is not only possible but must happen, at least once, or infinite nothingness is not truly infinite!

This is relevant to us because we too may live in such a U, where time seems “slow” or normal to us (everything seems normal to those experiencing it, even the lives many of us lived that we didn’t realize were Abby-normal until we observed “normal” people’s lives), yet the lifetime of our U’ is so short that it’s not even measurable within the timescale of another U’.

We may be “nothing” in the minds of sentient beings in other U’s “out there”; yet we sure deem ourselves to be important… to ourselves, from our own myopic perspective, when it’s a close call, a freak chance that our U’ even burped up in quantum infinity and burped in such a way that the formation of matter and life was even possible.

None of this is meant to say we or our U’ are irrelevant, but to suggest that us “Whos,” like Horton’s Whos, make the most of our temporal existence, to give our lives meaning, to make our U’ closer to a heaven than the hell that too many struggle to make our lives.
