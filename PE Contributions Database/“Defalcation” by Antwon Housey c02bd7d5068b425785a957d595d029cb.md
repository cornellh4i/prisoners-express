**“Defalcation” by Antwon Housey**

When does one encounter that defining moment within life? As I stand in the booth conducting this locomotive, I realize that my life isn’t as amazing as I once believed. Throughout my career, I’ve seen many places. Yet still I lack the experience of being in these many places. Only witnessing them in passing. Never speaking with their Natives. Conducting this locomotive has blessed me with so much blurred scenery that it's difficult for me to distinguish. I chose this job for the benefits of travel. Now I loathe this career because it reminds me of the subtle restrictions that I’ve placed upon myself. Places that I witness in passing will always remain a blur to me, if I continue to stand in this booth conducting this same locomotive.
