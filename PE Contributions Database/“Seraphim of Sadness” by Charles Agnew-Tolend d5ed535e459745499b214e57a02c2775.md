**“Seraphim of Sadness” by Charles Agnew-Tolend**

Once upon a time, I dreamed that I could fly away from all my demons and problems.

But now I sit inside this glass box with my wings cut and gone.

If only you could see the sadness in my eyes, because the gods have left me here, on Earth, paralyzed.
