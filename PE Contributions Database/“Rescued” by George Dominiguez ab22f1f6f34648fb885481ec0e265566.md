**“Rescued” by George Dominiguez**

I know I’ve been rescued so many times in my life. Just when I was about 3 months old. I was in the hospital, and almost died from pneumonia. My mom told me I was covered in wires, needles, and tubes. My father couldn’t stand to see me like that. At 4 years old I was stung by wasps. My parents had to rush me to the hospital. At age 7 my friend’s dog attacked me, and as I was running I was almost hit by a bus. At 11 I was riding my bike, and I didn’t see the hole in the street. I flew over the handlebars, and broke my right collar bone. Still hurts sometimes. At 12 I got shot at for breaking into cars. I didn’t get hit. At 19, my girlfriend’s cousins and their friends came to gang up on me, and my friend left me alone, for dead with them. At 20 I was drinking when some guys with guns came in and robbed us. At 25 I was sent to prison, and then again at 36. I look back now, and have come to the realization that it was solely through the grace of God that I was rescued. I may never understand it, but I have truly been rescued. Sadly, I have HIV, but again, with God’s grace, I feel well, and healthy. God is my rescuer, my lifesaver.
