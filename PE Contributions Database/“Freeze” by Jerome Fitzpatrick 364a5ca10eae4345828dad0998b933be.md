**“Freeze” by Jerome Fitzpatrick**

****It was a chilly and breezy fall day. The flowing sun was shining beautifully, but it wasn’t producing enough heat to warm the chills on my skin. The puffy white clouds sailed across the ocean blue sky. I laughed as I watched the clouds form an animation of a dragon about to eat Mickey Mouse. Feeling a vibration in my pocket, I checked the incoming text. Not wanting to deal with baby momma drama, I dismissed the text with a “Whatever!” 5:35 p.m. displayed on my phone, and I wanted to be back from the neighborhood convenience store before the evening finally sets in.

I darted into the house to retrieve my favorite black and blue hoodie, but I was cornered off before I could make it out the front door. “Where are you going?” She asked concernedly, but with that you-didn’t-ask-me-first attitude.

“Mom, I’m a grown man with a son, a job, and my own place.” I responded.

“I don’t care. You can be a old man with nothing, and you will still be my baby. So where are you going?”

I knew I couldn’t win so I forfeited. “I’m walking to the store to buy some lotto tickets. I’m feeling lucky today.”

“Okay, Mr. Lucky Charm. Be sure you come right back because you’re not escaping eating dinner with your mother this evening,” she said demandingly. My mother loves it when I come visit her. After kissing me on the cheek, she hugged me, “I love you.”

“I love you too!” I replied, embracing her back. I walked outside and stood on the front porch thinking how some things in life never change. I remember her saying to me, “Baby, you’ll never know when the day one of us will never come back home. And I don’t want you to ever forget how much I love you.”

Walking to the convenient store was something my mother would let me do when I was a kid. I just had to be within yelling distance--when my mother had to call my name to come in the house--before the streetlights came on. My mother lives in a low income residential area with a Section 8 housing project six blocks away. So it wasn’t a surprise to hear gunshots or to see thugs, drugs, dealers, or hoodrats walking the streets. But the part of the neighborhood my mother lived in was rich with love because the good that abodes in the people’s hearts. The people were always friendly, and they would sit on their front porch and speak or wave at almost everybody who will walk or drive by. But for some reason, something bad would happen that would break these good, well-respected, God fearing people’s hearts. I remember how I liked to go around the neighborhood doing chores to make money so I could go to the store to buy what I wanted. I was excited to bring back some Hershey Kisses and a strawberry Fanta to the girl I had a crush on. That was my young player image to the other kids on the block, but I faced a fear to actually receive a kiss from her. I called myself a hustler, but my mother didn’t approve of me using that word: “You work for your money, not hustle.” A couple of times she thought I was selling or running drugs, but I didn’t ever take that chance. My older brother had a reputation that most of the teenagers feared, and I feared what he would do to me if he caught me selling drugs. However, the people in the neighborhood loved him because he always helped the elderly in some generous way. He didn’t like accepting money for his generosity, but if it was forced on him, he will give the money to me so I could go to the store. It was our secret. It was still amazing to walk through the neighborhood seeing the kids playing and the people who had grown older in this chaotic world sit on their porch waving at me, but being faithful church goers and believers, they were at peace with their lives.

As the evening grew closer, the air became colder. I put my hood on and shoved my hands inside my hoodie’s pockets. Out of nowhere, a patrol car drove past me but suddenly stopped. The police officer ejected out of the patrol car with his gun pointing directly at me, “Freeze!” I immediately stopped but looked around to see if I was the target that the officer was aiming at. I heard a report to the dispatcher that he had the suspect at gunpoint. *But what am I suspect of? A young black man in a hoodie?* “You in the black and blue hoodie, slowly put your hands over your head,” he ordered demandingly. I panicked as I pulled my hands out of my pockets with my phone in my right hand. Suddenly, I fell to the ground after hearing what I thought sounded like large firecrackers. I felt this burn going through my body and my clothes were starting to get soaked with this thick liquid substance. I couldn’t move anymore, and I was in excruciating pain. I heard the screams, “Oh my god!” echoing in my head before my conscience began to talk to me. Is this what it’s like to face fear? Is this the day my mother told me about? The text from my baby’s momma. Who’s going to play video games with my son? What about my brother? Who’s going to tell my mother that I’m not coming home? Her kisses. Her hugs. Her I love yous. God forgive me. I exhaled my last breath. In reality, I woke up from this dream. Or did I?
