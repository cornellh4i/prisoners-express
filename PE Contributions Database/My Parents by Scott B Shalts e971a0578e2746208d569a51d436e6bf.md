**My Parents By Scott B Shalts**

DNA is what makes all things on earth what we are. It is the biological (biochemical) code that controls the pre programmable development of the different species. We are the human platforms existing in the earthbound program that makes up our reality in our particular universe. The universe and all it is and all it contains and continues to expand into is what our brains and minds are capable of preserving so what are parents?

Parents pass on particular strings of genes that bring us into existence when these genes are combined. Our parents carry our biological computer codes around with them until it is time for “us” to come into existence just like someone carries around codes for any number of technological advances in his/her head. Really.

Is there some greater role they play or purpose they fulfill? Who knows.

Evolution always tries to make us better. Even when we humans do our best to thwart it and get in its way. The purpose of life is the advancement of life. The progress of life, like technology, to a higher order of being.

The past is only relevant in solar as it allows us to make adjustments in the now so that we can out do the things that have held us back. The now is the perpetual state of being that we forever try to make better by inventing new ways of existing in tomorrow-the future.

All parents get us to this here. We exist in our now. We all have a purpose in this program. Our purposes are to make it a better place. A more progressive and advanced place.

My parents, I thank you for getting me here. I will do my best.
