**“Unchanging” by Charles Murphy**

****Here is a mountain. When we think of mountains, we conjure the images of a solid, massive form of earth that doesn’t move or change and probably hasn’t since humans first walked the earth.

However, these thoughts are misleading. Mountains do, in fact, change as well as move, except observing these things is nearly impossible. To see changes takes time.

To the outside world, I am like this mountain. To the correction department especially, I seem to be the same selfish criminal who hasn’t learned a thing from being locked up, but that isn’t the case.

With time, most mountains rise taller and taller, high above the rest. Mount Everest grows a few centimeters a year. This growth can’t be witnessed by casual glance, but it is happening even as you read this.

I look at the mirror and see the same guy I’ve always been, maybe a new scar or laugh line, just like a mountain gets sculpted by erosion. Inside myself is much different from the outside, like the magma influencing the growth of this mountain. My thoughts are changing, shifting in my mind, forming new ways of thinking, and melting away the negativity of my heart. You might not see this process, but the D.O.C. might say it’s made up. That doesn’t matter because I am changing: I will rise and reach the fullest extent of my potential.

With time, all things are possible. Even mountains change.
