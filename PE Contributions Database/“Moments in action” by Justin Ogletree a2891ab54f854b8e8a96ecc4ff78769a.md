**“Moments in action” by Justin Ogletree**

Hot summers and cool breezes

Clockwise situations and patience

When your life is in danger??

Long islands with short timing

While coconuts float on alcohol beverages

Rainy days will take the edge away

As pineapples sizzle on baked ham days

Turning pages are amazing

When clocks tick tock and no bodies ringing

Shadows are sliding while the sun is rising

Climbing higher than the mileage

Of a car high beam

With bricks stacked tall cinder blocks don’t fall

Voly in the day birds chirp in the mall…
