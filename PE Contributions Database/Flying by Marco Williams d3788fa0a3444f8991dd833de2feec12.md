**Flying by Marco Williams**

One of my greatest joys in life is flying. I was always fascinated with flying. I have been flying since I was 12 and let me tell you, my first experience was awesome. Yet, I did not board the People’s Express DC-10 with trepidation.

I’ve always been an adventurer. Being born and raised in Detroit and having an unhealthy fascination for electronics, I adventured a lot. I was always finding ways inside of abandoned homes, warehouses and department stores just to find a few electronics.

So when I boarded the airplane, the first thing I’d asked for was to see the cockpit. I was told by the boarding stewardess that I would get the chance once we were airborne. I was so excited. I was treated like a kid, but also like an adult because I was flying alone. So the stewardesses all fawned over me, to my delight.

After takeoff, a really pretty white lady came to get me to go and see the cockpit. (Now being from the center of the west side of Detroit in the 70s, white folks were non-existent. All of my public school teachers were black except my 4th grade science teacher and my 7th grade history teacher.) So being escorted to the front of the plane by this beautiful white lady holding my hand made me feel very special indeed and I was beaming all the way to the cockpit.

When I arrived in the cockpit, I was so stunned by all of the lights and the myriad of switches, gauges, levers and buttons, that my feet could not move. My breath was stuck in my throat and my mind was in turmoil. A part of me was looking out of the window and seeing only sky. And the adventurer in me was studying all of the wonderful electronics and wanting to touch everything.

Everyone, both pilots and the stewardess, were smiling and trying to talk to me. I looked at them and thought they were speaking Glosolaglia. I could not understand a word they were uttering. And when I said “what?!?!”, they all broke into fits of laughter which, in turn, made me laugh. Then the copilot asked me if I wanted to be a pilot and I replied, “No”. They all looked shocked. Then I said, “I just want to know how to fix this thing if it breaks or make it better.” The copilot then unbuckled his harness and proceeded to tell me what ALL of the lights, buttons, gauges and switches were used for.

I had a good time on my first flight, and ever since, I choose to fly wherever I go. I’ve been on 42 aircrafts in 12 years, 3 of which were helicopters during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. I went on one of the last concords to Hong Kong. Two fighter jets, and one propeller plane which scared the hell out of me.

I have dreams of flying while not using any form of mechanical device. It’s more like Neo on “The Matrix” or Superman. However, I love flying! Being in the air and looking down on city lights at night or the vast landscape of clouds below the plane.

Some may become enthralled in the wonder of how tons of metal can stay aloft. Yet, I study physics and have had a natural affinity for engineering since I was a child and could easily explain how an airplane can fly or how flight by any machine is possible.

No, for me, it is the freedom. And on a brief note: The first time I actually jumped out of an airplane…

I look out of the open door. I approach with a little trepidation. I hear only wind and see only sky. The craft is buffeted by powerful turbulence. Then I step forward and jump into the void, right out of the airplane by myself for the first time. With the 4 tandem jumps previously, it felt nothing like this. This was better than sex. The freedom. The speed. The near-nothingness but wind. The freedom of movement. The ecstasy.

I was flying.
