**“Holding Her Tenderly in My Heart” by Bryan Noonan**

“This is it!” my wife tells me over the phone. “We’ve got to get to the hospital now. My contractions are back, and something is *not* right.” I jump into my car and head straight for home. Fortunately, we only live a few miles away.

It’s been a long few months as my wife has been on bedrest due to premature labor. She’s been in the hospital several times already, and at one point we thought we lost the baby. We’ve been fortunate so far, but it’s been a stressful few months. It’s still early, but the doctor says the baby can survive at this point. We drive as fast as we safely can to the hospital 30 minutes away. They are expecting us and get her right in.

At the hospital, the doctor gives my wife a steroid shot to help the baby’s lungs develop more. An ultrasound shows that the baby is fine, but my wife is leaking amniotic fluid. The doctor is worried. He tells us that he’s going to have to perform an emergency C-section first thing in the morning, but he wants to give the baby’s lungs as much time as possible to develop. It’s a long night as the doctors and nurses closely monitor both my wife and our baby.

Early the next morning, the doctor (or doctors) and nurses surround my wife’s bed. “Are you ready?” the doctor queries. “We’ve gotta get you in pretty quick here. Dad, are you good with being in there with your wife?” I nod my head quickly. I wouldn’t miss this for anything. I’ve had some emergency medical training, so the thought of blood doesn’t bother me, but if I’m honest, I’m pretty worried for my wife and the baby’s safety.

After my wife is wheeled into the room and prepped, I’m brought in. The nurse has already placed a stool by my wife’s head so I can provide her emotional support through the birth. I can’t see the doctor cutting into my wife’s belly from where I’m sitting, which is just as well. I whisper comforting words to my wife as the doctors and nurses do their thing. Within what seemed a very short couple of minutes, the doctor asks me, “Dad, you want to see your daughter enter this world?” I stand up and watch the doctor pull my daughter’s tiny body from my wife’s belly. Quickly, the nurse whisks her to another station to clean her up and take her APGAR scores. She struggles to breathe at first, but otherwise all seems fine.

“Come on over here, dad. You want to hold your beautiful daughter?” Tears jump to my eyes as I gently cradle her in my arms. She’s so tiny! Her body fits into the palm of my hand. Her hands and feet are the size of my thumbs. Too quickly, the nurse takes my daughter and brings her to my wife. She kisses her and cries over how beautiful she is, but soon our baby is whisked away again to the neonatal unit. Born two months early, she only weighs 3lbs. 15oz., and she’s still struggling to breath on her own.

After spending several weeks in the hospital, my daughter is finally released to come home with us. She’s on a breathing monitor because she still struggles to breathe on her own, but otherwise she’s doing great. The next several exhausting months fly by, and my daughter makes astonishing progress in growth. Months have now turned into years and my daughter is no longer a tiny baby. Those tiny feet are no longer piddle paddling all over the house. They no longer follow me everywhere or stand on my feet as we dance together. Today, she’s a remarkable and intelligent young woman. She’s an accomplished senior in high school and she’s taller than most girls her age. I’d give anything to hold her tiny little hands in mine again, to cradle her tiny feet in the palm of my hand. Instead, I hold all of her tenderly in my heart.
