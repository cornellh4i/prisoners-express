**“Picture” by Tamara Angelique Allenbaugh**

Happy feet! Little tiny happy baby feet! Is there anything more refreshing than a newborn baby? Think about it—the circle of life continues with each new baby that enters in the world. When I think of the women out there, who are irresponsible and have unprotected, illicit sex and think it’s okay to just get an abortion to elimninate the results of irresponsibility, it depresses me. You see, I’m on the fence when it comes to the abortion issue. Do I believe that abortion is warrented and justified in some cases? Absolutely. But every pregnant woman = a potential life, and it saddens me to know how many lives are forfeited just because that life may be inconvenient. I will stand by my beliefs, and will mourn every single loss of potential life without just cause.
