For most of us, when we are born, our parents bless or curse us by the name they bestow upon us. For better or worse, that is the name we carry for the rest of our lives. However, our birth name is not the only name we will be known by. Very few people go through life without picking up at least one nickname. Most of us receive, use, and discard several over the course of our lifetimes.

Nicknames are as diverse, descriptive, complementary, and disparaging as there are human beings. Nicknames may be hung on people for any number of reasons and in many societies or organizations it is considered a rite of passage to receive one. For most of us the choice of nickname will not be left up to us, but made by others. The only way to get rid of an undesirable nickname is to acquire another one, which may not be a good thing. Ultimately it is up to us to accept, grow into, and be identified by our nickname. Not that we have any real choice in the matter.

How is it that we acquire a nickname, which the dictionary calls an informal descriptive name added to or replacing the actual name of a person, place, or thing? Your own family, the very ones to name you in the first place, are usually the first ones to have a nickname on you, calling you Mikey, Shelly, Bud, or Sis. Then you leave home and run into Pee Pants and Cry Baby, while they call you Cookie Monster. When we go to school and enter into our adolescent rites of passage we are met by Butch, Spike, and that pretty red-haired girl named Babe, while they all remember you as Geek or Psycho. It is during these formulative years that we enter into clubs, scouts, or sports and the nicknames fly fast and loose. Whitey, Leftie, TayTay, Hot Lips, and those girls with unfortunate names become BJ’s.

Then we leave the womb of school and enter into the cold, cruel world of work, be it blue collar, white collar, or camouflage, where nicknames become more descriptive and derogatory. We’ve all known or heard of a Fast Frank, Slo-Moe, Betty Bonkers or a Sleazy Sal. The military if rife with job nicknames, such as Doe, Sparky, Gunner, Top, or Florence Nightingale. It is here that many lifetime nicknames are bestowed, such as General Schwartzkoff being named Bear at West Point, a nickname he wore long before he became world-renowned as Stormin’ Norman. Movie stars and sports stars such as The Duke and Hammerin’ Hank will live forever in our hearts.

Prison walls hold many nicknames inside. There are Paperhangers, Macks, Chesters, Firebugs, and Five-Fingered Discounters. In one twenty-four man dorm there is a Zulu, Fireball, Choppa, Doc, JoJo, BoBo, Ace, Lakewood, Jax, Chip, Domino, Florida Boy, TC, and Johnny Cochrane. You have cons, inmates, and snitches. Then there are the Screws, Turnkeys, and Cops Wearing Stripes to denote those in charge or trying to curry favor with the cops with real badges.

A person’s sexual desirability or orientation brings forth a plethora of nicknames. One women was known as .44 Magnum for her magnificent bosom she wouldn’t hesitate to display. Then there are the Meats, PeeWees, and Luscious Lulus, while gay men are called Nancys and a lesbian is known as a Dyke. As can be seen, nicknames can be funny, delightful, or cruel.

As I teen I was once called Wet Willie after I went swimming in a Minnesota lake to retrieve a duck a friend had shot down. Later in life I was dubbed Orca, because I was the biggest man on the team and carried the M-60 machine gun. Nowadays I am known variously as Truck, Poppa, Dad, Unc, Sardo, LT, or The Candyman. My girlfriend calls me her Knight in Dented Armor.

Look around and identify everyone you see by their nickname. Isn’t it amazing how many people we know only by their nickname? And what nickname is it you live up to?
