**Almost by Shannon Richardson**

I was almost born to parents

Who would love me and treat me right.

But some other baby beat me to it

And I got parents who liked to fight.

My “mother” didn’t want me-

she didn’t want to share my daddy with me.

Daddy didn’t agree with giving me away-

that ended with a divorce decree.

I almost had a happy childhood

despite my rocky start,

but with daily alcoholic beatings,

it tore my world apart.

I almost had a good marriage

And a happy - ever - after life.

But I was stubborn, immature, and vengeful,

And I stopped being a good wife.

I almost was the happiest woman alive

Giving birth to the six loves of my life to call my own,

But I made a series of bad choices

And ended up in prison all alone.

Life is full of choices -

Be careful what you choose.

In this wonderful game of life,

Make the wrong choice and you lose.
