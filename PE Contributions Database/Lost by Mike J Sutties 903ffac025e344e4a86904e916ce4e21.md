**by Mike J. Sutties**

Starting at about 15, I started to get lost and failed to realize exactly how long this would last. I had no authority figures in my life and no consequences to what I did. My life started to spiral out of control, and I began to feel completely lost. I began getting caught for weed, pills, and crack which brought me into the courts for the first time as an adult.

At this time I felt untouchable and unlovable and failed to realize where I was ending up. I moved to place after place and never felt safe. I lost all my family and most of my friends. I became addicted to drugs and females and continued to feel lost.

Now about this time there was a female who I was dating. She and I started using heroin. For the first time in years I felt full, alive and in love. I was in love with this girl and with this drug.

This drug gave me everything I wanted. With this drug I was no longer lost but found. I continued to inject heroin for four or five years before I hit rock bottom. I did anything and everything I could for heroin. I went to prison time after time for this drug.

My life dramatically changed for me about two years ago. One day I got that phone call no one wants to get. I received a call saying my mother is dying and has three days left. They say cancer stage four. So I’m loosing my best friend and mom.

Ten days go by and I get another dreadful experience. My brother died from a heart attack. At this time I have never felt more lost in my entire life.

Talk about feelings I never knew. At this same time I got diagnosed with Hep C and scarring of my liver. Right now I feel alone scared, and incomplete.

Although as of today, 138 days from the door, so I feel lost? Not anymore but I’m still not complete. I’m afraid of what can happen after prison, although I’ve got to know myself, things I like to do and things I want out of life.

As of today, I’m complete, no longer lost, and encouraged and ready to stay found and move forward. This is my story on lost. I hope you enjoyed it and it made sense.
