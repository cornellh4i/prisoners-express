**Paved Road by Gerald Durst**

The paved road was cracked from years of exposure to the elements. The broken white stripes, indicators that passing slower vehicles was okay on this stretch of road, vanish into the long distance of the skyward reaching mountains.

Wispy clouds made a beautiful backdrop, a white and fluffy like cotton balls, to the sharp, knife edged, jagged peaks. A sliver of moon hanging in the sky like a thumb nail.

There is a dusting of snow upon the higher peaks, leftovers from the summer melt, but fall is coming on. Soon snow will begin to fall and cover those majestic tops once more. I should be past those mountains before then.

Thankfully I was able to get out of California after the world went to hell. Ever since the power grids were deliberately shut down by E.M.P.S, working vehicles are very rare. Yep, the power that launched nukes at every nation on earth, enough to E.M.P. entire nations, to shut down all infrastructure everywhere (I don’t know what they were thinking), plunged the world into a new dark age.

People everywhere began to take out the grudges upon their neighbors. There was race war, family feuds, patracide, matricide, rape, theft, and on and on. I was an intended target myself.

My neighbor in my apartment complex had some sort of grudge against me. I don’t know what it was. Maybe he was angry that I had a real good tech job. I was, am, a nerd. Card carrying member of the Geek Squad.

Maybe he hated the fact that I was a nerd. That I had friends over on the weekends for three days of gaming and hanging out.

Maybe he hated the fact that I was considered, by others, a good looking and likable guy. I always had ladies over every day of the week. Some even played in our games on the weekend. Needless to say, I never went without.

Maybe he was just jealous of my happy, carefree life. Whatever it was he hated about me caused him to bust into my apartment with a butcher knife.

That was stupid. Never bring a knife to a gun fight. Did I mention that I own guns? Yep. I am also a history buff.

When he kicked the door in, I was wearing my Colt .45 1911A1 on my right hip. He didn’t even pause. He came in screaming with that knife held high above his head, and the light glinting off it like he had taken time to polish it first. All I did was draw and shoot.

Double tap.

Two rounds to his sternum. I know I shredded his heart. I also know that with law and order broken down in the big cities it was time to leave.

I grabbed up my A.L.I.C.E. pack with its aluminum frame, packed it with a few changes of clothes and some cold weather stuff, food, and ammo. I also stuffed some canned goods into my socks and tied these to the frame of the pack. An old Vietnam era trick.

I had canteens attached to loops on the pack, and two more on my pistol belt along with the aforementioned .45, a machete, and a big Bowie knife. I also had several clip pouches for the .45 and the M1 Carbine I had slung over my shoulder.

I hit the road.

Now, here I am days later, alone, trudging toward the pass in those distant mountains that this lonely road leads to.

I have no idea what has become of my friends or my lady loves. I left. I took no time to look anyone up. Does this make me cold hearted and selfish? Or does it make me smart and survivalistic?

Personally, I feel smart. A little lonely. I miss having friends around. I miss waking up to a pretty, sleeping face, and the warmth of a female body lying next to mine. I miss cold beer.

What I don’t miss is all the politics and BS of the old world. Old World, wow! Only days ago it was the Whole World. Now its the Old World, and I’m trapped in this New World of survival. A world of kill or be killed.

I’ve killed.

If it’s my life or theirs, I’ll kill again. I’ll help whom I can. I take down the bullies and the despots, and the petty little king wannabes. I’ll help the helpless, and the downtrodden. I’ll kiss the girl…

Okay, let's be honest… I’ll do a lot more than just kiss her. But, if she says “No”, I’ll just pack up and leave. We need to have some civility and No means No.

Always has, always will.
