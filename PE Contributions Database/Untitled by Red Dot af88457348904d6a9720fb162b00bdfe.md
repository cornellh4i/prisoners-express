**by Red Dot**

Red Dot and his friends decided to spend time at the beach, grilling, drinking beer, and smoking some. This area of the beach is Indian Territory, and there’s a statue of a warrior chief by the parking lot.

They all hop into the truck filled with food, drinks, radio, blanket, and grill. They plan to stay the whole day, and when they got there, the sun was beaming--90 degrees. I tossed a friend a Budweiser, and when we started smoking, the Indian chief started walking out from the water. Red Dot said, “You see that? Look man!” “What, you messed up my high… What’s that?” “That’s the hydro hold up. This can’t be real.”

He’s walking right toward us with his clothes dry and his hands up, chanting. When Red Dot looked to the parking lot, he noticed the statue wasn’t there anymore. “This ain’t weed.” The indian walked up to cooler then grabbed a Budweiser. He drank it slowly and started dancing, “This beer tastes good. Thank you. Who’s that singing?” “That’s RiRi.” “OK. I got to go back to my statue now. Enjoy yourself.”
