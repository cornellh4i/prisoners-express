**Animals in Mountains by Jeremy Brown**

“Now I know what drove Van Gogh. Da Vinvi, and Michelangelo, and Poe mad” - spoke the man

“Can you hurry up and take that picture? It’s too damn cold out. I mean we’re in the Sierra Nevadas for Christ’s sake, and you have over a hundred pounds of weight on me, I mean by god can’t I just lie down yet, this is nuts. I’ve got icicles growing on my teats and now I’ve started a new hairstyle - ice dreads. Well how do I look? I know I look prehistoric, but at least I have horns. Come over here so I can poke you in the ribs. But I can’t, you’re my human and I love you. I mean we’ve been out here for like 6 years. You and your solo quest of staying off the grid, when are you going back to your crazed human Ant Hill? Ah, but I know you. You’ve been in prison for 75 years, now that they let you out, you won’t ever go back there, will you? I knew it, you can’t keep away from me.” Tug Tug Tug. “Let’s go through the mountains again, no problem, Yank these ice dreads off my ass will you, it’s cold back there. Well at least you can cuddle in real close to me tonight cause it’ll be a cold one. Our close warmth will help us both survive. I promise I won’t roll on you like last time. I really broke your left knee that time, didn’t I, ha ha, good good times! Give me some whisky will you, this wildebeest needs a warm drink. Good for the blood flow you know.”

“Fine, quit pestering me, you’re the most talkative beast I’ve ever met. Do you want me to sew your mouth closed?”

The wildebeest made no response. The man being away from society and civilization for so long couldn’t tell what was real or fantasy, and his past prison bid only made it worse. “Damn, got to stop drinking.” He then chucked the absinthe into the snow.

“Now Jeremy, why did you go and do that?”spoke the wildebeest.

“Holy smokes, I guess my fantasies were real after all, and you’re a real talking wildebeest. By God, I thought I was going mad.” A tear rolled down the man’s cheek as he came to the realization that his fantasies were actually manifesting before his eyes into reality. The line between fact and fiction became one.

“Now I know what drove Van Gogh. Da Vinvi, and Michelangelo, and Poe mad after drinking absinthe it opened their minds, which in turn manifested all their fantasies into an actual reality.”

“I was never a fiction, Jeremy. I was always able to speak, it’s just that other human minds weren’t open to hear me speak, because they were always on their phones, and well I could only speak softly” he wildebeest said.

After this enlightening realization the man went to the back of the wildebeest and pulled off the ice dreads that accumulated on its buttocks. “Well now that I’ve attained Animal Communication Enlightenment, I guess the only thing left to do is to pull ice dreads off your ass.”

“What a paradox after all.” That night they both got drunk on absinthe in a cave with a hot fire away from the Human ANt Hills and complete Insanity.
