**“Spring Fever” by Dillon Gresham** 

Flowers grow. Trees blossom. It’s still chilly weather, but the air warms up. Butterflies fly around. Time moves forward. Animals come out. The land returns to its most beautiful shape. March 20th until June 20th/ Kids hunting Easter eggs. People celebrating Passover. The National Day of Prayer. Mother’s Day. Armed Forces Day. Memorial Day. Flag Day. Father’s Day. Springtime is a new beginning for everything.
