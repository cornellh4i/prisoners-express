**“Emerging from the Fog” by Efren Hawkins**

****It took me forty-three years to start getting to know myself. The idea came the day when I truly admitted to myself that I didn’t know how to be a father. I hope my kids can one day forgive me, but their lives were better off without me.

For years I just enjoyed life, mostly day by day, because I didn’t see a future for myself. Then, I started to gain knowledge on a number of different things. As I did research, I would see vivid pictures of some past moments in my life. There was much that I had forgotten as well as a number of things I wanted to forget. All this and so many other things woke up my consciousness. Now the internal me also sees the good side of me that I never noticed. I’m gonna make it simple. I am truly a better person than I thought I was.

I give more respect than the people around me do. I credit my mom with that, because she taught me to always have respect for those that deserve it and have earned it. If you give it, you’ll also receive it. Self-knowledge will help each of us make it through the fog. We must find the greatness in ourselves before we place others’ greatness before our own, because each and every one of us has a purpose in the eye of the one that created everything.

Our ability to reflect is what’s a true blessing to us, because it raises us up so much. Still, we appreciate it so little. Let’s look inside ourselves and give “thanks” for the life we have lived, because it could have been a lot harder or much worse. Let’s get off our knees and stand up and emerge from the fog of life with our heads held high.
