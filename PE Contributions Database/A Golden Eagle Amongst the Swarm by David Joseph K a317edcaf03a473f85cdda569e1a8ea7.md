***A Golden Eagle Amongst the Swarm* by David Joseph Kiluk**

****I pulled off the exit ramp from I-75 somewhere before Dayton, Ohio when I noticed my fuel gauge was dangerously approaching E. I shut my engine off and got out to gas up. The humid summer air was sticky, and my eyebrows couldn’t stop the beads of sweat from rolling to my eyes. I noticed a crowd of tourists gazing skyward and stopped pumping. Looking up, I saw a huge swarm of locusts hovering over the fields west of the gas station. I watched the swarm twist and swirl, finally zooming out over the holden fields of corn which no sane person would dare venture through except for the most dedicated farmers and occasional lost soul. I was a lost soul for the past 20 years and wanted to soar along with the locusts, leaving all my troubles behind to find you on the other side of the wall of crops.

I was making the over 1,200 mile trip for the third time in the last 25 years in order to fill the empty space in my heart and see you again. I didn’t have a clue where to find you or how to contact you, but I knew from an Internet search that you still lived in Central Florida and “might have” been married. I also heard that you had a son. I hoped that we could get back together and that maybe going to Florida a third time would be the charm.

The locusts reminded me of all the static and disturbances in our lives, the twisted curve balls life threw at us, and all the burdens that passed through our hands the last two decades. Maybe the locust migrated from Michigan along with me, pulled by a strong desire to locate a lost friend.

I got back to my car, parked at the side of the building, and turned the AC on full blast. A whiff of chilled air reminded me of the time we spent at the beach staying at that hotel on A1A. We held hands for the first time, walking along the shore as the frothy waves rolled under the soles of our feet.

A rush of memories flooded my head. The time you surprised me hiding in the back of my Toyota and blared Trent Reznor from the speakers. The way you wore my “Destination Unknown” shirt with your locker key in a band around your bronzed ankle when we were at the water park. The trance music tape I still have which your DJ friend made you. The way our lips met on the loveseat in the most passionate, memorable kiss of my life, then and ever since. The glimmer in your bright blue eyes when you told me my name “fit” me because I really was “beloved.” I should’ve told you at that moment that I loved you more than life itself and that your name “fit” you because “beautiful” characterized not only your exceptional good looks but also your mind, heart, and soul. I should’ve told you I would’ve spent the next 20 years at your side instead of painfully missing you, feeling lost without you.

I laid my head against the steering wheel and wondered where you were at that moment and what you were doing. Tears formed in the corners of my eyes. I longed for us to be together like we were that January day under the soft blankets as our skin touched and we glanced shyly at each other. We both broke into simultaneous smiles: there was magic only two could feel, and we knew we had something special.

You trusted me, but I repaid you by abandoning you. I didn’t want to accept what we had because I lacked the self-assurance. I didn’t love myself at the time, and so how could I have loved you? Though I said the words, it would’ve taken a confident and mature man to love you the way you deserved to be loved: I was neither. Any child could’ve told me that I wasn’t ready for a relationship.

I got out of the car and held the golden eagle from my necklace which I wore in your honor toward the swarm of locusts. I hoped the golden eagle would meet the mythical dragon you sent up to your son as a token of your love. I prayed that the eagle would reawaken your love enough so that my face would cross your mind once again after a long period in which you probably tried to forget me.

I wanted you to remember that despite our problems, we felt something once and that I’m sorry for leaving you when you were most vulnerable.

I never made it to Florida, or any further than Ohio. I ended up in a cold place made of concrete and steel instead because love is about caring about another person’s, not your own, desires, goals, and aspirations. It’s not about words but action for another person, putting them before yourself. I failed at that due to my own selfishness. I thought we’d keep in touch, but life happens between those thoughts: I got a different job, you found someone else, seasons entered and ebbed, and time marched on.

I hope it’s not too late to find you one day and that this heartfelt message finds you. I still miss and love you. I still cry out for you on lonely nights. Can you ever forgive me?
