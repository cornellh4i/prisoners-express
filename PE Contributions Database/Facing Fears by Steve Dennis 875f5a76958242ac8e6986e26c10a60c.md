**by Steve Dennis**

When I was young, I was so full of fear. I was literally afraid of being afraid, and so I hid my fears and insecurities with drugs and drink. Little did I know how irreversibly I was destroying everything I held dear.

Eventually, drugs and booze lost their effect of hiding my fears from myself. I moved on to other things. Namely, loose women and illicit sex. Again, while I was desperate to avoid being afraid, I was instead killing my soul with baby steps.

Drugs, booze, and loose women led naturally toward a life of crime which I embraced whole-heartedly, if only to prove how unafraid I am. Living as recklessly as a person possibly could didn’t lessen my fear. It accelerated it.

I find myself today sitting in a maximum security institution with a sentence of 237 years plus 9 consecutive life terms. All I can say is, “What in the hell was I so danged afraid of?” Honestly, I have no clue.

I’m not a mean, violent person. I have never hurt an innocent person in my life, never struck a woman, child or elder. Yet here I sit. Perhaps I was afraid of a society that would lock a thief like me away forever but would keep pervert rapists, child molesters, and abusers free to roam the streets… Just a thought.
