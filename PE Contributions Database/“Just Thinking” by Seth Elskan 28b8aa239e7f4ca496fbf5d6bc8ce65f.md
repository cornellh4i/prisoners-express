**“Just Thinking” by Seth Elskan**

Ved had been stupid and left his apps running while he started thinking about his next voting cycle. Of course his opinions slipped, and he allowed his mind to wander, and next thing he knew LikeThink had updated his public profile before he could wall off his thoughts as private.

There it was: “^VedWillBearIt888 thinks we ought to have more than two political candidates - ‘free elections, where we can vote for whoever we want.’ [Like] [Block] [Report]”

This naturally solicited about 4,000 blocks, 2,000 reports, and virtually all his contacts just abandoned any social link to him. His prestige score plummeted almost instantly, and now he was frantically trying to delete the post and undo the hit to his reputation by filing a bug report, but it was too late now. He knew this.

Something bit him on the cheek and at the same instant, a loud pop sounded a foot or two from his face on the wall. After a moment’s bewilderment, he realized something had shattered some of the stucco of the wall when it impacted there. Something had been thrown at him! From the window two stories up, he spotted a kid in a green hoodie who gave him the finger and spit toward him. A bottle was spinning to rest on the sidewalk at his feet.

Ved ran. Two streets over he spotted a ThotPol team, and he knew they were after him. He tried to flee more inconspicuously. “Run casual,” he thought of himself.

PING! chimed his wearable, and a little orange pip in his upper left visual field notified him of yet another LikeThink posting. He still hadn’t disabled the app, and he was too panicked to focus on Privacy mode.

“^VedWillBearIt888 thinks Damn! ThotPol! Run casual.”

PING! “^VedWillBearIt888 thinks <@#-Family Mode Active-#@> Shut up, LikeThink! Off! Um...okay, concentrate.”

Ved paused to breathe and focus. Taking a few seconds, he shut down all social apps, disabled SafeWhere to avoid public tracking (a bit pointless, as ThotPol didn’t need privs* to locate him, but at least he might avoid more Doxbrats** throwing trash at him), and altered his fabric coloration to try and blend in when he found a crowd. He headed north, thinking to make for a public gathering.

As he came out of a narrow alley onto a backstreet, he ran smack into two ThotPol trackers. The creepy kid-sized prototypes they’d been using lately. This pair (always pairs for tracking) looked as if they’d been at some kind of dance recital or gymnastics thing, but the whip chain cable was serious business.

When Ved ran into them, the optics of his wearable had fallen off and Ved had ended up on his but, scrambling back from them, trying to catch his breath. One of the pair stared down at the optics, the other looked at Ved (or so he assumed - their anonymous facial obfuscation made it hard to tell).

“Vedoran Barret,” emoted the one staring at him, “pseudentity VedWillBearIt eight, eight, eight.” It was not a question.

“Confirmed unit, optics,” stated the one who now picked up his wearable optic by the frame.

“Okay, Meat,” resumed the first one, shifting its stance to what Ved assumed was a tactical position, in case Ved ran. “Stand and be escorted. Don’t resist, and we won’t use the chain, got it?” He mentally named this Thing 1, the other Thing 2.

Ved sighed, resigned, rose to his feet, picking tiny rocks off his palms and waiting for the clamp. “It was a bug,” he offered lamely.

Thing 1 scoffed, a clamp extending from its sleeve to secure Ved’s forearms to his torso. “Sure, always is,” it went on, shaking its head. Then, to Thing 2 “Meat always say that, don’t they?”

“Like recordings,” agreed Thing 2, adding, “Can they even pass a Turing Test at this point?” Both of them laughed. Ved didn’t.

As he shuffled toward a pickup drone for ThotPol, Ved had the notion that he wished he’d just left LikeThink running, so it could finish condemning him.
