****When I think of haircuts, I picture crowded barber shops in urban areas: multi-colored candy cane spinners affixed high above the entrance, jolly barbers merrily dusting off their fancy chairs with a towel before inviting their next client, and the customers still engaged in a high-spirited discussion with other patrons as he takes a seat in the offered chair. As the barber fits the cape around the customer’s neck, he adamantly condemns contemporary shaving methods. Quickly, he mixes up the shaving cream in a small container and using his soft bristled brush, smears it across the customer’s cheek. After wiping the straight razor across his apron several times, he meticulously places the blade against the customer’s face. “Yeah, I tell ya boy. Ain’t nothin’ like a real barber shop shave,” he affirms to the other customers before continuing the process.

This, however, does not describe *my* haircut experience. If anything, it depicts a world that, despite my curiosities, I only viewed from behind the class window. In awe like a child gazing into a colorful aquarium, I often considered going into those neighborhood barber shops but was reluctant to do so. Looking back, I can’t tell you exactly what kept me out of those shops. Perhaps it was because they seemed like sacred tribal territory, hostile to foreign encroachments. Perhaps, my reasons were economical, or I simply didn’t feel comfortable going in there.

I did have haircut adventures, most of which involved my older brother Prince and of which were in a third world country. The barber’s tool wasn’t the popular hair clippers you see everywhere today; rather, it was a loose razor my brother skillfully held against the plastic tooth of a comb with his thumb as he cropped away. Our haircut sessions usually occurred on Saturdays after a quick shower which washed away the layers of dirt and sweat from our fierce, barefooted soccer games.

After the shower, an outdoor event held on a piece of plywood with a bucket, I’d go digging for my small rectangular razor I’d bought and stashed earlier in the week, find a comfortable stool, and go to the “barber shop,” a small commune of portable stools gathered on the bare ground close to the front porch. There, the conversations would flow with a familiarity only siblings could garner. We’d laugh at how we used to hide in anticipation of our father, a strict Pentecostal minister armed with an electric clipper, sought us out. As far as he was concerned, children had no legitimate interest in sporting stylish haircuts, and so we all suffered the same style: baldness… Even the girls!

When I moved to the U.S., my brother would do my hair with his own set of clippers, and we’d talk about how far he’s come from using a razor and comb. These different haircuts made me realize that we should value our own haircut experiences and not want to assimilate into a conventional encounter.
