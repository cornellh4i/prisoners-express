**“Picture Theme” by Cesar Hernandez**

Do not doubt your ability to remove the root cause of the disturbance inside of you. It really can go away. You can look deep within yourself, to the core of your being, and decide that you don’t want the weakest part of you running your life. You want to be free of this. You want to talk to people because you find them interesting, not because you’re lonely. You want to have relationships with people because you genuinely like them, not because you need them to like you. You want to love because you truly love, not because you need to avoid your inner problems.

How do you free yourself? In the deepest sense, you free yourself by finding yourself. You are not the pain you feel, nor are you the part that periodically stresses out. None of these disturbances have anything to do with you. You are the one who notices these things. Your consciousness is separate and aware of these things. You can free yourself. To free yourself of your inner thorns, you simply stop playing with them. The more you touch them, the more you irritate them. Because you’re always doing something to avoid feeling them, they are not given the chance to naturally work themselves out. If you want, you can simply permit the disturbance to come up, and then you can let them go. Since your inner thorns are simply blacked energies from the past, they can be released. The problem is, you either completely avoid situations that would cause them to be released, or you push them back down in the name of protecting yourself.

Suppose you’re sitting at home watching TV, you’re enjoying the program until the two main characters are in love. Suddenly you feel loneliness, but there’s no one around to give you attention. Interestingly, you were fine just a few minutes ago. This example shows that the thorn is always in your heart; it’s just not activated until something touches it. You feel the reaction as a hollowness or a dropping sensation in your heart. It feels very uncomfortable. A sense of weakness comes over you, and you begin thinking about other times when you were left alone and of people who have hurt you. Stored energy from the past releases from the heart and generates thoughts. Now, instead of enjoying TV, you’re sitting alone crushed in a wave of thoughts and emotions.

What can you do to solve this? What you can do is notice that you noticed. You can notice that your consciousness was watching TV, and now it is watching your inner melodrama. The one who sees this is you, the subject. What you are looking at is an object. A feeling of emptiness is an object; it is something you feel. But who feels it? Your way out is to just notice who’s nodrems, it’s really that simple. All you have to do is notice who it is that feels lonely. The one who notices is already free. If you want to be free of these energies, you must allow them to push through you instead of house them inside of you.

Note from typer: I couldn’t read these two words so I made a guess at what they are.
