**"Coffee" by Edward Walsh**

As a boy my breakfast consisted of Cheerios, toast, and Carnation Instant breakfast powder mix. My brother Timmy and I would always eat on the living room couch while watching Captain Kangaroo and The Skipper Chuck Show. I remember my mom telling us to hurry up and eat, "…or I'll turn off the T.V.!"

We lived with my grandma who dedicated her life to us. My mom, along with my grandma, did the best they could raising two wild and independent boys. While Timmy and l ate breakfast mom would busy herself getting ready for work. Grandma would sit on her favorite easy chair and watch the kid's shows with us.

I never liked Cheerios. They always reminded me of little circles of compressed sawdust. No matter how much sugar I put on them, the flavor was always bland. I would only end up with sugar sweet milk and a sugar sludge on the bottom of the bowl. Then, even worst, when I got hypnotized by the Captain or the Skipper those little circles would get mushy. The overly buttered toast would get cold and soggy. The best part of breakfast was the instant breakfast mix. My favorite was the egg-nog, and Timmy always claimed the chocolate flavor.

After I graduated from high school, I joined the Navy. My breakfast was endless cups of coffee, no cream, no sugar. Sometimes if I had time I would join my friends at the base chow hall for an omelet. I would get a three egg, ham, cheese, onion, green pepper, mushroom omelet with hash browns and biscuits, and of course the coffee, no cream, no sugar.

I'm not a morning person. After I wake up I need peace and quiet, and my coffee. Over the years I've stepped into the routine of getting my cup of coffee and taking my dog for a walk. When I lived by the beach we would walk to the water's edge. There I would sit to watch the sunrise over the Atlantic. My dog would be busy doing his dog thing- he had his routine too. When I lived in the country, with my coffee, we would walk the trails in the woods. I would enjoy the trees, birds, fresh air, and my coffee. My dog would sniff every nook and cranny. All in the effort to get my head straight for the day ahead. My walks were my breakfast in a way, my breakfast of solitude and peace. Oh, but on those special occasions or out of pure hunger I'd create myself a big breakfast, with eggs, bacon, and toast. Or, sometimes I would add grits with salt and pepper and a raw egg mixed in. And coffee, no cream, no sugar.

In my later years on Fridays I would meet mom and her husband Mark at their favorite restaurant Cracker Barrel for breakfast. I would wake up extra early to drive ten miles to meet them for the 8am breakfast. Mom and mark, being humans of habit, would always sit at the same table by the big picture window. They would have the same waitress who they knew by name. They even had the menu memorized and every week they would wait patiently for me to read over the numerous breakfast specials. Pancakes, eggs over medium, bacon, hash browns, biscuits with gravy was my favorite. Mom enjoyed pecan pancakes, and Mark had the ham and cheese omelet with hash browns with endless cups of coffee. And I had my coffee too, with no cream, no sugar.

After I would go to their home and sometimes spend the weekend with them. In the mornings, mom and I would sit in the quiet living room eating butter soggy toast and coffee. Mom always saves up a little bit of her toast to share with the dogs. Mark would be at the table eating a bowl of cheerios. He would always ask, "Eddie, would you like a bowl of Cheerios?" and I would respond with "Umm… no thanks Mark."

I'd answer remembering those little circles of flavorless compressed sawdust particles. After Mark would leave for work, mom and I would sit out on the back patio that overlooks the woods. With a second cup of coffee, I always enjoyed our quality time together.

Now I sit in prison. My grandma passed away years ago. A year and a half ago we lost Timmy to cancer. My mom is really sick and she needs me more than ever. Mark is doing the best he knows how. And, I've had a few different dogs to walk for morning breakfast. Now my morning walk is in a straight line with other prisoners to the prison dining hall. My breakfast is served to me on a cold tray. I don’t get to choose what I eat. The one thing that hasn’t changed is my love for coffee, now instant coffee, no cream, no sugar, but coffee nonetheless.

I once made a bad decision and I'm now paying dearly for it. Funny how things go. Simple things that I used to take for granted, things I didn’t like, things long forgotten are now cherished memories. Life was so simple once. I miss breakfast with Timmy and Grandma. There is no more Captain Kangaroo or Skipper Chuck shows. I miss Navy coffee and going to the base chow hall for the huge egg omelets. What i would give to eat a simple bowl of Cheerios, butter soggy toast, and carnation instant breakfast egg-nog. I miss my breakfast coffee walks with my dogs and early morning breakfast with mom and Mark at our favorite restaurant. Most of all, sitting in the quiet living room sharing toast and coffee with my mom. I miss good coffee, no cream, no sugar.
