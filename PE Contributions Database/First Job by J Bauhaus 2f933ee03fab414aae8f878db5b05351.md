My first job was fairly pleasant. I mowed lawns with my big brother who took care of everything. He borrowed the neighbor’s lawnmower to mow their lawn, and after this, I would roll the machine through the neighborhoods as he knocked on doors to solicit business. When we ran out of gas, he would take the can to fill it.

We’d pet the dogs and throw sticks for them, if we could make friends with them. Back then, people were friendly. We didn’t have to lock our houses or cars because everyone was fairly prosperous. We could even cruise for miles without seeing one cop, and when we did, he wasn’t scowling at us like we were something he’d like to chase down and tear apart. Also, while men worked, wives and grandmothers would make tea and insist we drink it. Occasionally, they would bring us cookies or invite us up on the porch to eat a sandwich. For miles, everyone had a big white house and a big green lawn with a few shade trees, some of which bore fruit like apples or persimmons.

A couple of kids could buy a lot of candy bars and pop with only a few dollars from mowing lawns. Candy bars only costed a nickle and were huge and thick compared to today’s bars. These prison-profiteers think that we’ll pay $1.30 for one now. Every year, the prison store candy bar list shrinks as more of us get smart enough to not buy them, especially since they never the lower the price which is double the street price.

Pops were only a dime, and now the dyed sugar water is also $1.30. Only the kids buy it, on their way to bloating out like walruses to weigh 250-300 pounds. No one in the 1960s was walrus-fat except the politicians. While cops used to be lean greyhounds like us, even them have turned into walruses. I’d hate to see all these walruses try to push a mower through thick grass, gasping and wheezing. That was my first job.
