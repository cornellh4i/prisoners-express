Chocolate! Babygirl! Noo Noo and Na Na. Even *itch! All “nicknames” I hear on a daily basis. They say it takes all kinds...and women sure do know how to put a name to them all!

But, wouldn’t it be nice if we assigned nicknames based upon one another’s very best qualities? My best friend would be “Generous”, or maybe “Loyal”. She’s so much of both. My youngest brother would be “Faithful” or “Committed” instead of Buddy. And his wife? Well she would just be AMAZING instead of “Sweetie Girl”.

Instead of calling all of the wild, young women running all around by their “street names”, or even worse, we could just call them “Young Children of God”!

Even the officers have been assigned nicknames…”Cupcake” and “Queen B” and we even have a female “Joe Dirt”! So hard to look beyond some of the nicknames we give them. But, I’ll try...Maybe “Ms. Compassionate”. I know one or two of those. And I do know a “Miss Understanding”. Even a “Miss Helpful”. Oh wait! There are even a few “Mr. Respectful”s around here.

If we were to assign nicknames based upon our best qualities maybe we would all be better people...Maybe it would change how we perceive ourselves and maybe even how we act. It couldn’t hurt to be continually reminded of the good in ourselves. After all, we all know the damage that occurs when we’re constantly reminded of the worst in ourselves. Certainly no one wants to be known as “Thief”! Or “Liar”! Or “Backstabber”! And definitely not “Snitch”! And really, who honestly likes to be called “*itch”?

If we had to be openly called the very best parts of who we are maybe we would be kinder. Honest. Respectful. Giving. Helpful. Forgiving. Loving. And oh wouldn’t it be something if we could mean it every time we call out, “Hey FRIEND!”

Nicknames. From childhood until our adulthood and even sometimes on our graves when we are gone, we wear them, own them, love them...sometimes we can’t stand them! But, good or bad, liked or disliked they are the banners that we wear. We should remember that the next time we assign one to someone else.
