**Thankful By Cris Bazan**

I am thankful to be alive. Even though I am in prison, I am still thankful to be alive. I should’ve died a long time ago. And I should’ve died many more times after that. But, here I am, alive and well, and counting down the months until I am released from prison. I am thankful I have a release date. Too many people here have life sentences; and all of a sudden, life without parole is the norm. I am thankful my parents are still alive. I am thankful my godmother is alive. And, I am thankful for my daughter. But, will they be thankful to have me back?
