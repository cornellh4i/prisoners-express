**“Thwarted” by Mark Webster**

Would you rather be thwarted of martyred?

I say it depends on who you ask,

Because some may see a misconception, but a naked eye doesn’t have to brag

See one can be martyred and praises and some will say he was defeated

And one can be thwarted in a physical sense but mentally elited

The thwarted are just impeded with diseases, until they discover the reason, and sneeze for a cure to catch blessing from “their Jesus”

In this life you are thwarted for trying,

Thwarted for seeking triumph,

Many even fear thwart so they feel they’re better off dying

See if I stand on a corner I’m thwarted,

A target

A sore thumb to be martyred as a product of a generation who never chose to be brought up

If I even find success I’m thwarted by thwart,

From those who feel they froze my mark, and oppose my art

But the root that grows of thwart will never expose my skin or my heart

I see thwart in starch, I see thwart in clovers in march

That’s why I speak folgers to wake up the sharp to play their parts and march

March! To the seas of masses and bestow what was imploded in arks

If you can peel through the falseness of Lewis and Clark's,

Then only will you see the hero that lies on the horizon above the focus of thwart
