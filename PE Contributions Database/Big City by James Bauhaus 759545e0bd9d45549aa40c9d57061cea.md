The big city is where big city politicians get big ideas on how to stampede their ill-educated tax-herds around in circles so that they can suck out ever more tax cash.

One prime example of this is when New York City mayor Bloomberg figured out that he could hide behind the obesity epidemic to tax the hell out of soft drinks bigger than a couple of swigs. He raked in millions of dollars with this scam, and all the shallow thinkers thought he was doing it for the common good. Not a single one of them wondered where those millions vanished off to.

Philadelphia politicians saw Bloomberg pull off this scam and improved on it. They took our tax money and paid public relations firms to make political advertisements showing infants drinking sugar waters, like Coke and Pepsi. Then they had a politician pop up and sell her great idea on how to siphon off a big chunk of soda-pop profits: “Let’s tax these sugar water kings three cents per ounce, and use these millions to pay for day-care school!”

If you don’t think about it, this *does* seem like a great idea! The politicians would rake in even more millions than Bloomberg, and it would buy something useful this time! Or at least, that’s the plan…

Oklahoma politicians used school funding to trick their tax-herds into letting the politicians sell them a lottery. Millions of ignorant, trusting citizens voted for a lottery, which is a tax on stupid people. Millions of stupid people flushed their money away on tickets. A small fraction of the profits went to schools. Most of the profits went into the general fund for the politicians to spend. Also, our cunning politicians began quietly choking off other sources of school revenue, which counteracted their extra lottery bucks. Worse, many stupid people wised up and quit buying lottery tickets.

Now Oklahoma schools are worse off than ever, but the politicians are doing great! They cut income taxes for the rich, gave their cops a raise, bought another prison, and cut funding for the elderly, mentally challenged, child care, schools, nursing homes, and the disabled. Your politicians are no different from Oklahoma politicians, except that you have more and bigger big cities!
