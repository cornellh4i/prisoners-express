**Close Call by Efren Hawkins**

Everyday in life is a close call, because it can be so unpredictable. You never know what’s gonna happen each second of your life. It’s like the environment. Sometime the sun shine and at other times the clouds are dark in a storm.

I remember when I was young my laziness kept me from an apartment that got shot up. I never forget it because it's the same week my grandfather had passed away. Me and one of my classmates was cruising around in my car. I dropped him off at his cousin’s apartment, where we chilled at, because I had to take care of some business. After I was finished, I went to my mom’s house and ate some cake and watched TV. As time passed I saw that I had been laid back for a minute. So, I got up and headed to our spot we all chilled at. As I pulled up, I saw people and police everywhere, I received info that my partner I had dropped got killed. The worst part about it was my cousin that did the shootings and he shot in the wrong apartment. The dude he was after lived next door.

I went and got back in my car and drove to my grandmother's house, as I thought about that could have been I that died. So that was a close call for me and I was only 16 at the time.

But, through life you are gonna go through a number of close calls. So, we need to give thanks for all that we make it through. You got to remember all of the people that didn’t make it. I just reflect on that. It could have been sitting in that seat, if I had been on time.
