**“Post-Apocalyptic Loyalties” by Steven P. Arthur**

****Rakes took an unsteady step and nearly dropped his friend slung on his shoulders. “Damn, Rhonchi. How did you gain weight since training camp?”

The only response from the unconscious man was a groan. Rakes continued to walk through the hills of burnt sand and unidentifiable debris of long forgotten wars. He knew somewhere over the distant mountains was the Righteous Heathens camp. He didn’t like calling it home, but that’s what it was: the only home he had known. There were rumors of other places beyond the black glass deserts, with cities and people more like what they used to be.

Who could survive the trip? Nobody could live any closer to those ancient deserts than what they did now. They were the gatekeepers. Nobody in or out. If you wanted through Rainshadow Pass, you had to come through Rakes and his Echo team. That is exactly what some of the Earthdwellers had done. They must be desperate. Earthdwellers don’t travel during the day. Because of their milky white skin and sensitive pink eyes, they stay buried in their burros until the last light of the day. Nobody expected them, and that is why he carried the burden of his murdered team and his brother who was soaking his back with blood. The Dwellers are silent when they kill. They don’t use weapons but rather unnaturally sharpened teeth and claws. “Hold on, Rhonchi. We’re almost there.”
