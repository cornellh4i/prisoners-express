**“Daisy” by Shane Hartman**

Daisy was born in May of 1935, in a small town in middle Tennessee. Life was tough; she was only allowed a third grade education before circumstances at home forced her to stay at home and help take care of her brothers, sisters, and mother. Her father worked as a logger, and did the best he could for his large family. Her mother was bed ridden with sickness. Little Daisy learned early that life was tough and unfair, but her own toughness, love, and belief in God, and her loving, giving spirit made it bearable. She raised her siblings, cooked for the family, cleaned, and cared for her mother.

She met S.C. and was married in 1950. They were young, but both were used to poverty and hardships, and knew how to survive. S.C. was sent off to Korea early in the marriage. While he was away Daisy continued to help care for her family while awaiting the return of her beloved S.C. Once he returned they resumed their lives with babies coming, hard work, and surviving day to day.

They had three sons and a daughter. They built a loving home, raised their children to be God loving, hard working, respectful, humble people. Trials and tribulations came and went. Their home burned to the ground early in their marriage. They rebuilt on the same ground. As in all things, nothing is perfect or stays the same. The kids grew up and moved out with lives of their own.

One of the sons got into some trouble and things went from bad to worse. In 1980 he was sentenced to death row in a Tennessee rison. That son of Daisy’s and S.C.’s had a son of his own who was four years old at that time. The grandson came to live with Daisy and S.C. She loved him and cared for him like her own. The son going to prison was devastating to the family, but they all stuck together and made it through on faith, love, and family. Then another blow came down on the family: S.C. was diagnosed with lung cancer. After a short battle with aggressive cancer, S.C. passed away in late 1985. Daisy was devastated, but true to her nature, she lifted her chin, straightened her back, and trekked on.

Daisy was a rare lady. She never faltered in her faith, never compromised her beliefs, never blamed any of life’s hardships on God; she just gave more love and caring to those around her. She worked hard at the same company for over thirty years, even though they refused to pay her fairly or recognize her dedication. She believed in keeping your word and being loyal even to those who didn’t deserve it.

She raised her grandson with the same beliefs and philosophy on life as she had lived on. She gave him her heart, wisdom, security, and all the love and understanding one could ask for. Yet, he was hard headed, thought he knew it all in this youth, and wouldn’t listen to reason. He broke that lady’s heart more than can be counted on both hands and feet. He was constantly in and out of jail, in trouble of every kind, in and out of relationships. He couldn’t keep a job, a place to live, or even clothes on his back at times. But Daisy never gave up on him, and never faltered in her love, understanding, or caring. She prayed for him constantly.

In 2007 while the grandson was finishing a short prison sentence in a Georgia prison, his father died of cancer in a Tennessee prison. When the grandson was released later that year, nothing had changed for him. He was still bent on destroying his life. In 2008 that beautiful lady lost her life to a stroke, but all the years of worry and stress over her son and grandson were the real killers.

I still carry a heavy burden over that. I am the grandson. But, that same kid that came to this prison system has finally started to put all of that wisdom and advice she shared to use and has started to become the man that she always thought he could be.

For many years I mourned her loss, these days I celebrate her life. I love you Daisy, the most beautiful flower of my life.
