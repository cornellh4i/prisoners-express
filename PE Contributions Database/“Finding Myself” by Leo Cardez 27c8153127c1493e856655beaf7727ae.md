**“Finding Myself” by Leo Cardez**

When I was 30 years old I travelled alone to Europe. I started in Budapest, Hungary and planned to visit as many cities as possible in two months over the summer. It was a dream come true.

I spent a week hopping back and forth across the Danube river visiting Buda, then Pest, then back again. Did you know Budapest is actually two cities? I didn’t. I do now.

I spent a few days in Austria visiting beautiful buildings and eating schnitzel (thin, breaded chicken). Then Prague — the women there were gorgeous — it’s all I can remember.

I was fulfilling a lifelong dream, but somehow I was missing something. I took photos, enjoyed the sites, but it all lacked… flavor. It felt cold, insipid, and pointless. My favorite part of my day was during my brief calls with my family and friends back home. It’s not so much that I missed being home. I wasn’t homesick. I just missed not having them there to share these experiences.

In Dubrovnik, Croatia (a beautiful, walled city on the Adriatic seashore), I found myself looking out to the sea watching the sun set over an archipelago including Hrar, a party island I planned to visit the next day with a melancholy heart. I immediately knew what I had to do.

Within 48 hours I was back in the States renting a small beach house on the Michigan shore. I invited all my friends and family to come visit over the summer. We swam, drank beer, ate hotdogs off the grill, and shared old memories while creating new ones.

Part of growing up is finding out who you are in the world. I thought I had to go to exotic far-away lands to find myself. As it turns out, I wasn’t far at all, just a couple hours drive surrounded by the people I love.
