**“Finding Inspiration” by Anonymous**

One of my fellow Prisoners’ Express (PE) writers has inspired me to become a better writer. Catherine gave me a wonderful compliment in one of her pieces. At first, I did not notice it. When I re-read the piece, I realized she was in fact referring to me. I had no idea that my writing could be meaningful to someone else. I consider many PE writers to be better at writing than myself.

Several PE writers have stated that Catherine is their favorite writer. That applies to me as well. When I receive something from PE, I first look to see if there is a piece by her. One of my favorite pieces was when she wrote about Mildred the Bear.

She mentioned in one of her pieces that her fellow PE writers know more about her than those around her. I would say the same for myself. I have no interest in the people nearby. I was moved to my current cell one year ago. I have not spoken a single word to my neighbor. Although, that’s not saying much. About eighty percent of the people in our building do not talk to my neighbor. I cannot have an intelligent conversation with people here so I speak very few. Someday, I can go an entire day without speaking more than ten words. I refuse to try to reason with stupidity.
