Wow! Never knew that. Interesting I learned this while in a cell…

But focus on those meanings, Listen! To block (right?). Yeah! I did that - to myself. OK hinder, yeah did that too! Not just to myself. My family, friends plus those of you all I could have met out there in ya livelihoods (without the way you see me in here ‘prison’... the hhinder is all mine, so I apologize for that. We should have in real time cause Prison time isn’t Real it’s Man-Made! This I know! So should you all understand. Now!!! Comes frustrated. Over 10 years, 15 years, in prison, jail, cell-blocks, units (houses). Men after men, hard legs after hard legs, the streets are real, pain that is felt in frustration hurt, harm, lost, unable to see the very Noun in this definition in the form of that sentence. “A seat across a boat that a rower sits on.” That this in the form. Me being the very word thwarted. Understand the very seat I sit across this boat looking at the next face after face a rower sits on.

Yeah ! Ya! Don’t! hear Me!!!

Perhaps the 12 jurors should have heard Me!!!
