**by Sarah Julie Spencer**

It was an indecisive Fourth of July morning in Santa Barbara. At first it was overcast, and almost began to rain. Matt, Sarah, Terry, and Bret couldn’t decide if they should watch the parade or go hiking. Off they all went in Matt’s 1977 Toyota Corolla to park and wait for the parade.

After five minutes, Matt’s 18 year-old date, Sarah, was antsy. Back to the car they all piled in and drove to a nice array of hiking trails going up the mountains. As the sun peeked through the clouds, it was still a cool day and definitely not too warm for a hike.

However, indecision still loomed over their minds that day, for when they approached a painting with four different trails to choose from, each looked at the others expecting a decision. No decision was forthcoming. Ultimately, the day’s decisions seemed to rest on Sarah’s shoulders, as the youngest of the group. For the other three were college graduates already, and she was in the summer preceding her sophomore year.

Terry and Bret had just graduated from a small private college. Matt was a Yale grad but had come out to California to accept a managerial position at the same college Sarah attended now. Feeling honored to lead the way, she chose the path less traveled into the mountainous ascent.

It was not too long before they appeared to be inside a labyrinth. Each path seemed to lead to another dead end. Sarah panicked as she couldn’t locate the other three, so she screamed slightly over and over until they located her.

Although the group was together again, still no one had any inkling of which way to proceed. They mutually decided to go back where they started from, but this point could not be located!

One person, a tall lanky older man, passed by them too quickly to even ask for directions. Apparently, everyone else in Santa Barbara, and those from out of town, had all opted to watch the parade. With no one to ask for help, they decided to stay close together and choose a single path, preferably one that led to the car. When they came upon a bench next to a barely-bubbling brook, they decided to rest and have lunch.

Through the trees’ tops they spied the sun high overhead. Someone commented that it was already noon. The tree tops, the bubbling brook, the sun’s warmth, and the fat tree trunk that lay nearby all made for a cozy lunch of French rolls, cheese chunks, a gallon of white wine, and some doobies.

Exhausted from the morning hike, they lingered long over lunch next to the bubbling brook. But they still had to find their way out! None of them had had any breakfast, so all of their stomachs were still growling. They made tentative plans for the Sizzler later.

First on the agenda was to find their way out of the beautiful Fourth of July mountain trails! Path after path yielded no hope in finding their way back to where they had started.

As night began to fall, the four travelers lost all hope of ever returning to their starting point below. It was tremendously dark as they approached what appeared to be a flat area near the top of the mountains.

They stood still, experiencing the pitch blackness and quiet all around them. Up above, they saw hundreds of stars barely illuminated. A helicopter suddenly appeared as Matt and Sarah stood arm in arm. Confused and bewildered, they suddenly realized the helicopter was landing on the flat area they stood by.

This was when the four of them realized they had gotten so utterly lost that a helicopter had arrived to airlift them off the top of the mountain.
