**“Supper’s On” By Jack Simpson**

There is nothing on Earth that is sly as a fox. At least that is what I’ve been told. It has been a long night and today I will have to leave my mate and pups to hunt for food. There is no easy task when the little ones are hungry. I have a lot of friends who will help me. Some I just can’t count on.

The pickings will be slim since most are already about looking for a meal. The houses nearby have a variety of leftovers, still I have to be careful. Not everybody likes a fox. Most of all one who has raided a hen house. Trial and error is the way I live.

Just so happens there is a farm that is only a mile away. I know they have nice juicy chickens. At least they did a couple of weeks ago. A fox gets tired of eating the same thing over and over. Field mice just aren’t meaty enough. But a chicken: that is plenty for the day. I know the little lady will be happy with whatever I bring. Don’t laugh, it isn’t like I can go into a hamburger joint and order four to go.

It took awhile at the neighborhood. Nothing to brag about at the first house. Some leftover soup. Maybe the second house has a little better to offer. Nope! Nothing but a few chicken leg bones. No meat. This is getting me nowhere. Can’t go home empty. The last time I nearly lost an ear.

No use in hanging around here. Should have went on to the farm first. There has to be something worthwhile. Have to stop and rest as I’m running low on fuel.

I closed my eyes for a moment. At least I thought it was. A couple of hours later, my legs stretch and I’m on my feet. I let out a yawn. The farm couldn’t be more than a hundred yards. Still have to be alert. I know they had a dog and he just disappeared one day.

The yard looks clear. Wait a minute; there is a girl in the yard. What is that she has in her hand? Some kind of thing with wheels on it. There, it moved by itself. It can’t be. This is my lucky day. That is the biggest chicken I have ever seen. Just look at that. I could feed my family for days with that. Have to control myself. Just one more backflip. That will do it.

That girl just won’t go away. She just lingered around, rubbing that big chicken. Slowly, I crept around the edge of the field. Just out of sight. This is just too good to be true. The girl ran inside the house. Still I have to wait. It could be a trick. Once I was able to get close enough to see what it was, I realized it wasn’t a chicken after all, but a big goose. That is even better. There will be extra meat.

Now I know why it was sitting. It was too heavy to fly and that thing was holding it. That is good for me, I won’t have to drag it. Hope that girl stays away.

Once I was behind it, I could see it was preoccupied. Not a sound was made. When he turned his head and looked at me, my paws were already on the handle. I tried to push with my hind legs. I had gotten weaker by traveling such a distance. Still he made no sound. Just that look he gave let me know I was wasting my time.

No matter how hard I tried, it just wasn’t going to move. If I get you home your goose will be cooked. What do you think of that? My eyes felt as if they were going to pop out. This will have to be abandoned. No one likes to admit defeat. Most of all a sly fox.

Returning to the den empty wasn’t a positive note. I tried to explain how big the chicken was. I did tell her it was a goose instead. Two hungry pups and when she bit my ear, leaving two holes, I knew I would be sleeping on the other end of the den. I’ll give it another try tomorrow. I’m just too tired. I’ll close my eyes and dream of Supper’s On.
