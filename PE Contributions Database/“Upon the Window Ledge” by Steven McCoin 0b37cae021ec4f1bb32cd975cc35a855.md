**“Upon the Window Ledge” by Steven McCoin**

This is my girl without a face

She sits upon a window ledge

This is no ledge at all

All-day she sits there still as stone

Although she cannot fall

Her presence fills a lonely space

I contemplate her silent voice

And her unseeing eyes

Her gaze betrays her solemn pose

Although she never sighs

Hypnotic is her style and grace

The city waits beyond her reach

So close, yet far away

For her to talk I do beseech

Although she won’t today

She is my girl without a face
