"Girl On Bench" by Chris Fleming

When I look at this picture I see this young, lovely woman. She really hasn’t found herself yet, her true identity is in crisis. She always pretends to be happy even though for the most part, she is depressed. When she looks into the mirror she is disgusted. Screaming on the inside for help, just for one moment she wants to come out of her shell. Don’t get me wrong, she knows she’s pretty but always fails to realize how beautiful she is. Thus, she resorts to hiding her face behind makeup that distorts her natural beauty.

That girl is always dating the same type of guys, not knowing that the guy she has always considered “just a friend” and nothing more, is the man of her dreams. She is blinded by the advice of her friends, by social media, and the troubling influences of the world. That is why when I look at her in this photo, all I really see is your every day 16 to 24-year-old girl who is confused and needs true guidance in her life.
