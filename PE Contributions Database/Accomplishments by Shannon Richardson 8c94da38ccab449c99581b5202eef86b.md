**Accomplishments by Shannon Guess Richardson**

What do you think of when you hear the word “accomplishments”? Do you think of your sport glory days? Do you think of your academic successes? Do you think of the degree you struggled for? Do you think of the first car on home you brought for yourself ? Do you think of your career?

Personally, when I think of accomplishments, six come to mind. Branden. Allan. Taylor. Ethan. Logan. Brody. My children are my greatest accomplishments and my greatest joy. My heart and soul. My other successes won’t matter when I’m gone, but the six amazing boys of the next generation absolutely will. Each one of them will change the world in some way.

When I think of my children, I wonder how in the world anyone could hurt a child? I was raped repeatedly as a child. Look around me and am appalled and disgusted by the women around me who have committed sexual crimes against innocent babies. I just don't understand.

Accomplishments can come in many forms. I have many that are near and dear to my heart, but none more than my precious sons. I feel that I was born to bring them into this would. They are my greatest accomplishments, my legacy, and my gift to the world.

What’s your greatest accomplishment?
