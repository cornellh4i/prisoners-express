**Gratitude by Cedric Davis**

I was adopted by my aunt, my biological mother’s sister, when I was just a baby. My mother was only fifteen years old, with two other kids already. There was no way that she could take care of all three of us. She couldn’t even take care of herself. For that reason, and because I was sick with asthma, she gave me up for adoption and for that I am grateful.

My biological mother died in 2001 and I did not get the chance to express my gratitude for the courage that she displayed in the actions she took: giving me up for adoption so I could have a better life than the one she could provide for me.

With every chance I get now, I try to show gratitude for my aunt who adopted me, who I call my mom. I am grateful for the sacrifices that she made in loving me and giving me a chance to live. Although I may have disappointed her by going to prison, I am grateful that she is still with me today. I am showing her my gratitude in my accomplishments from behind these walls by writing and publishing books that will benefit and help change the lives of others, like how she benefited and changed my life.
