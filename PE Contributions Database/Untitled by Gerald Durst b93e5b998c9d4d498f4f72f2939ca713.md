**By Gerald Durst**

It was 5:30 in the afternoon as I walked up the diner. Laverne and Jacky were already there, waiting for me to show up. This was our usual Friday ritual, to meet up for a good sit down dinner, then head home to our apartment for a relaxing, fun-filled weekend.

This weekend was gonna be our stay at home weekend. These were my favorite weekends. It meant that we were going to entangle ourselves in a menage a trois. Yes, that’s correct. We were a little freaky. Sometimes, we even had a second guy there, but he was gay, and strictly there for me.

We were kind of like the trio from “Three’s Company.” Only, I’m not pretending to be gay in order to live with two women; rather I was having sex with them both.

And yes, I do loved them both.

Life was good, we love each other, have lots of fun, and are near inseparable. Naturally, not everyone in our families approve of our lifestyles, but the ones who count most, our parents, back us all to the hilt. Especially Jacky’s mom. She keeps asking when she’s gonna get to be a grandma.

Anyways, as I came up, the girls were clowning around out front. Laverne was leaning her back against the bricks wearing her desert-sand colored jumpsuit and jacket with hearts and polka dots pattern. It was almost a desert camo, and it fit all her courses very nicely.

She kept her black hair short at the bangs, almost to the bottom of her ears, so they peek-a-poo-ed at the side, and collar length at the back. She wore very little makeup, and that was only for work at the office. At home, she and Jacky wore none. As a matter of fact, Jacky hated makeup and wore none at all ever. She hated for reasons unknown to the rest of us. She was tomboy all the way, but she could be a lady.

Jacky was leaning her right hand on the wall with her left resting on her cocked-out, curvy hip. She was in her hip-hugger jeans and her favourite mid-drift-showing blue jean shirt. She was showing off that cute little belly button. I loved poking my finger in there, and giving her a good ol’ tickle until she begged for mercy.

She had long, wavy, brown hair. I loved to sit and brush her hair after she’d gotten out of the shower. She took very good care of her hair. It had a smooth texture to it that flowed through my fingers, and the brush. It rarely ever tangled.

Between her lips she held the rare cigarette. We gave up long ago trying to get her to stop smoking them, even if they were just occasional.

When I came up towards the diner, they both threw their arms open and wrapped me up in a group hug. Thankfully Jacky had spit out the cig first. I wrapped my arms around their waist on either side and hugged them close feeling their bodies pressed into mine, and giving their bottoms a pat. Then we exchanged kisses.

“You two hungry?” I asked.

Laverne had that sultry look in her eyes, the one she got when she had her mascara on. She looked me up and down in my jeans and work shirt.

“Mmm, very hungry” she purred.

Jacky giggled, “You slut! At least wait til we get home before you jump him.”We all laughed.

“Come on let’s get dinner so we can go home for dessert.” I said.

With my arms around their waists, I guided them to the door, holding it open. I let them enter first. “I’ve got some exciting news to tell y’all,” Jacky said as she walked by, sliding her fingertips across my left cheek and chin.

“Can’t wait to hear this,” I replied.

“Did you get a raise at work?” Laverne asked.

“You two will have to wait. Let’s eat first.” Jacky said.

After getting seated at our usual table, the waitress, Tabitha, came over with our drinks, saying, “Hey guys!” she said in her bubbly voice, “Your food will be out in a bit.”

“Thanks, Tab, you’re the best.” I said.

“You’re welcome. Be back in bit.” she said. We all watched Tabitha’s hips sway under her short skirt as she headed back behind the counter.

“So when are we going to invite her to join our party for a night?” asked Laverna, “You know all three of us want her.”

“Tonight would be a great night,” said Jacky, “She can join our celebration.”

“What are we celebrating?” I asked.

“Just wait, here comes dinner.” Jacky said.

Tabitha walked over with our food and her ample breasts balanced on a huge tray. Today she was teasing us in a low cut, sleeveless, powder-blue blouse that advertised what was inside by slowing plenty of cleavage. She also sported a huge smile on her lovely, angelic face that lit up the whole diner by itself. Her hips were swaying like a model’s on the catwalk. She had the steps down. When she wasn’t waitressing, or advertising her desires to us, in her subtle ways, she did do some modeling locally. Yes, she knew all about us, and wanted to join us. We were known to invite a third girl or cute gay guy from time to time.

“Here ya go gang. One caesar salad and rolls for Laverne, one ribeye and baked potatoes for Jacky, and one chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes with cream gravy and peas for handsome here.”

“Thanks Tab,” said Jacky. “Got a question for ya, Precious.”

“Ok, go for it,” she said with a touch of excitement in her voice.” Her eyes shined knowing that today was the day.

“How would you like to go home with us to celebrate some good news tonight?”

Tabitha began to squeal, giggle, dance a jig, and clap her hands, “Yes, yes, yes!”

Catching her breath, she asked “What’s the celebration for?”

Jacky had cut a piece of her rib eye, after dashing some A1 sauce on it, and had it hovering at her lips, her eyes danced from one of us to another.

“I’m pregnant,” she said, then slipped the steak between her lips and chewed. Laverna and I just sat there, stunned, like someone just slapped the hell out of us. Tabitha squealed once, like a mouse, her hands flying to her mouth. Jacky swallowed, grinned, and broke the silence. “Surprise!”

We all went wild with cheering, laughter, clapping, and tears. The other patrons gave us dirty looks until we announced to them what the celebration was about. Then they joined us in our joy; there were handshakes, hugs, and joy all around.

After we ate, we stayed around until Tabitha punched the clock. We left there arms-in-arms, stopped at a liquor store for a good bottle of champagne, and then home for a wonderful weekend. And wouldn’t you know, it was Tabitha’s one weekend a month to be off.

Tabitha began joining us regularly. She moved in four months later, and shared Laverne’s room. Jacky had a beautiful baby boy that we named Jr.. Plus Jacky’s mom was so happy to be a grandma. Today, Laverne is three months pregnant. Jr. is walking. Jacky and I are married. Tabitha wants to get pregnant. And we are looking at a 6 bedroom colonial style house for our little family to grow into.
