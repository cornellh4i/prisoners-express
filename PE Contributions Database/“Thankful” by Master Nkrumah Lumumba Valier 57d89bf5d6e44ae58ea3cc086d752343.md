**“Thankful” by Master Nkrumah Lumumba Valier (Master Builder-- Truthologist)**

What I must be thankful for in life is that I am alive today, and I am in good healthy mentally, physically, and spiritually. I am thankful that these events occurred in my life. Though coming to prison is not something to be thankful for, it did open my eyes to what is real. And I resurrected myself from the dead--something they claim only God and Jesus have been able to do. So does that make me a God too? I was mentally dead and my state of mind created illusions that kept me asleep. Once we have found ourselves, how can we ever be lost again?

I am thankful for my eyes, my ears, my nose, tongue, lips, arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, toes, and every vital organ in my body that works perfectly.

I am thankful for being born black in spite of all the negativity that it attracts because of racial discrimination. When I see myself in the mirror I thank God for blessing me with making me in his image. So when all those who know the truth look at me, they see the real God every time. If you understand what I just said, be thankful that God gave you that knowledge.

I am thankful for a lot of things in life so I’ve learned to never complain when bad things occur. What I am truly thankful for is my son Alton, his brothers Jordan, Caleb, and Devin, and my beautiful daughter Ashlee because I helped create life--something no other gift in this world can compare to. And through their lives a part of me will live forever every time they create a life. My love for all my children will never change no matter what, because that love is for real. I can never thank God enough for my children because they mean the world to me and I am thankful for all I do have in life. We should all be thankful for what we do have in our lives and stop complaining about what we don’t have. Because some people have nothing.
