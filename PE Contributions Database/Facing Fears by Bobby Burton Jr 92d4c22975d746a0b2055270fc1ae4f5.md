**by Bobby Burton Jr.**

****Now I’ve always feared the Lord, but there is nothing else I ever fear but God. So I’m going to tell you now I know God is for real, and he wants us to fear him.

So I was walking down a dirt road in the dark, and I saw a light in the bushes as I went to see what it was. The light just vanished, and so I figured it was an angel or even God himself.

I know from that day that He is real, and God has a plan for his children. I was so scared yet bold that night, and so ever since, I feared the Lord my friend. I also have had car wrecks, and I should have died, but I didn’t. I feared I’d leave the world not knowing my mother or father was saved.

I feared losing my father to the lake of fire, and this is still fear. So now I talk more about Christ to my family and friends.
