There is absolutely no way I am EVER going to be able to fix this!

Do you SEE me? I mean REALLY see me?

All turned around and inside out. I swear I don’t remember exactly when this happened...or even HOW it happened. Maybe it occurred so slowly I didn’t notice. Maybe it happened in microseconds. One broken promise, one death, one lost dream at a time. Now here I am...All turned inside out and trying to look through the mess of life that lies before me. I don’t think this can be fixed. What do YOU think? Do you think a lifetime of holding in and bottling up and clinging to and grieving when the good is ripped away can be put back in place? Once it has just fallen right on out and into the open for all the world to see…Once you can no longer hold back the tears and the pain and the embarrassment and the hurt and the loss and all of the humiliation!...What then?

Am I supposed to just continue to walk around trying to hold in all of the parts of myself? When you feel like your soul needs a colostomy bag to catch all of the mess, what then?

I see the sadness and confusion seeping right on out. I see the fear and the hurt and the anger and the multitude of unanswered questions threatening to just pour right on out and hit the floor. I wonder, if I just let them, will they finally GO AWAY? Will I no longer feel the suffocating fear? The misery? The complete and total emotional isolation of holding in so many tortuous events?

What if I just REFUSE to hold it all together any longer? What if I just fall onto the floor, and once and for all, be allowed to grieve for all that I have lost? For all that I have born witness to? For all that have left me behind?

What will happen then?

Will anybody even notice?

Will life continue to walk on by and walk over and walk around and refuse to LOOK AT ME? Will it be too much to witness? Or like a horrible collision on the freeway, will everybody stop and stare?

Then what? Do as I have always done and get up? Get back up and a take a deep breath as I wipe the river of tears from my eyes? Suck it all in and up? Return to life as usual?

When will I no longer be able to hold in the anger? The regret? The fear and self-imposed emotional isolation?

WAIT! Did you see that? Did you see what it is I’m looking at from back here? That resolve. That glimmer of HOPE! Oh sweet human capacity to get back up! To strive and thrive and rise and hold on.

Yes...here it is. I see it clearly now. That was close. I thought I had lost it and it was right here all along. The rising of the phoenix! The surrendering of the will!

It put all of my pieces back. Huh...pretty amazing, don’t you think?

Guess I’ll make it after all. I didn’t even know I had it in me. I’ve never been introduced to this part of myself.

Hello you beautiful conqueror! Hello you survivor! Hello you glorious spirit that just WILL NOT give up or give in or fall all out on the floor after all! It’s REALLY good to meet you. It’s REALLY good to know that you exist inside of me. That I am ABLE...And CAPABLE...and that I WILL keep all of the pieces put together and I will thrive and accomplish and I will GROW! Right here...right now...right where I am planted.
