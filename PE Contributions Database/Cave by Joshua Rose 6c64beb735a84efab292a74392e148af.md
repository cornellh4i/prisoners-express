**Cave by Joshua Rose**

This looks like hope to me

Finally out, Finally Free.

Smell the trees,

Feel the breeze.

Warm as the sunlight streaming

Happy as the bird’s sweet singing

One day I’ll find my way there

Out of this bleak cavern of despair.

One day I will find my out

This is hope

This is promise
