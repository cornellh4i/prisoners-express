**"Women In Water" by Daniel Alvarez**

War is hell. War shows no mercy. One must dig down and pull every inch of their fiber to survive. Survival is the most important thing. You cannot rest and you cannot quit if you intend to survive. War does not care if you are old or young. War is relentless, so in turn you must be relentless to survive war. When you feel you’re about to faint, pass out, or not go any further, you must muster more energy and go that extra mile. You cannot let the battle defeat you. You must prepare for the next stage in the war. You cannot dwell in the past. Look back only to make sure you’re not being followed. Resting only in secure places. No matter what kind of terrain you must travel through, you must advance. Humans have lived on the terrains of earth for thousands of years. Today, so must you. This is but one challenge in life. You cannot let one obstacle defeat you. You must strive to persevere. You’ve done so much to live life to this very point. Why stop now? Never give up hope. Never give in. Giving in is not an option. So step by step, mile by mile, you must overcome the enemy. Your enemy seeks to take the very essence of life away from you. While you choose to preserve life as you know it, your very livelihood depends on your victory. You must outrun your enemy. You must outthink your enemy. Surrender, never! Quit, absolutely not! In these uncertain moments, that’s when you must excel. When you feel you’ve gone far enough, go further! Think quickly! You must trust your intuition and spatial reasoning. Have faith in yourself. You didn’t make it this far in life without rising to the challenge. All the haters and the naysayers are left behind. Today greatness awaits. All the training, exercise, and hard work has been to prepare you for this moment. Nothing can hold you back. You must fight tooth and nail. Take the leap of faith. Have faith in yourself. And then finally when you see the sun rise slowly, you realize you are alive and you’ve made it another day. Then you can rest slowly.
