**Holding Hands by Teddy Lewis**

The trip we’re about to take is a lifelong journey into the deeper depths of the Earth! Hold my hand and generate the sun’s rays inside us and don’t worry. The universal guide is God, the Creator, so how can we lose?

It’s so early in the morning that I sense the beauty of the clouds radiating on our journey yet now I’m inspired to keep walking into a frontier of such paradise like no other.

I see a world within a world which holds the blueprint of success right here right now you heard?

Take my hand and don’t be afraid, OK?

I know you love me and this is the most powerful force known to us all there for the Earth cries tears of joy forever and ever.

Peace
