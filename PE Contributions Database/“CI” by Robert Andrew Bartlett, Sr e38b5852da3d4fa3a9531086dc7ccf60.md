**“CI” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

James was my best friend when we were growing up. We spent a lot of time together climbing trees, playing hide and seek (he always found me) riding bikes, searching for arrowheads, skinny-dipping, fishing, or just hanging out.

As we got older, my parents’ attitude changed. They seldom let him stay overnight and never let me spend a night at his house. I couldn’t figure out why they didn’t like him. SUre, there were a few little things they wouldn’t have approved of, like the time we snuck behind the hardware store and smoked a cigarette, but I was sure they didn’t know of that.

We lost touch for a year of two, and when he returned home from the Army, he had a couple of tattoos and was rowdier than ever. He was smoking more often and not just tobacco.

We shared a couple of joints at a party, and I had a feeling he was dealing a little. It didn’t surprise me when he asked me to deliver a small package to one of the guys I worked with. I had an idea about what was probably in it, but I didn’t want to know.

It’s good to have a friend you can trust.

I spent three years in prison.

I learned how to pick locks, weaponize plastic bags, and sharpen a shank. I learned several new ways to masturbate when the guards weren’t looking, and when a couple ways when they were (Miss Smith once paid me a honey bun). I learned how to hustle, how to con new inmates out of their money, and I improved my card game until I could make at least ten dollars a week at the poker table.

I learned that James had been busted for trafficking, but he copped a plea and got off with six months probation.

I thought about that a lot: I recalled how James told me, during one of our more serious philosophical dialogues, to trust no one. Always stare your enemy in the eyes, but watch your friends covertly. Keep personal and business information on a need-to-know basis, and our most important secret is not to be shared with anyone. Show your enemy your fists and let your friends see your hands. In life as in poker, keep your arms above the table, but always have an ace up your sleeve.

Although I totally disregarded what he told me, I had always trusted him.

I gave the eulogy at James’ closed casket funeral. I spoke of the little boy everyone loved, and I said nothing of how he died. I’ve never told anyone what I know about that drug deal that went bad. Privately, I shared with a friend after the intermission the best advice James ever gave me. On the way to a poker game one Friday night, he told me: Don’t watch your dealer’s hands. They’re too fast for you. Watch his eyes.
