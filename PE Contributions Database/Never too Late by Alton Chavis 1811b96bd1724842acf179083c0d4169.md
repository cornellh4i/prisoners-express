**“Never Too Late” by Cambren Thomas**

To Carter, the hands on the wall clock moved with the slow succession and sound of a swinging pendulum of doom. His throat was a desert, his palms a sauna, his heart a flat stone skipping randomly across still water. The lively conversations going on around him, reverberated in his ears like hollow sounds in an aquatic abyss. He had waited, and slightly dreaded for so long to taste this moment -- and he had no idea whether it would be sweet or sour.

Carter looked at her as if he were a jeweler with a monocular to his eye, appraising some rare gemstone. She returned his curious gaze with a layered stare, that was either a welcoming oasis or quicksand. Carter knew that he needed to burst the growing bubble of silence between them. He had known for close to two decades what needed to be said. But, distracting thoughts surged through his brain like a cacophony of explosive fireworks displays, erupting in a rousing finale…

“She finally came to see me! Look at her! She’s beautiful like her mother. The same light skin. The same short and fit build. Those bouncy curls of brown hair, with a hint of red in them. Those same dimples, that try and hide when she’s nervous.”

“I see myself in her features too! That little mound of a nose. Those big brown eyes, with an almost exotic slant to them. The inquisitive dents in that undeniable Carter family forehead. I can’t believe she’s a woman now!”

“There’s so much, too much, to catch up on! Did she get all of my letters, and the birthday cards? I wonder what she thinks of me? She must have questions? What’s she up to now? Work? College? I wonder what she loves? I wonder what she hates -- me? I wouldn’t doubt it.”

Carter’s continued mental meanderings reached critical mass, and imploded into uncertainty. But, he slowly transported himself back through the infinity of time and space, toward the threshold of reality. His focus materialized, back to the monotony of the threadbare visitation room he was in with his estranged daughter.

He knew it was time now. Carter pushed the knot in his throat aside, with a dull fleshy thud. His bladder chimed in, to pester him with a resonating pang to be emptied. He closed his legs tightly, in hopes to keep the sudden swell at bay. Simultaneously, he dried his clammy mits at his sides.

Carter exhaled the remaining residue of fear from his body. His hands began the seemingly mile-long journey across the generic plastic table, that separated him from his legacy. He softly enveloped the delicate, and colorfully manicured, fingers of his daughter’s right hand. He cleared his throat again, with the stuttered clatter of an orchestra conductor. The symphony of emotions within him were ready to begin their heartfelt melody. His head rose to find his daughter’s countenance, receptive and attentive.

The words fought for stability on Carter’s tongue, like towering monoliths wavering to the earthquaking forces of nature. He held onto them though, through the vise-like grip of his teeth, not letting the words fall and crumble away. Small streams were building to a teary waterfall in his eyes. The words were pushed to the very edge of his mouth, ready to freefall into the depths of his daughter’s heart.

“Elena… Elena I -- I’m SORRY,” Carter voiced with unfathomable sincerity. Heavy tears began to drop from his lids, like a refreshing summer rain, saturating his state jumper. Elena’s own misting eyes gave way, and pushed forth a flood of biblical proportions. Raging torrents were rushing down the lovely contours of her face, and dotting her dress with the abstract symbols of relief and forgiveness.

It was finally finished.

Now, they could start…
