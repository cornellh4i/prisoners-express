**Life’s Purpose By Daniel Montaño**

****Life's purpose as I see it is to persevere. I don’t mean just to survive, but to thrive. I don’t mean to thrive in a materialistic way, but if that is part of the fruits then by all means enjoy. What I mean to thrive, in the way we were created to thrive, by being created in the image of God. This image is not a physical nature, but in our being, our essence, our hearts condition, which should manifest itself in our thoughts, emotions, how we see the world, how we see others. The image of God is within our hearts.

With that said, there is humanity’s sin through Adam and Eve for which since, sin has been poured into our bodies and into this world. We are all born with a disability, our sinful nature, which of course handicaps us in this world.

We have come this far, the divide is so deep from the beings we were created to be that we can’t even fathom the idea of such pure unadulterated faith where the size of a mustard seed can move a mountain.

With this divide in mind is where I see life’s purpose, to persevere besides our weaknesses. Taking steps to close that divide, every step being love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self control. You will be pushed back, but you persevere, pick yourself up and continue taking those steps. At times you will crawl, take baby steps, other times you will have those big confident strides, even run. That divide will get smaller, you just do your best and God will do the rest.
