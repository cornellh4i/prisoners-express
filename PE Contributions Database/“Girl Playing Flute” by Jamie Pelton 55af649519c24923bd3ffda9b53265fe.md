**“Girl Playing Flute” by Jamie Pelton**

My hands are sweaty as I look at the picture that got me through many harsh times. I was eleven when I took the picture of little Suzie playing her flute. Suzie was 10 and her music always soothed me in my times of sorrow.

The day I took that picture was so long ago. We were at our special place. It was just a small grove of trees on the edge of town.

As I look at her picture I see the peace she has while she shuts her eyes.

I asked her that day why she shut her eyes while playing the flute. She said she shut her eyes, so she could shut out the ugliness of the harsh world we lived in.

I have looked at this picture so many times these past several years. Stuck in this prison for so long for someone else’s crime.

The picture captured the essence of Suzie’s soothing presence.

The day I took that picture Suzie knew I needed her music to get through rough times. My sister Jenny just died, I was told in school. She whispered to me “meet me at our special place. I will play a song for you.”

Throughout all my life the memory of that day, and her calming song helped me through hard times.

In the picture you can see that Suzie is at peace, and it calms me.

I still remember the day the judge sentenced me to 1,000 years in prison. I looked back at Suzie. “She shut her eyes, and simply said meet me at our special place.” Immediately I remembered that day, and her song got me through the sentencing.

Then I went to prison and had my first life and death situation. After the fight I hurried to call Suzie. When she answered the phone I was almost in tears. “Suzie,” I say. “I had no choice, and I almost killed them.” I explained that 2 guys came at me, and I had to defend myself or die. Suzie asked, “Do you still have it, John?” I said:

“Yeah I have the picture I took of you in our special place.” Suzie said,

“Close your eyes and meet me at our special place. I will play a song for you, John.” I grabbed the pictures and studied them for a brief moment. I remembered that day so vividly in my mind. I realized that Suzie is at peace because she was calming me with her song. I closed my eyes and Suzie played her song on that flute over the phone. Once again we were at our special place.

Appeal after appeal was denied, and it always was the same. Suzie would simply ask,

“Do you still have it John?” I would reply,

“Of course I do Suzie. You know I need you and our special place to get through it.” She would play that song, and all the roughness of a cruel world would melt away.

Then one day I received a letter in the mail from Suzie. It simply said, “Call me and John. You are going to marry me in our special place.” I raced to the phone, and my heart was pounding. What was Suzie talking about, I thought? It had been 30 years now since I was arrested.

I called Suzie, and she answered the phone. I asked Suzie, “How can I marry you in our special place? I am still in prison, and all the appeals have been denied.”

Then I heard her flute and that song that calmed me for so many years. When Suzie is finished with her song she speaks:

“John, I found the gas station you were in. The one three states away. John, the gas station owner saved the film, and we have you on camera three states away at the time the crime was taking place.”

That call was 6 months ago. Now we are at our special place, and we are about to be married. I put the picture in my pocket.

Suzie looks at me and shuts her eyes. She plays her song, and all the sorrows of yesterday melt away. We then are married!
