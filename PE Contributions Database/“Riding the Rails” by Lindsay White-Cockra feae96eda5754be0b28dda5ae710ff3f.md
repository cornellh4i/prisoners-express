**“Riding the Rails” by Lindsay White-Cockran**

As a child, I grew up with tracks right out front of our house. It took a while to get used to sleeping through the conductors blowing the whistle because it was a Rural Railroad crossing without a crossing gate. So they were required to always blow their whistle. You get used to it though, and eventually can sleep right through the sound. But the sound and sight of the tracks used to make me think *one day I’m going to ride out on a track and never look back*. I felt back then as if I could go anywhere, do anything. Now to look at tracks I just want to take them back home. Back to simpler days, easier times. To the days of youth and innocence. To the days when anything was possible. Then I have to stop, rearrange my thoughts, and know that anything is still possible. Those same tracks, the ones inside my thoughts can still take me anywhere I want to go. Today just as much as 20 years ago, it’s time to ride the rails, and always blow the whistle.
