**Gratitude by Brian Anderson**	

As I reflect on the fractious unfolding of my turbulent life, I’ve come to understand that I’ve been unwittingly fortunate and blessed in a myriad of ways. I am alive and in good health; I have a vibrant and inquisitive mind, and at my core---I possess a hopeful spirit. But of a greater pertinence is the presence of a sage inner-voice that is insightful, intuitive, and resolute at speaking to the meandering part of me that flounders in the face of adversity. That same prescient inner-voice subtly imposes upon me the need to seek a moral compass and for the incessant development of my mental and spiritual faculties in the quest to achieve supreme enlightenment.

In hindsight, I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to my well-wishing inner-voice that I’ve rarely listened to throughout my normal, everyday life. In the past, whenever a sense of foreboding was present or when a vexing ordeal had manifested itself at an inopportune time, I imprudently chose to engage in detrimental behaviors and self-defeating rationalization that contributed mightily to my incarceration, and I ignored my higher functioning inner-voice.

Not listening to that inner-voice has resulted in me making a series of bad choices that resulted into a fifty-six-year sentence because of armed robberies that I had no business committing. I robbed myself of precious moments in life and squandered unrealized potential. One of the greatest of these losses has been the loss of family, either through disconnect or death.

On the rare occasions when I did take heed and listened to that inner-voice in a time of crisis, good things resulted from it. On several occasions, I’ve had a gun pointed directly at my head with only a few feet to spare -- and in those moments my intuitive inner-voice compelled me to take the appropriate actions that saved me from harm or death.

There have been times when my godly inner-voice protested vehemently against some course of criminal activity that I was either contemplating or engaging in, such as robbery or hurting people. That inmost protest prevented me from doing some truly evil acts and from losing my soul and sanity to a perpetual torment because of those evil acts.

I’ve also experienced periods of times when I was being extremely lackadaisical in my approach to life but in listening to that inner-voice, I felt the need and calling to be better and to do better. Over the past two decades I’ve earned my GED, gotten various accredited certificates, job trades, and a sense of self-pride.

So when I think about the word “gratitude,” I must be thankful to my conscientiously prescient inner-voice for being inexorably present and guiding me away from a fate that would have led to my demise or plunged me headfirst into a bottomless abyss in which my sanity would’ve been forever forfeited.

Even though I’m in prison and have suffered innumerable hardships, I thank my inner-voice for giving me this opportunity to experience life through a profoundly moralistic lens and to be more appreciative of the countless blessings that God has bestowed upon us all.
