**“Helping Hand”** by ****Dillon Gresham

Lost in a world of darkness, where evil surrounds everything, everyone needs a helping hand every once in a while. Try it out and you may like it. Offer someone a cup of coffee, a stamp to write to their family. Or if you got a cell phone, let someone less fortunate call their people. Someone who’s being extorted, oppressed, or bullied, lend a helping hand and intervene. If someone is going hungry, give them a soup. Is 60 cents really so bad if you know it’s not going towards drugs? Maybe someone can’t read. Give them a helping hand and read them their letter, or better yet, help them learn to read. If you spot someone who needs help understanding the law in a motion, does it hurt you to give a helping hand by explaining? Did God give you the ability or the fortune for these things to be wasted and cherished? Give a helping hand occasionally, it’ll make you feel better inside. You may come to like it. Just because we’re treated inhumane, does it make us less human?
