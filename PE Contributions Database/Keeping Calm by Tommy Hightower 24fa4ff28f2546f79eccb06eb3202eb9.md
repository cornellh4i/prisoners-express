**Keeping Calm by Tommy Hightower**

August’s word prompt “keeping calm,” immediately brings to mind an expression I have been hearing lately, “keep calm, and carry-on!” So let my pen today and brain say, “how do you keep calm, and carry-on” in today's divided citizenry.

I’m old enough to have learned hard lessons of why you should never allow someone on something to get your joat so angry, you spit out words before you taste them, which as physics dictates, your angry response to such provocation, shall mandatory, result in an equal or greater reaction in the party you say it to. Then come the law of inertia. In such a case as owns, we have reacted to provocation, by reacting with greater force, which shall meet the original forced words, each cause effects the exponential growth of rising inertia to a physical agitation-such chain reactions do always escalate from verbal to the physical. Let tell you a twism most murderers know, these physical laws, which start as mere thoughts and words, do exponentially grow into a rage which leads to deadly endings.

At least half of all violent crimes, began as mere words, thoughts, that lead to rising emotional responses-which ends violently.

Do “keep calm,” “carry on” with life. Never react until you carefully weigh what your reaction shall lead to. Read the newspapers. Everyday some very angry individual goes out spitting out insightful words at others in an effort to start a violent fight. If you are wse as King Solomon taught us all in the proverbs-you careful reflect, deflect, deescalate at every interaction. It takes two opposing forces to collide into chain reaction. When you keep calm. Smile. Even story silent-watch your free expression as body language to-let nothing hostile be expressed, you will find the agitator will move on-you refused to bite on the bait he/she spit out at you. That makes you a much better, happier person, who shall live a long, healthy, happy life.

Anger stresses body and soul, so practice staying calm. Do not allow your mind to focus on anger, but calm-prove yourself the strongest when you show complete control over your emotions and body language.

I will not advocate complete passivity. If you are attached physical before any words are exchanged, definitely defend yourself. But stay calm-use only enough force to defend. Do not exceed the violence your opponent expels. To do so will prolong a escalating confrontation here you both are jailed, hospitalized. By defense with only sufficient force to stop the attack-your opponent will quickly time of the conflict-and move on to a easier victim

I’m not King Solomon, but I’m well-read-ad well studied in conflicts. 23 years of prison, plus 20 years in a poverty sticker, crime riddled childhood neighborhood. I listen to older adults counted as a child-then watch, learn, listen- I quickly became a moderator of disputes by age 7 or 8, still am today. So I’m just a great grandfather sharing a life lesson to any humankind family.

May your lives all be blessed with peace, calm, parole.

God bless. Respectfully yours,

Tommy Hightower
