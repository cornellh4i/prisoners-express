**Rescued, Delivered, Saved by Benjamin Penny**

In foster care, my “parents,” Jerry the music pastor and Carol the prayer partner, attended Christain Faith Center (now Shoreline) in Austin, TX. The message was to give to the church and you’ll receive a “good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.”

At age 29, I had read many Christain books and tracts, bible studies, and attended various services. The same message. God wants to bless us with all the material things we can handle.

Yet the man they call Jesus said this:

“Store not up your treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy or a thief can break in and steal. Rather store up your treasure in Heaven”

“Go and sell all that you have, give to the poor, and come follow me.

Greatest commandment: “Love God with all your heart, soul and strength.

Christainity provided the Crusades that killed Christains, Muslims, and others. It sold entrance to Heaven by “indulgences.” (Roman Catholicism). Rome’s rebellious daughter churches enabled and supported slavery in America and Jim Crow. This same Christainity exists today; they are today’s Pharisees and Sadducees - rich, powerful, better than others, judgemental, and lost. In the End Times, Satan’s hallmark accomplishment is deceiving the whole world (Rev 12:9). How are 2 billion Christains not part of “the whole world’ when they are the “little flock” in Luke 12.

I studied Islam, Buddhism, Christainity (all forms), Jehovah’s Witnesses, and sexual debauchry. I vowed to “God” that when I found the truth I’d devote myself to it. Basically, “prove you are real and I’ll serve you.”

April, 2010. I discovered Herbert W. Armstrong who interpreted Bible prophecy from 1932 to his death in 1986. Accurately. Very specifically too (not cryptically general). They began to fall in place in 1989 and continue today - worldwide. I looked at his doctrines.

The Way is founded on the Law (Torah), and framed by the Prophets (Acts 24:14). The Laws define what sin is (Romans 7:7-1 John 3:4). The New Covenant is based on the Law (Hebrews 8:8-12; Jeremiah 31:31-34) being written on our heart and in our mind. “Jesus” came to fulfill (pleroo) the Law which fills it up and makes it more strict (Matthew 5:17, 21-28), because we are judged by our love, not just actions. This is confirmed in Romans 13:10, “love is the fulfilling (pleroma - what fills) the Law. The cornerstone is Sabbath: established at creation, given before 10 Commandments (Exodus 16), confirmed for today (Hebrews 4:1 - 10, esp 9) and required by Gentile converts (Acts 15:21). John, the Apostle “Jesus” loved, said “he who does not obey the Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him (1 John 2:4) an dthat to love “God” we shall keep His Commandments that are NOT burdensome (5:3).

In 1981, Armstrong tasked his church’s top leaders to research the Hebrew, personal name of “God.” They found Yahweh. Today, our leaders tell us we cannot know this for certain. A lie. Yahweh predicted that prophets of lies would cause His people to forget His name for Ba’al (Lord) in Jeremiah 23:27.

“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12). Our Savior’s name is very important. YHWShA is the Hebrew spelling. Y’hushua (stress the shua) is the pronunciation. It literally translates as Yahweh is the Deliverer. Delivered, saved, or Rescued.
