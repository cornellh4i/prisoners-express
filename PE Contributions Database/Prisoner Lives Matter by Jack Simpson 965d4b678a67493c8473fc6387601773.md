**Prisoner Lives Matter by Jack Simpson**

Over the three decades and still inmates and to include staff, can't wait to take lives of others. so many times over the years the perimeter lights have shown  bright during mid-day. this pause the voltage down to reduce the wattage needed to electrocute a person. Some claim to be innocent, while the rest embrace the fact their life is soon over.

I’ve have kept up with the ongoing violence on the streets. In a little different way it is safer here than on the street. The staff really don’t have a problem cracking heads. In the streets as I see from TV. People cry out “my rights!” They violated my rights. Here we give up most of our rights we are sentenced.

Prisoners lives matter to our family, friends, and to some of the people who work here. One question I had asked an officer years ago and he did not hesitate to answer:

“What is the price of a human life to you if a prisoner climbed the fence?” He remarks, “The price of a double shotgun shell.” Then he circled his chest to display the projected area. Better known as kill patton. For less than a U.S. One dollar bill, is what a prisoner’s life is worth to some that work here…

I believe that after being here, there are some people who would be better off in a controlled environment. A large group of people deserve a second chance at life.

Life is too short for people in prison and the public to waste away. COVID-19 took a lot of people’s lives. Two really good friends of mine are now gone. In two weeks, they were gone.

I believe that all lives matter. No matter if you are Black, White, Green Yellow, or any not mentioned. We all bleed the same color, red. Most of all we have are feelings and we are living human beings.

It is the way a person handles their serves. To be involved in a group that is set to destroy any other because of the color of their skin or that your views are different than mine.

Just like the late Roddney King quoted, ”Can’t we all just get along!” Also to include another great man, Dr. Martin Lurther King said “I have a dream… that we all will be one nation and one people”.

It is my dream that we all can live in peace and to see that prisoner lives matter. That every human life is worth living to the end. Not to be cut short because on feels superior to the other

I can only ask one question to all who read this short story: what is your life worth? How would you rate their life or they rate your life?
