**“Arguments” by Phillip Rath**

“Arguments” a word with negative connotations, especially for children.

“Don’t argue with one,” spoken to a child by a parent or other adult authority figure, sends the message to the child to never argue with authority. Is that the message we really want our children to accept as a rule etched in stone? Isn’t this the perfect opening for a child molestor to use to groom a child into victim hood? I sure hope not!

What does the “DON’t ARGUE WITH ME,” statement say about the adult/authority figure? Are they so insecure in themselves that they are unable to face a questioning of their authority? Are they unqualified for their position of authority? Are they abusing their authoritative power? Think on these things.

Encourage argument in a civil manner. It will provide an excellent avenue of learning for all those involved.
