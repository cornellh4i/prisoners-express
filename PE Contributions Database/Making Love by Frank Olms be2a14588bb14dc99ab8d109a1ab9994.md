**Making Love by Frank Olms**

Sometimes making love is the gift from God and timing is everything.

I was driving along Main Street: downtown. The time was about seven at night. As I passed the Bradstreet grammar school, I saw the love of my life.

Many times you see a member of the opposite sex and have immediate paroxyms of passion that leave as quickly as they came-but not tonight. I pulled over to the curb and parked my car.

She was sitting on the front steps of the school, about 100 feet from the street, her chin resting in her hands, and her elbows supported by her knees. (what was I seeing?) Some supernatural force was bringing us together. She was just fifteen. The date was August 8, 1962.

The initial conversation was awkward and somewhat one-sided as she seemed to be taken by surprise. We made arrangements to meet again- the next night.

She told me later, that night she called the fella she had just started to date and told him they would still be friends but would no longer go out together that was all she told me then.

Four years later we were married (what therefore God had joined together, let no man put asunder).

Our life together was typical of most: struggle, adjust, struggle some more, accept and move on. We had good times, we had hard times, but we never had BAD times.

Our first child (my wife referred to her as our love child) came along and was followed by three more. Two girls and two boys. And she gave them all equal love.

We attended a year end party for the Englewood Board of Realtors in 2002. A few days later, at the board office, another Realtor asked me who the girl was that I was with at the party, and I said, “my wife”. He then asked if we had just gotten married. I asked him why he thought that. He said, “Because you two look like you just met each other.” I said “we did- forty years ago”.

I guess true love never flaunts itself-it just shows.

Three years later, during 2005, forty three years after we met, my wife died. On her death bed she told her two friends how we met and that she knew that night that I would be the one she would spend the rest of her life with… How would she know that… she was only fifteen. A marriage made in Heaven? Maybe-

Me?... I’m still making love in my mind
