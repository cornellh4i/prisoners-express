**Stone Soup by Catherine Lafleur**

When I was child, living in the commune, I had a book, *Stone Soup.* It told the story of a village suffering a famine. The old lady heroine decided to take her pot to the communal cook fire and prepare Stone Soup for all her starving neighbors. She began by putting a large stone in the pot and filling it with water.

One by one the people would pass by.  “What are you doing?'' they asked.

The woman replied,” cooking stone soup for the whole village. Would you like to add anything? Anything no matter how small.”  Each villager would put in something small: onions, cabbage. beets, and egg, some chicken, until the soup smelled amazing. Finally the soup was done and there was so much each villager was able to have a second serving.

Covid 19 has hit Camp Prisoney Land like a tidal wave. No one was prepared with a stock of supplies. Hundreds are infected and the entire prison is on quarantine forced to wear face masks. Even the culinary services dorm is shit down. And so all our food is being prepared by random novices who know nothing about food prep.

The breakfast often doesn’t come until lunchtime and one evening we had supper at 11pm after master roster count. Earlier in the year, I made a change to the Religious Diet Program for health reasons. Essentially it consists of raw veggies: cabbage, assorted beans, cherry tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, etc. I also get packaged fish and fresh fruit. Because of restrictions I cannot buy many things in the canteen such as Ramen noodles, sausages, other sundry unclean foods, etc.

Enter my friend, HoneyBee, famous in these parts for her excellent peanut brittle and also for her apple cobblers which she wrests from the microwaves at recreation. Both of us tested positive for Corona, so we stayed put in good old Delta Dorm now plague ridden. She has a locker full of edible odd bits. Early on I presented her with my giant sized both and the contents of my RDP bags. HoneyBee has been turning out delicious regouts twice a day for lunch and supper for four weeks. Sometimes it’s a seafood pasta dish. Other times, it’s a bean and veggie medley salad. One time she made delicious lemon pepper tuna sandwiches with a chopped tomato and cucumber mix on wheat bread.

And so my friend and I are sharing our own version of stone soup.
