"Big City" **by John Naylor**

I remember my first sleepover in the big city. It was in Indianapolis, Indiana. Mom told us about a homeschooler’s conference at the convention center. We were going to get a room at “The Western”, downtown. I had never heard of it at church or on TV, but it was supposed to be a real nice hotel. The trip was longer to my anticipation than it truly was. Maman drove and she was taught to drive by her Dad so that a glass of water wouldn’t fall over if left on the floorboard. Mom sat to her right with my brother, Andy, and I in the rear.

We got to one part of the city I remembered from before. It always smelled like sauerkraut or something. No one has ever been able to explain to me why it smells that way. But we all discussed it. On the ‘83, Buick LeSabre whined.

The hotel reminded me of the fancy ones in the movies. They had ashtrays with a fancy “W” stamped in the sand. Which meant they were paying someone to - like a cat scooper - replace sand and stamp a “W”. There were quite a few of them, but I didn’t see a lot of smokers. I wondered how much it took to maintain all these ashtrays. It may have been the majority of someone’s job for a day. There could’ve been a smoker with a fedora and a trench coat, his collar turned up like a cartoon spy from somewhere. In the ancient game of cat and mouse, he could’ve been messing up all the nice ashtrays with cigarette butts, just peering around corners, waiting to make someone’s life hell. After all, those spies existed somewhere to give the cartoonists the idea, so why not a hotel that looked like it was out of a movie?

The elevator dinged. We were ready to go up now. I thought of all kinds of things in the silence of the elevator ride. Would there be little mints? Or are they only for looks? If you don’t eat them are they recycled for the next guest? How many chocolates and mini bar items get pilfered? With what people say they charge it must be a lot. We were happy with the room, especially since it had pay per view. That meant Andy and I were maybe able to catch some new releases without Mom screening them first, which meant she couldn’t say no. That is, unless it got real graphic or obscene or whatever.

There were all kinds of neat stuff at that homeschooler’s conference, but some things not so neat from a student’s perspective. Good and bad, you’d come home with a little of it all. Andy and I got a bow and some arrows a family made, good. But Mom picked up a cheesy tape of multiplication tables set to cheesy music we’d grow to hate. It wouldn’t help you remember, just drive you nuts. Kevin Stonerock was there. He was a lawyer and musician who performed and recorded old songs from America’s past. He dressed up in period-correct clothes. He was nice and shook our hands. I wonder if he’s still around doing it somewhere. I bet he never thought there’d be a prisoner singing his songs in maximum security cells and shower cells in jails and prisons. With the crowd there I wouldn’t have guessed it either. And I was the singer, I still nearly can’t believe it.

But on the way to the hotel that evening, something unbelievable happened. A golf cart full of people was going way too fast and ran over my foot. I had trouble walking on it. The driver profusely apologized, but it was a little late for good intentions.

That night we saw “The Pelican Brief” on pay per view. One of the handguns reminded me of a pellet pistol I’d seen, was it a beeman? I wanted it; now it was like some spy stuff. We were all shocked to hear Walter Brimley swear like he did, the face of wholesome oatmeal tainted, our mouths agape. And that poor lean Tom Cruise. Being chased by a big bad man for trying to do a good thing. We rooted for Tom, while we wanted to say “Shame on you Walter”.

We eventually got to sleep and had a room service experience for the last time. They had some good pancakes and fruit. Somewhere, I know Andy still has one of those little empty syrup bottles. Not even a golf cart could ruin this boy’s first sleepover in the big city. And the best news was that I had no broken bones in my right foot. I have always been a fan of milk.
