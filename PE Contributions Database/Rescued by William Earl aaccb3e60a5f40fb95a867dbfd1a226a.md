I was sitting in the chow hall eating yet another of the unappetizing meals that TDCJ is known to serve; actually I was scarfing the meal down because I was so hungry. That was when one of the other men at the table made the comment, “Man, you must have been rescued by prison.” His comment drew the desired laughter that such a comment is designed to evoke from our fellow dining companions.

The comment was not in regard to the fact that i was eating chow, but instead directed at the fact that i was eating everything on my tray with gusto. I am not one of the blessed ones who have family or friends that place money on my books, therefore I am not able to make commissary every spending period. In order to receive the nourishment that my body needs, I have to eat what is provided to me by the state of Texas, whether they are tasty or not.

The point of this article is not to criticize the dietary conditions in TDCJ - although they are in dire need of being criticized - nor is it an attempt to gain pity for my indigent status. The point of this article is to demonstrate the truth of the comment of my dining companion that day; although in completely different ways than he intended.

Rescued. The word evokes images of someone or something of value being saved from a hazardous situation. When i saw that rescued was the theme for this month, i immediately thought of a young child being rescued from a burning building by a courageous fireman. I almost wrote a fictional story based upon that very scenario, but that is when I realized that I had indeed been rescued and I have my own story of being salvaged from destruction to share.

My dining companion was attempting to equate my being hungry in prison with my being homeless or jobless, or both, in the free world. When in actuality nothing could have been further from the truth. I was gainfully employed and had a decent place to live. However, my life was very much rescued by coming to prison.

While I was still out in what is commonly called the “free world” by those of us who are incarcerated, I was a functioning alcoholic and drug addict. The sole reason that I had and kept a job was so I would have money to purchase alcohol and drugs. The fact that I was able to function in society was simply because I had not yet reached the low point in my addiction. That point where every waking moment is spent in pursuit of the next drink, the next line of cocaine or the next shot of methamphetamine.

I am totally convinced that if I had not been arrested and come to prison when I did, I would have died in my addiction. I was headed to an early grave only to receive a reprieve from this certain death sentence by of all things, prison.

Comprehension does not come immediately to those of us who have been heavily involved with drugs. I was not immediately aware that being confined inside a prison was what would eventually become my liberation. I no longer have the urge or desire to drink or do drugs. I now realize that exactly how much those years of drug abuse has ended up costing me.

That absence of family and friends that I mentioned earlier in this article is just part of the high price of living high. I know that I was not the best brother or friend that I could have been while I was out there. All of the lies and all of the denials have taken their toll even on those who loved me the most. More than twenty years inside, and they are still waiting for the slip that they are sure will come. It seems realization also comes slowly to those who have heard it, and seen it all, too many times before.

I have since been rescued once again during my incarceration here in prison. On November 12, 2012, I fell to my knees inside my one man cell and cried out to God. I told God that I was not sure if He remembered me or not, there were many times that I was convinced He had completely turned his back on me, but was there any way that He could find it within Himself to forgive me for all the things that I had done in my life that was contrary to his holy standard? I told him that I know Jesus is the Son of God, and that he Died on the cross to pay the penalty for my sin. I told him that I had attempted to run my life 45 years, and the only thing I had been able to accomplish in that time was to get a life sentence and 262 months in federal prison on top of that. I gave him control of my life and asked Jesus Christ to come into my life to be my Savior. I discovered that it wasn’t God who had turned His back on me; but it was I who had shunned him.

Yes, my dining companion that day was absolutely correct. Prison has indeed rescued me, and in so many more ways than he could have ever known on that day in the chow hall.

Rescued.
