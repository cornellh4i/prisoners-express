**“Wicked Games” by Catherine Lafleur**

Dear Gentle Readers:

Here at Camp Prisoney Land, there are many wicked games people play. These games are played in doubles or as team sports without any protective gear. They can involve inmates with other inmates, inmates with non-inmates, or non-inmates with other non-inmates. In my state, Prisoney Land is so notorious regarding wicked games that this problem became a plot point in the James Patterson novel Now You See Her.

**Baby Mama Drama** - Have you heard the old adage “don’t play where you work”? No one pays attention to this rule in Prisoney Land. The local police had to be called to break up a MMA match between two mid-level female non-inmates who were ripping each other’s weave out in the parking lot, brawling and throwing each other into staff cars over possession of a male mid-level non-inmate. He eventually got traded to a federal team and the women got fired.

**Mop Closet Bingo** - Everything happens in the mop closet, whether in fiction or real life. You practically have to have a reservation these days. Contestants enter the closet in porn combinations in doubles or as many as quadruples. The door is shut and no one comes out for twenty minutes. The exception is one particular jack rabbit who managed to finish the round in eight minutes. He was on the local news channel with a mug shot. Arrested! *Gasp*. Did this man learn nothing from Bill and Monica and the stained blue dress? Remember, gentle readers, you’ll never wipe away all the evidence and you should at least retrieve the towel afterwards.

**The Bachelor(rette)** - Not to say that wicked games involve only male non-inmates. Sometimes these matches last long beyond the prison experience. Now you can marry whomever you want including the inmate of your choice. Of course you can’t work here after the marriage. Most couples wait until the End of the Road. In a touching scene worthy of the most torrid romance novel scenes, the inmate is decanted from the prison into the waiting arms of the non-inmate partner. But it’s probably a good idea not to try and place your bachelor(ette)’s phone number on you approved phone list or to list their residence as your future residence when filling out paperwork with your classification officer.

**Why Does the Mona Lisa Smile?** - So there you are in the Louvre waiting to see the most famous of all famous portraits. You stand in an endless line sometimes for years. While you are waiting, you actually forget what the Mona Lisa looks like. You question yourself. When was the last time I saw her? Will you recognize this portrait when you see it again? You try and gauge how long the line is until the two people in front of you spring apart unexpectedly, like when you innocently open a cell door to deliver clean laundry and two parties unexpectedly pull apart and face you. And there it is. Obviously a masterpiece, each detail stunningly correct. Except. Except. Why is it so small? This is what I’ve been waiting for? And the Mona Lisa smiles as if to say “gotcha!”.

**Tennis** - This game is played in singles at all hours in many locations: cells, the shower, the actual tennis court, and the recreation yard in front of dozens of interested observers. Rather pedestrian in terms of the other exotic sporting opportunities. If you are caught making unauthorized physical contact, you may be forced to the penalty box and given a time out for 60 days and end up with a 9/7 report in your jacket.

**Auditioning the Finger Puppets at Midnight** - Don’t like team sports? Afraid of the many unpleasant diseases that are spread in the protectionless environment of Prisoney Land? There are more solitary pursuits. You too can be the director interviewing the star or starlet of your choice in your own private director’s couch. Best to do this late at night and at timed intervals when non-inmates are making their rounds and checking their rosters twice to find out who is naughty and who is nice. Develop excellent hearing. Unfortunately, you may be charged with a sexual violation - a 9/7 disciplinary report for unauthorized sexual contact with yourself. The penalty flag will be thrown and you’ll be in the SHU for 60 days. Fortunately, there are so many players of tennis that you won’t spend the full time out in the corner.

I remain your faithful correspondent.
