**“Prison Fly-Boys” by Michael Lanning**

****Quiet! Quiet please! Thank y’all fo’ coming to the first meetin’ of AAAACK. We be the Afrikan-Amerikan Allegiance Against Cracker Klanzmen. We y’all come together ‘cuz Warden Cracker-man wants one of us to fly hiz whoopty-whoop aero-plane.

So letz go round and say a little something-something why we should not fly cracker-man’s whoopty-whoop aero-plane.

“Yeah, ah, my name is Goldie. I have ah, a, a, a, a gold chain addiction. I almost died from an ah, gold chain overdose. I don’t fly ‘cuz my gold chains be too heavy to fly.”

Okay Goldie, have a seat. Next guy.

“Yeah, my name is Khamando Joe. I like cutting off the heads of G.I. Joes and putting them in the fridge where the eggs go. Every time I open the fridge I see twelve G.I. Joes staring at me. I feed Barbie to my dog. I kill the fool who…”

OK, OK, Joe. That’s special. Calm down, take a seat. Letz hear from the next person. Yesss...ma’am? Or man? You are?

“Hi, I’m Venus. I want to say to y’all you fly-boys who are on the down-low coming to my cell at all hours try’n’ to get some. You hood-rats done bumped your head. Y’all don’t have ‘nough bling-bling or ice cream to satizfy this grrrl.”

“X-kooz me! X-kooz me! I’m father Phondle. Um, I, ah, sister Venus, I think if y’all come to my cell, I got some, uh, candy for y’all. Oh yeah, and uh, I can lay my hands on you while puttin’ the word of, um, God in you. These fly-boys leave you ‘lone once they see father Phondle taken you under hiz parish. We be prayin’ and livin’ large, savin’ you. Yeah, that’s what I do. I be savin’ you.”

OK, father Phondle, Mr. Venus, that’s something you need to get together privately OK. Not something to deal with here. Y’all know what I mean. Y’all pickin-up what I’m puttin’ down? What we’re try’n’ to do here is find one of you to fly cracker-man’s whoopty-whoop aero-plane. Can anyone do that? Does anyone know how to fly?

“Yo man! Hey! Yeah, I fly. I never leave the cell, but I fly so high no one can catch me. I get some heroin I fly all over the planet, man. You want me flyin’. Get me some heroin and I show you flyin’.”

Alright now. Well, this ends our first meetin’ of AAAACK.
