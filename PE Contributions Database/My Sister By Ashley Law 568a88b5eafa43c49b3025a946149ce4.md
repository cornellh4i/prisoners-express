**My Sister: By Ashley Law**

When I think about sisters, I think about laying in bed and talking and talking while listening to music. Telling each other about secrets and things we wanted to do. Then, at 16, being wild and selfish as my sister cried and begged me not to go, but I left in the middle of the night. Ran away from home and nothing has been the same since. That closeness I had with my baby sister has been lost and I yearn to have that bond back. In 2008, my sister got pregnant and I tried to be there, yet because of disagreements with my mom, I left again, also missing her wedding in 2009. Not much of a sister at all. Yet there’s my sister still waiting for me to be her big sis again. She waits as I sit out a second prison sentence. I move in and choose, once again to leave. Always leaving. How am I supposed to build a bond with her if all I do is stay absent? I miss another pregnancy… back to prison, I go and my sister is there, just wanting me to get my life together. She tells me “next time, I’m not letting you leave and screw up”. Does she feel like she could have done more? That she has failed me in some way? This thought hurts my heart, none of this is her fault. As the past 7 ½ years have gone by, my sister seems further and further away and I blame myself. I know she has a life. Reality hits me at our visit a few weeks ago when she tells me she hasn’t opened my last letter… Will I ever get that sister bond back that I want so badly? I feel like I don’t know her anymore. 16 years have gone by since we were girls whispering in the dark until we fell asleep and if it takes me 16 more years to get my sister back, I’ll do whatever it takes. I love you Savannah!
