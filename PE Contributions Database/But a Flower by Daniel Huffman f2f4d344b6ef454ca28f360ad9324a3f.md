**But a Flower by Daniel Huffman**

I know I’m but a flower to you child,

But please don’t pick me, be fair

Yes it’s true I grew wild

And I see my friends in your hair

I’m begging and pleading, I’m being polite

Let me see another day

So sweet my smell in the air tonight

But won’t you be on your way
