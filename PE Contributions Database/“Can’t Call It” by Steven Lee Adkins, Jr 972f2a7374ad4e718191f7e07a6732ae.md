**“Can’t Call It” by Steven Lee Adkins, Jr.**

****The stars are whatever you want them to be--whatever the imagination renders from their cerebral depths, the same depths from which our ancestors concluded and taught to us. In every culture, what humanity teaches in every location on earth isn’t necessarily true. What has been believed, taught, enforced, fought over, and/or died for are all the fruits of thought. They are simply opinions, some true some not. Some sustain the journey of time, and some are tested, found false, and re-established in another form.

Just as on this very ground we walk, there are entities that defy our capabilities and mental capacities. The bumble bee and their small wings are great examples. Or the monarch butterfly and how it can navigate its return of the land of its ancestors from many generations ago. Both are simple, and yet our description and analyses of them are guesses to the best of our knowledge. A de facto, you could say. We venture out and bring back the world to share, influenced by millions of encounters and experiences.

If there are small creatures that we can touch or hold defy us, who can say what the stars are? Depths of water, darkened earth and even that which comes into contact with our air remains unexplained. Several scientists or other respected professionals will analytically dissect each mystery with ruthless efficiency, pushing the limits of the human mind, and often disagree with one another.

One will have a theory will a colleague has that theory, each equally persuasive yet equally cancelling out the other. Competition and controversy reign supreme; contempt and confusion foul the perpetual battle. I am confident and even audacious, but explaining things millions of miles away when men and women better than me have failed to explain completely what is within our own plain of existence would be arrogant and false. What are the stars? Use your imagination, because I can’t call it.
