**“Exploited!” by Terry Lytle**

Am I not, my brother’s keeper? Our chains say it’s so. Not a bum, wino, goat or lamb in the street...not even used wrappers, or trash, to rifle through for something to eat! What are, shadows, but proof: bigger buildings exist; yet, here we stand-EXPLOITED!-something like a picture on a sicko’s list...with not one gorilla in our midst!

Faces covered; hair long-NO!- that’s not, “that position”-it’s from being shackled so long...standing, with my eyes blind. And, that’s my brother-beat my back first!!! He wears an athletic supporter...Just as all the windows have bars, a man-child wants to be identified, as to who we are...You’ve got to be CRAZY!, chaining us, so with grown-man boots on our feet! I don’t think this is Africa...this street. Maybe it’s one those Commie-bastard country’s, that turn the other cheek...when it comes to exploited children, chained up in the street.

These chains serve no purpose! We can’t run, in these big-ass boots on our feet! Where’s the crowds?! The mothers?! The police??!! Exploited, 2019...our hero, a writer with a pen...as these terrorists are gonna get tamed by the terror that he brings. Going off!, harder than a car-bomb in Iraq-where’s that camera man at??!!

No amount of money, justifies such a “scene”...sickos, and pedophiles creep among our community, our pages...released back into our streets! Since when did a picture theme assignment, become so grim??!! Miss me, with the next one-I’M NOT THEM! Suffering, little children...not even life in prison, could become so dim...with chains that tight. Dear ink-pen, kite the paper with your LIGHT...
