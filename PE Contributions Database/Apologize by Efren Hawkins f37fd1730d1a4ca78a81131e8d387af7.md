**“Apologize” by Efren Hawkins**

As I reflect on all the wrong I’ve done I owe plenty more apologies. That’s why I’m thankful to those that have forgiven me. When I was in the street, I was “Bout It.” Today, I’m on a whole new level, I’m now acting upon how I was raised. So, I “Thank” my mother and I apologize too, because I was brought better than this. My biggest apologies are to my kids and grandkids. I just met a daughter I never knew about a few months ago and she’s 26 years old.

I’m gonna be honest. I apologize because I didn’t know how to be a father until I turned 40 years old. This was the same time I became true to Islam. My greatest and most faith filled is to Allah, and my gratitude is to Allah for giving me the knowledge and wisdom to show me I need to give these sincere apologies. Today I know I’ll be apologizing even in my grave.

I even had to apologize to my left arm (smile). I got a tattoo with the words, “God Forgive, I Don’t” inked into my skin. What was I thinking about. I could blame it on being high, “Ha,” I was mad at the world at the time. In the end though, I could only blame myself.

I apologize for the darkness I brought into countless people's lives. I dishout my apologies and try to bring light and understanding into people’s lives. As I sit here writing, I’m under a veil because I just transferred to a camp that I left under some unexplainable circumstances. I’ve been here a week and they are just starting to recognize who I am. I’ve got to laugh from some of the statements I’ve heard. “Oh boy, that’s Hawk, it’s going down digital. He ain’t got no love.” I apologize for giving anyone a reason to have that thought in their mindset. I try to explain that I’m telling a job. Today I’m guided by Allah and I seek refuge from myself in Allah. “I’M SORRY!!”
