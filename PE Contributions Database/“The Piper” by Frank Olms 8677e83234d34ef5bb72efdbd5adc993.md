**“The Piper” by Frank Olms**

It was one of those picture perfect days. Just perfect for the day hike we planned weeks earlier. The sun rose and cleared the horizon leaving in its wake the kaleidoscope of colors that accompany the sun’s rise.

The sun was now warming the morning air as the dew of the evening and light fog also become a memory as we shouldered our day packs to begin the few miles of trail that led to the edge of a secluded pond which had for an apron a wide flat meadow.

The air was dry and the temperature was extremely compatible with use both; the type of day that some always talk about, look forward to, dream of, but in reality... never experience, and live to tell others of.

Light cirrus clouds drifted aimlessly across the sky, motivated by the unseen but ever present wings of the wind. Yes on the wings of the wind. The wind that also carries the birds in their seemingly erratic flights as they flit about from place to place, branch to branch; no obvious discernible destination.

But today there was something more in the wind.

The birds were aware of the addition to their environment, as they chirped – sometimes slowly and sometimes vociferously – as they cocked their heads to hear and try to see where the strange occurrence was emanating from.

As we hiked along the seldom used trail, the birds flew along side as if guiding us to our desired haven, although, we thought, it was unknown to them.

There became apparent to us a faint sound. The eerie subtle sound of an Aeolian harp as sometimes played by the wind as it moves through the trees of the forest, but there was no such wind this day.

As we walked along the trail our Spirits were crying for leaving. I looked behind at the trail. It was closing in behind us.

The sound was getting louder by gentle increments of decibels, and the wind began to whisper as the sound became familiar. It was the sound of a wind pipe: a flute. The Piper was leading us on.

The birds flew in formation toward the Piper who was ‘leading us to reason’. All the trees of the woods began to rejoice before the Lord.

The trail back was now gone, there was now way out, and the wind began to whisper, “Come... Come…”

‘Our heads were humming and it won’t go, ‘cause we don’t know, the Piper’s calling to join –’

As we approached the edge of the meadow, the joyful notes from the pipe gave quietus to our souls and the pipe pointed to the west, and the whispering wind became visible.

The birds chirped with glee as they led the way across the meadow, and we followed the sound of the Piper, and ‘the forest would echo with laughter’.

We moved across the meadow – our feet not touching the ground – toward the whispering wind, and ‘there walks a lady we all know who shines white light and wants to show’ – that we’re all buying a stairway to Heaven.
