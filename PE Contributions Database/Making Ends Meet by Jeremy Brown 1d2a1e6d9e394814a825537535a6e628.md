**Making Ends Meet by Jeremy Brown**

“When you make two ends meet it becomes complete!”

I serve people in various ways. By helping and serving others with my talents, words, abilties, wisdom, and knowledge, I’m able to make ends meet. For instance, have you ever wondered about all the strands of DNA in your body. If you were to make those ends meet it would be 6ft long. Of course, you would have to pull the DNA out of the nuclei  of 1 trillion plus cells and use nano-claws to hold the strands together from end point to starting point.

As for surviving in prison? Well that’s easy if you just go to chow, come back, and meditate on your bunk all day, but that’s boring and creates apathy and stagnation. I educate people, I change mind frequencies. I teach yoga, sometimes I’m known for reading Tarot or palms, law work (no prob, easy peasy). If I’m feeling creative myself maybe I’ll do a tattoo on myself or other people. I write and sell poetry, mostly love poetry for people’s girls, or boys of whatever they’re into. The other day I sold my shower time for $1.00.

Making ends meet is about fulfilling another person’s needs, wants, desires, or just stringing together 1 trillion cells of deoxyribonucleic acids. I make it look easy, and it all is once you get your Universal Flow, you sort of just go. I focus intently on what it is I’m doing and just keep going. Work is work, it doesn’t matter what I’m doing, I do it. I have 7 people who owe me Digital Cred, money, food items, for various tasks performed, and half of them will never pay, oh but favors in the future come in handy (eww so dandy!).

I make more than ends meet, I make Beginnings separate, I change fate, and I manifest destiny with every thought, word, deed, action, point of view. You must find all the ends to make them meet, once they meet, separate the ends, make new friends and make their ends meet. Do you feel the Universal Music Beat? Hee hee :) Trying to make ends meet, you’re a slave to money than you dre[am].
