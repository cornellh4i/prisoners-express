**Debts by James Stevahn**

There’s debts I can pay with cash, debit cards, and autopay. Then there’s debts you can’t. Many Americans have paid this debt, but you won’t find it in their bank statements. I’m talking about the combination of debts. If you’ve ever been locked up you know these debts.

I owe my two children a debt of almost twenty years out of their lives. I hate to truly owe this debt.

To my parents I owe a debt of the embarrassment and disappointment of having their oldest child to be incarcerated, A sorry cannot cover it.

I owe a brother debt to my two younger brothers and sister. This is not the example I wanted to show them.

To my friends I owe a debt of friendship. They were honest and sincere until I racked up this debt, and now they’re gone.

To the judicial system I owe a debt of two hundred and thirty-nine months of my life. A debt that takes some time to repay. However, when it’s done on paper at least it’s marked paid.

To my Lord. I’ve shamed you for my transgressions. I pray everyday to be reconciled with you.

Then there’s the debts that will never be balanced. The first is to the victims of my crimes. I’ve forever altered your life and not in a positive way. I know forgiveness is a hard hard thing to give. I let you down when I should have lifted you up and protected you. I am truly forever sorry.

The second debt is to myself. I owe a life debt here. I’ve ruined the one I have so many times, this has forever put me in the red. Forever putting myself in depression and despair.

The third is community debt. Even though judicially I’ll have balanced the books, the community is not so forgiving. I’m a two time felon. My press makes me an unchanging villain. No matter what I say, do, or have done any charge is blinded by the accounting in the public's eye.

I’ve been preparing for that fateful day when Thy open the gates and call my name. You see I’m living a shunned double standard life like in federal prison. Thirteen years gone, three years, six months to go are preparing me to walk out. One lower life form on the food chain to a larger machine.

It’s okay though. Nothing the larger prison (of life) can throw at me that I haven’t dealt with within the smaller years, except death which I don’t fear. They believe a killer or druggies can be rehabilitated but there’s no help for me.

My mind keeps playing the tally, the pros and cons. I keep better records than the IRS or even Quickbooks. What do I do? How can the books ever be balanced? I can’t climb out of the hole of debt if I’m not given the means to do so. It almost feels like the welfare system is rigged and broken.

Don’t misunderstand, I’m not blaming anything or anyone but myself for the debts I’ve accumulated. However, it is an uphill battle I feel I can’t win. I’ve changed my lifestyle, my way of thinking, but nothing else has. It’s hard to see past that, I get it. Maybe some debts are never meant to be paid.

Don’t give me your pity. I haven’t earned it nor want it. Maybe somewhere in this darkness I can be given a chance. A chance to show the change, not to erase or forget the debt, but a chance to balance the scales and maybe even see a few pluses in the budget.

I can’t clear the debt without the tools, the opportunity, the chance being taken on me, maybe even a forgiveness of debt. I’m not ready for the trash, where all the worthless things go to die. Even a long dark tunnel had a faint light at its end, just the flicker of hope to drive me on.

To a true story there’s always a moral hidden or expressed. Why should this be any different than these? Some are obvious and some you need to dig deeper within to see it clearly.

Let me shed some light on this story. What’s the moral(s) we can learn? How about change? Change is good. I guess it could also be bad, but if you start from the bottom, into the corners where the dregs are changed can only be good.

Opportunity. That is the opportunity to make the debts good or at least less negative. Nothing changed without the opportunity to do so.

Lastly forgiveness. Maybe not total forgiveness, not everyone could agree. However, if it starts with you; it may start a trend. Almost everything could be forgiven by most, don’t you think?

The sheets could be balanced, the debt paid, and we move on to a better, more harmonious life.
