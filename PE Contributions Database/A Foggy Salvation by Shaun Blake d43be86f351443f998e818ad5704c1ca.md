**“A Foggy Salvation” by Shaun Blake**

Bursting out the outside security door, the four of us sprinted away from the youth facility into the night. After months of planning we were finally on our way toward an illusionary freedom. We knew that we still hadn’t accomplished our goal; the searchers would soon be our secret. A miracle the only way we had a chance. Four of us- Mark leading, Don and Conrad next, and I trailing- desperate to disappear.

We ran through a tatter of fog, thin and no higher than our knees. Blinking, I wondered if I was imagining it. Surely the night was too cold for fog. Another patch of ragged gray whisked by us to one side, larger than the first. It was growing, as if oozing from the ground. Fog enveloped us for a brief moment and was gone, came again and vanished behind. The icy mist left a chill on my face and hands. Then a wall of pale gray loomed before us and we were suddenly enshrouded. The thickness of it muffled our movements to dullness, and the cries from our pursuers- which had started to grow- seemed to come through a wall, and I could only just make out the shape of Don ahead. I increased speed so I wouldn’t be left behind.

Mark didn’t slow his pace. “There’s only one place to go, remember,” he called, his voice hollow and directionless. “Keep together and follow me.”

I shrank away from the icy fog. Feeling it to be unhealthy. I realized I was holding my breath and called myself an idiot. I had to make myself let that breath go and inhale. The air was heavy, colder, otherwise no different than on any other foggy night. I told myself that, but I wasn't sure I believed it. Mark kept encouraging us to stay where each could see the others in that damp, frosty grayness. Yet he still didn’t slacken his pace.

The shrill cries that had hounded us faded as we ran, and then were gone, but that gave small comfort. Dogs still barked, hollow and distant in the gray haze, but there was no other sound save the dull drumming of our feet. Nothing gave any hint of the passage of time except the growing ache in legs and back. My hands clenched until I wasn’t sure I could release them, and I wondered if I would ever walk normal again. I glanced back only once more. Shadows in the fog seemed to race behind me, but I couldn’t be certain. The chill and damp soaked through my shirt, soaked into my skin. Only the rush of air past my face and the gather and strain of my legs told me I was moving at all. It must’ve been hours.

“Hold up!” Mark softly called suddenly. “Stop!” I was so startled that I forged ahead, running into Don, before I could stop. Houses loomed in the fog on all sides. We had reached Mark’s destination. He strode forward again. “Follow me and keep quiet.”

Discomfited, I fell into place without complaint as the party moved deeper into the neighborhood. A lone dog, unseen in the cold mist, barked at us furiously, then ran away. Here and there a light appeared in a window as some resident stirred. Other than the dog, no sound save the muted steps of our feet disturbed the night. Mark stopped before a dark house that looked exactly like any other. Fog swirled around Mark like smoke as he strode forward alone, mounting the steps. At the top he hammered on the door. A light appeared in the window of the next house and someone shouted angrily. Mark kept on hammering. Abruptly, the door was flug back by a lady in a skimpy nightgown that barely covered her. A light from further inside illuminated a narrow fence with pointed features.

“What’s this?” She said angrily. “What’s going on?” Chill gray tendrils curled into the doorway, and she hurriedly stepped back. “Come back tomorrow,” she started to turn away. Mark caught her wrist, giving her a hard stare. She opened her mouth to protest; then, recognizing Mark, she licked her lips and stepped further back, letting us in. Chewing her lip, she shifted nervously, peered out at the mist laden night one last time, and closed and locked the door.

We found the help we’d hoped for. We had a chance now.
