**“Flying High” by Leo Cardez**

Eat the brownie, she said. You’ll feel better, she said. What she didn’t say was that her famous pot brownies were laced with LSD.

“She” is Kara, my stoner/hippie roommate. She’s just trying to help me relax. See, my National Guard unit was recalled, and I’m supposed to board a plane to Fort Hood, Texas for desert training before we deploy for some dusty patch of sand in the cradle of civilization. I just wanted the free tuition, but that was before 9/11. Now, I’m trading my books and beers for an M-16 and bullets. The last thing I think about before I take a bite is why I ever chose Combat Communications Specialist as my MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) – the key word: combat.

The brownies rock my world before I even board the plane. My world shifts into something much slower and brighter. Up until this point, I was mainly a drinker with the occasional puff of weed. I’m thinking today probably isn’t the best moment to lose my hallucinogenic virginity.

Somehow, I board without incident. I’m holding on to my seat feeling the harsh spikes up and down of a roller coaster.

“Ma’am how much longer will we be in this turbulence?” I ask the pretty stewardess.

“Sir, we haven’t left the gate,” she tells me with a skeptically raised eyebrow, “Are you ok?”

No, I’m not ok, I want to say. I’m as high as [edit: a giraffe]~~giraffe pussy.~~

“Yes ma’am, just peachy, just a nervous flier.”

She shuffles off to help someone secure their seatbelt – leaving me to the cold sweat puddle accumulating in my shoes.

I close my eyes and pray for sleep – it defies me. Colors meld. Sounds become emotions. I feel myself letting go, feeling weightless. BUT I’m not relaxed, quite the contrary. I’m stressed, anxious, and terrified – every nerve in my body is screaming. Hours pass like this until we mercifully land at Dallas International.

I board a service bus to M.E.P.S. (Military Entrance Processing Station) for intake. After they confirm my I.D., they administer a blood and urine test.

“What’s this for?” I ask.

“Drugs.” The bored nurse answers without looking away from her files. Uh oh - I think.

The next day I’m on a plane again – not to the Middle East, but back to Miami. My time in the service is over. They call it, “Other Than Honorable” discharge. Not quite as bad as Dishonorable, but definitely not as good as Honorable. I’m upset at myself, at Kara, at the Army. A part of me wanted to see what I was made of, wanted to have those stories. I saw my team; Lucero, Peltier, and Anderson before I left Dallas – I thought I saw a hint of anger in their eyes.

I don’t talk to Kara anymore – I move out the next semester. She was a bad influence. I write to the guys and send them care packages. They’re due back in a couple months. They have great stories, I’m sure, and I can’t wait to hear them.

Lucero didn’t make it, he wrote, just bad luck – wrong place, wrong time. It could have been me. Kara may very well have saved my life.
