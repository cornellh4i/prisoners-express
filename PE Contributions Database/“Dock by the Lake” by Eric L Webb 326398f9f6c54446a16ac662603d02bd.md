**“Dock by the Lake” by Eric L. Webb**

Who am I, a lonely soul feeling majestic to sit in onderance on this ancient wooden dock of height and safety by this lake? So still and calm it can be the dock. So the dock is my retreat. But just how wonderful would this dock be without also having the “knowledge” of the turbulent waves of this lake?

In the distance are two beautiful mountains, followed by another smaller mountain, then looking further still...the sky...then my mind soars farther into space, then into the galaxy, then into...what? Possibility born out of impossibility.

...returning to myself I know I am infinite.I am immortal..yet...mortal as I shift from the slight ache of sitting on such a life. My throat aches to be quenched with the water of life. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the very marrow of my bones throbs to be in tune with the original pulse of the stars that permeate this entire universe and existence of WHAT IS. SO I simply sit. I simply “be”. I exist.

Looking down into the lake, occasionally I see a fish glide by. I ponder calling out to him, just so I can point to the stars and say “Look! Look in there, look where you really came from!” But who would I really be crying out too? Him or me? Who am “I” really? Him or me...or both!? How silly to think I could do anything less then look in the mirror, ha!

...So I simply sit and be. Silent and One. All peoples, all things, all places... ONE. “Alone” by the dock by the lake. With only the original pulse of the One true beating heart to guide me. forever.
