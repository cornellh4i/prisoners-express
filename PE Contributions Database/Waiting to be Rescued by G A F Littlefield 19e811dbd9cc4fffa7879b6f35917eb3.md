**Waiting to be Rescued by G.A.F. Littlefield**

The winds of war. Blow back. From whence they came. I taste the toxic air, and it is acrid, and bitter, on my tongue.

Only words now. Where have all the flower children gone? Long time passing. Where have all the flower children gone? Long time ago.

A maelstrom of thoughts and ideas assault my mind. Random unconnected events coalesce and make connections. Promiscously redefining reality. And once again, I am praying for rain. Wishing for a Catcher in the Rye; a knight in rusted armour, for a damsel in distress.

Some look to warriors. Some rely on lies. All wearing masks, and ignoring the past. While ashes fall like snow. “Just like the dust in Hell’s Kitchen long ago.”

Someone whispers. More important. Stories and legends will rise. Teach your children well. Love is all. War is hate. Hate is Hell. While we’re waiting to be Rescued.
