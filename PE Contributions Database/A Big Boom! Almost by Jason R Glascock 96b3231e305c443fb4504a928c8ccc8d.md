**A Big Boom!.. Almost by Jason R. Glascock**

I work on kitchen equipment in the prison. Things like: dishwashers, booster heaters, hot carts, and warming tables. These are machines found in any commercial kitchen; they are everywhere. And, of course, they’re safe, right? Sure.

The types of machines found in commercial kitchens are safe, generally, when well maintained and a person knows what’s going on. They have 208VAC or 408VAC, enough power to arc, turning steel into slag instantly or boil the water in your blood to blow a hand off. We fixed a toaster the other day where a connection block (a point where high-voltage wires come into the machine to connect to the internal wires) had started on fire. Fire so hot it burned a hole through stainless steel before the breaker cut power 1/32 of a second later.

Well, these kinds of electrical forces can be very impressive, for sure, and dangerous. The way I describe it to impress the seriousness of safety on guys working in the kitchens here, is to say I deal with bombs that can kill everyone in the room. That gets their attention, and it’s not an exaggeration.

The bomb I’m specifically referring to is the booster heater. It’s a plain-looking box sitting under a counter with two little lights and switch. What it does is heat water to 180F for dishwashers to sanitize dishes. Without this heater, the dishwater would just recycle warm water mixed with all the saliva, blood, feces, snot, food, etc that was rinsed from all the previous trays put through the machine. Yum. To make these machines safe there are relief valves, breakers, and fuses. If there is too much heat it’s supposed to shut off. If there is too much pressure, it’s supposed to release water. If it draws too much voltage, a breaker should cut power.

That doesn’t always happen. An example is the university dorm out west; a six-story building blew up when things didn’t work. A personal account where this could have happened was had here a few months ago.

The booster heater had been on the fritz, so we replaced it. We rebuild the entire unit and replace everything but the tank and circuit board. The refurbished unit should last about 18 months. The replacement lasted a week, and it only came to our attention because I was in the servery working on something else and a worker mentioned a burning plastic smell coming from “that box over there.” When I opened it up I immediately saw the burned wires. The same wires burned as the one we replaced. Strange. Coincidence? Unlikely, but maybe. Instead of replacing the entire unit I decided to replace the heating element.

What I found was the element had exploded inside the tank, but instead of drawing enough power to trip the breaker, the stubs continued to get power and electrolyzing the water into hydrogen and oxygen. All it needed was to sit for a while without flushing new water into the system and the gases would’ve pushed the water level of the tank down for enough for it to expose the element stubs and spark...BOOM!

That was an almost-catastrophe caught because someone smelled a whiff of burning plastic. These ubiquitous, innocuous machines are only safe when working correctly, when well maintained. Please, please, PLEASE! If a machine is broken, sloppy, smells bad, get someone to look at it. Ask questions. Make noise before the noises are screams of pain from shrapnel ripping through your face.
