**“Puppy Love” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

I had two mixed chow chow

One’s fate was short ended and I had one now

A female whose litter was four

Then a German shepherd made one more

You were poisoned by a thief

It gave me much grief

Then one met a truck on the street

I opened the door but he wasn’t there for me to greet

One went in search of love and that left one

He was almost taken by a shotgun

The flu and age finally done him in

I don’t have the heart to start again

I do still thank God above

I thank him for puppy love
