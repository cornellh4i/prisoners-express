"**The Meeting" by Neal Randall**

****“How did I ever start smoking? I’ve always hated the smell of smoke. I wonder if I started smoking because of my dad? He had smoked for a while and then quit. I haven’t seen my dad since the last time we came to the park. He used to bring me here every Saturday. I was six years old then. He would always hold my hand above my head and let me twirl. He would push me in the swings and even ride the merry-go-round with me. But my favorite was twirling. I miss my dad so much.

It was a Friday afternoon, the sun was shining and I was waiting impatiently for Dad to get home. He had promised to take me and mom out to eat and then to a movie of choice. Being a six year old girly girl, I chose to see ‘Cinderella’. Dad never made it home that day. He was killed when a drunk driver hit him head on. To this day I have never seen ‘Cinderella.’”

Thirty-eight year old Sam sits on a bench watching a young girl smoke.

“Why would a beautiful young girl like her want to smoke? She ought to be with friends or with her dad doing something fun. I wonder if Shelly was still alive would she too try smoking? I still can’t believe that I lost her and her mom to a drunk driver. I think I’ll go over there and tell that girl she shouldn’t be smoking.”

“Hello,” Sam says as he looks down at the young girl.

“Go away pervert!” Heather sharply snaps.

“Pervert! I’m not a pervert young lady. I just wanted to tell you that you shouldn’t be smoking. That’s all.” Sam replied.

“What do you care pervert?” Heather smartly remarks.

“I told you I’m not a pervert! Does your dad know you smoke?” Sam asked.

Suddenly Heather snaps her eyes up at Sam and flicks the lit cigarette at him and then screams, “Go away you pervert! I hate you!” Tears burst from her eyes uncontrollably.

“Wait a minute now. Ah crap, I guess I wouldn’t have made a good father if Shelly had lived.” Tears began filling Sam’s eyes.

Heather quickly glanced up. “What do you mean if she had lived. Who is Shelly?”

Sam explained to Heather all about his wife and daughter being killed by a drunk driver. He told her how he used to bring his daughter here to the park every Saturday. How she loved for him to hold her hand above her head and let her twirl. He loved pushing her in the swings and even riding the merry-go-round with her. He told Heather that all in all Shelly loved to twirl.

Heather can’t hold back her tears as she feels the pain of a father that’s lost his little girl. “I’m sorry I called you a pervert.” Heather says. Sam gave no reply.

Heather then began to tell Sam the story of her dad.

She also told Sam that she feels like she has lost her mother also. She told him how her mother never does anything anymore.

After listening to Heather’s story he could feel the pain of a daughter that loved her father. “Let me see your hand.” Sam said as he reached down and grabbed Heather’s hand.

“Hey! I thought you weren’t a pervert?” Heather hollered out.

“I’m not a pervert! Now come on!” Sam smiled. When Heather stood up Sam led over to the grass and then raised her hand above her head.

“What are you doing?” She asked.

“You love to twirl don’t you? Doesn’t twirling bring back good memories of your dad?” He asked.

“I don’t know. I haven’t twirled since the accident.” Heather smiled. Then slowly, shyly, she began to twirl. Then she twirled faster and faster. Her laughter filled Sam’s heart with love. He hasn’t felt this love since the last time he twirled his daughter. He too laughed.

For over an hour they both laughed, they cried, they twirled in circles with no cares or worries for the rest of the world. Two broken hearts joined as one by the twirling winds of change.

Father and daughter twirling in circles of love on the stage of life. Twirling in the spotlight of God’s shining sun.

That was two years ago, Heather remembers as she watched Sam stand nervously in front of the preacher in his sterling white tuxedo. Sam looks over at Heather, as he sees how beautiful she is in her pink chiffon bridesmaid dress. As the music starts they both look down the aisle at the radiant beauty in her long sterling white wedding dress. As she slowly walks down the aisle to a new life she had never dreamed possible, Heather whispered, “You’re beautiful mom.”

For their honeymoon, Sam had made a promise to take both his lovely new wife and his lovely new daughter out to eat and then to a movie. Even though Heather is nearly sixteen years old, her face is glowing in the darkened theater room as she sits between her mother and her new father, watching “Cinderella”.

Heather silently speaks as she squeezes Sam’s hand and her mother’s hand, “Thank you God for leading me to that park bench on that beautiful Saturday afternoon. And thank you God for the meeting.”
