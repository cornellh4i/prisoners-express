**Caduceus Cave by Brian Stevens**

The morning light hurts my eyes. My ears are still echoing from the blast. They tried to trap me in the cave, but after 3 days I found another way out. The cool mountain mist cloaks everything in mystery, as if trying to hide the horror, but I can smell the death in the air. The silence is deafening. My heart stops dead in my chest, then the shock and terror brings me back to life. They not only blew up the entrance to the cave, they also burned down the whole nearby village. Bastards! These were peaceful, innocent people who were just trying to make a living. What looked like old photos of napalmed Vietnam, was present day Mexico.

As I sift through the ashes, a woman snaps my photo. I think she could tell I was in no mood to have my picture taken so she quickly introduces herself, “Hi, I’m Crystal Cortez, wildlife photographer. What the hell happened here?”

“Johnny Hall, virologist, and you wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” I replied.

“Try me,” she said, “I’ve been tracking endangered species, so I cross paths with poachers, drug cartels, and corrupt officials all too often.” She stares at me for a moment and I get a sense of genuine concern.

I probably shouldn’t, but I decide to tell her, “The pharmaceutical company I worked for did this, Gatehouse,”

“Gatehouse?” she responds. “They’re the biggest company in the U.S., what do they care about a village of Natives?”

I answer, “They didn’t want anyone to find out about the research I was doing in the cave, so they blew it up with mining explosives along with the village. They tried to bury me in the cave, but I found a way out.”

“My God,” she gasped.

“It’s not safe here, we should go,” I tell her.

“You know a place?”

“Yeah, a cantina in town.”

“Sounds good,” she says.

“I’m starving.” I admit, despite being surrounded by bits of human bones and bodies.

After chowing down two plates of beef fajitas and chasing them with two ice cold margaritas, I’m ready to continue. “They took a virus from the bats.”

“Bats?” Crystal asks.

“Yeah,” I go on, “Local villagers near the cave had become ill with a virus that was similar to one found in Myanmar, on the other side of the world. It had pandemic potential, so Gatehouse wanted to get a head start on a vaccine, should an outbreak occur. As an expert on wildlife diseases, they hired me to go study the bats.”

“What did you find out?” she asks, now very interested.

I explain, “We discovered that if a pathogen from the bats spilled over to humans a pandemic was possible, but if kept in an isolated area, the virus could be contained and possibly die out on its own. Likewise, if introduced to a densely populated area, it could spread very easily and quickly get out of control. Gatehouse already has a patent on a vaccine that could be worth billions, maybe trillions, but it’s useless without a virus to treat. I believe they are about to unleash a virus, kill millions, and tried to murder me to cover it up.” A moment of silence ..

“So what can we do?” Crystal asks.

“Not much we can do.” I tell her. “They have the government and media in their pocket, but they’re expecting to have a vaccine delivered, so let’s send ‘em one.” I have invested in an agave plantation just outside town where I kept a small, secret lab for personal research. I had enough Gatehouse materials there to put together a phony vaccine package that looked like it came from their official facility. Only instead of a vaccine derived from bats, I was sending a lethal toxic venom taken from snakes.”

“Think they’ll really fall for it?” Crystal wondered as we sent it out.

“Probably not,” I replied, but never underestimate the arrogance of assholes, especially rich ones.

Two days later … Gatehouse headquarters, San Francisco. William B. Gatehouse owner and CEO of Gatehouse Pharmaceuticals holds a meeting with the heads of Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks: “Greetings and welcome my dear friends and colleagues. As generous investors in the Gatehouse company, I have called you here for a special announcement. We are about to embark on an extremely profitable enterprise and a cleansing of America. Our product will be the #1 seller in the history of medicine, and I’m here to present you with the very first sample, straight from our research facility in Mexico. They were even kind enough to mix it with their finest blue agave tequila - Caduceus Cave - for us all to enjoy. So please raise your glasses as I propose a toast - to health and wealth!”
