**Accomplishments by Housey Antwon**

Proving yourself to those who said you couldn’t complete a certain goal. Accomplishing the impossible is such a rejuvenation feeling. I remember a teacher I once had for the third grade. She would always tell me that I wouldn’t make it to see my 25th birthday. Well that’s one accomplishment that I’m glad I had the opportunity to accomplish. I aged this year in Feb on the 28th even though I was trapped in a 8 x 10 cell with no roommate. I didn’t want to go to sleep before the clock said 12:00 a.m. That’s why I chose to tell this story before as a little child I had a deep sense of death following me around. I conquered the expectations of the people who were supposed to inspire me to be the best within my capacity. Yet they printed me this great fear of death, until my 25th born day, however maybe my teacher did know something that I didn’t know because when I really put thought to the current events in my journey. I found myself incarcerated at the age of seventeen. MAybe my teacher meant to say I wouldn’t see my 25th born day with my family, or in the “free world”. Why do I get the feeling that the one accomplishment that I felt the most secure about it is the one that I may not have accomplished in its entirety. Ironic?!
