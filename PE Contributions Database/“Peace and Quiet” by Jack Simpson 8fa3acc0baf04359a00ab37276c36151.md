**“Peace and Quiet” by Jack Simpson**

Prison has been known to make or break a person. A lot of that depends upon if the person wants to change their life or not. After three decades here, a little peace and quiet would be well respected. Things haven’t always been easy in life. Just like most people here. I hit a bump in the road. I never thought the hole would be so deep or wide.

The main thing about being here is to put oneself in check. Set a goal and work toward it. Saving what you can here and there. Even if it is only a couple dollars each payday, I have set a little back each time. So I’m not broke. Not rich by a long shot.

There was an older gentleman who became my friend. I’m not beyond helping anyone who needs it. Just like the outside we have people who try to scam people all the time. That is how they live and it soon catches up with them.

Everything that is told to a person has to be taken with a grain of salt. Trust is hard to find here and it will leave a person without any friends.

The older gentleman who is a true friend, Mr. George, never asked anything from me nor would I take anything from him unless he and I understood it got returned.

There are tales of how so many were beyond rich and how they lived on the street. To be honest with you, if I walk into a room and it is trashed, then this person lived that way on the street or he lived with his parents.

One thing I can say about Mr. George: His room was clean and no awful smell. It was neat and fresh. He lived alone in his cell. So we talked and shared life’s possibilities. I told him of my future plans upon release.

The week before my release, he handed me a brown clasp envelope. I was to open it on the way to the airport. Coffee stained the front cover. The corners were battered and had been taped back in place.

“You take this, young man,” he said as his voice trailed off in defeat. “I have held on to this dream for years. Now it is fading like myself.” His age told he had been here for sometime and was getting tired of being confined. His voice was low and the rasp told me he was getting worse as the days went on.

I know who is for real and not just another person who deserves to be here. I listened to him with all he said. His eyes told that he was sincere with his comment. I thanked him for the positive note. Follow the information I provided inside. File the paperwork once there, giving my name as a reference. I smiled and walked to my room.

The day had finally come for my release. The bag held all what I would need for a couple of days. I turned to see if I could spot Mr. George on the yard before leaving through the gate. He was not in sight.

The flight would take hours, then I would be in the state of Alaska. A short nap and being free wasn’t all that different or important at the moment. I dreamed of Mr. George and the time we shared. It finally hit home before the plane started to land. Mr. George was passing away. Not only did the sadness set in. I was now living his dream also.

I had been living in Alaska for more than two months when a letter arrived. It was from one of our friends at the prison. He wished me well and told of how Mr. George passed away holding the photo of myself sitting on the pier. My feet resting in the water.

A true friend is hard to find. I had that for sure in Mr. George. There will be no more count times or standing counts for either of us. Just good peace and quiet. He had his dream and so did I.

I had Mr. George’s body flown to Alaska and he and I now share the land. Most of all it started out his dream first. It is only proper that we both share it.
