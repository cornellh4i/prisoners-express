**“Blink of an Eye” by Detrick Shaw**

Living in a world like this where best friends become strangers, quotes like never let them see you sweat or SMILE when they think you’re down have been the norm, making the throwing the rock and then hiding your hand expression seems a cool thing to do.

Only at day’s end would it become clear that the very small piece I see in my mind’s eye is never a part of this puzzle. See the world as you turn, I should maintain this memory that I may be gone, but not forgotten. As I am intelligent enough in my current circumstances to fully understand, I’ll be back in the blink  of an eye...
