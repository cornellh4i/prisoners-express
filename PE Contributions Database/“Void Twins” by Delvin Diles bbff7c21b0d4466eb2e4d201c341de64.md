**“Void Twins” by Delvin Diles**

****Their father told them not to play with firewalls, but they couldn’t help themselves. Born 48 years after the Merge, one of their first responses to the System was to dig beneath its surface. As with everyone, Keisha and Meisha Lin were born with certain traits; an inquisitive resistance to the world’s barriers was evident in them, even as infants.

A hired nurse pointed to a holo from a home mindscanner, exclaiming, “Look at that, Mr. Lin! They’re trying to breach already!” Their father, Christopher Lin, founder and C.E.O. of NeuNav Psyware, wasn’t surprised. In fact, he ordered his twin daughters’ cyber-acuity during his wife’s first trimester. Prenatal cognitive structuring in 2098 was common, especially for the rich. Not caring to discuss his daughters’ enhancements, his response to the nurse was proud but turse. “Well, how about that?”

There would be more digital thresholds in his daughters’ development over the years. They didn’t talk much but always conspired and collaborated in silence. Mr. Lin, at first, thought their attempts to mindhack were cute. Cybersecurity had evolved to the point that hacking was virtually obsolete. The post-Merge world was blanketed by invisible arrays from satellites and scanners that received and decoded every neural impulse of every psyche on the planet. So any hacking had to be 100% mental. But as tech advanced, firewalls became reflexive. Breach detection was as instantaneous as decision itself. Not even virtual art encryption worked anymore. Unless while watching a bio-holo on the Anonymous Revolution or something similar, in headspace, cybercrime was a waste of time.

Until the Lin twins heard about physics.

Once they realized that light travels at 299,792,458 meters per second through physical space, they knew mindspeed was whatever they imagined it to be. THey started mentally tracking arrays everywhere they went and became more and more disinterested in interacting with other people. The more their father tried to suggest extracurricular activities, the more resistant to social involvement they became. They preferred to analyze the world from the margins, mostly because what they saw--contention, corruption, despair, the System--they didn’t like. On walks, at school, even at home during dinner, they silently constructed array-grid models together in a cog-sym bubble accessible only by them. Mr. Lin could only frown in disapproval and shout, “Girls, stop that!” They just giggled and continued to triangulate and manipulate the System. Their gift became not so cute anymore.

The cognitive-symbiosis bubble they built grew exponentially as their thought speed increased constantly. By the time they were pre-teens, the arrays could no longer track Meisha/Keisha. Their neural energy was undetectable: they were virtual voids.

At first, their father just accepted it. Though worried, he felt there was nothing he could do. His daughters were anomalies. He only hoped nothing bad would come of their digital non-existence. Maybe they would find something useful or harmlessly creative to do with their talent.

In a way, he got his wish. The twins wanted a more personal space, so they decided to build their own city beneath the surface of the largest planet in our solar system: Jupiter. Their dad may have been proud if the project wasn’t funded by billions of stolen dollars. It was a theft untraceable from millions of accounts since the girls instantly re-created the money electronically, a trick they did several times before for fun but on a much smaller scale.

Stealth drone jet fleets flew tons of material and automated construction bots to the jumbo planet. Jupiter has been surveyed and sampled, but remained unpopulated since no one had the funds to have robo-constructors durable and advanced enough to operate in the sub-zero slush terrain and atmosphere. Their city was spacy and distance, as they wanted. Since money to the Void Twins was infinitely replaceable, hydrogen fusion-powered machinery put their project on the fastest, undetectable, most efficient track possible.

By their 18th birthday, their city, miles beneath Jupiter’s frigid surface, was complete. It was basically a bioµ´encasing a massive maze of climate controlled corridors and plush living spaces, as well as a bio-engineered ecosystem. All surfaces were of synthetic interactive titanium. Farms were plentiful with automated maintenance. Every atom and fiber in the city were known and felt by the twins like nerves on the surface of their skin, functionally connected as their ability to blink.

Sitting in one of their many rooms, they posted their first holo vid on Facebook VR. This was mainly to let their dad know about their whereabouts. Still, they felt it was in good taste to offer something visually artistic, so they improvised 3-D printed hair follicle nanobots, then mindfully intertwined their hair into a single braid before introducing the world to theirs. THis was the first time they allowed others to interact with them since becoming voids. The mass of questions, requests, and constant noisiness soon annoyed Meisha/Keisha.

And when their father began to scream demands that they return, they had enough of social media. The System lost track of them for the last time.

The twins decided that only quiet, inquisitive minds would populate their biome. They sat for hours in search for the sincerest serene souls on Earth. The first one they touched was a kindred spirit, also in exile.

He was doing life for multiple counts of mind-hacking and mental assaults as a teenager, but he was no longer entertained by abusing minds with modified psyware. In fact, now in his 40’s, after over 20 years of being alone with his own mind, a reverant interest in human consciousness grew in him. So he spent much of his time enjoying the profound, poetic muses of the mind by ancient philosophers such as Descartes, Kant, and Schopenhauer. As he read a passage from the latter (“A man’s life, in all its events great and small, is as necessarily predetermined as are the movements of a clock.”), he heard a distinct, clear, double-whisper as if inside both his ears at once, “It’s time to leave.” Before he could question the voices, an intercom blared an announcement: “Inmate Diles, pack your property for transfer!”
