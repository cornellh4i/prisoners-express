**“Never Accepted” by Marvin Jones**

****There should be smiles on the faces of men whom are proud to serve their country, but in reality this country has taken the joy from the hearts of its black men and women, living in fear of a nation set on the systematic and deliberate destruction of its black citizens.

Not the whole nation is against black Americans but those who are in positions of authority and they misuse that authority for their wicked pleasure.

As children we are taught people in uniforms are here to help, to serve and to protect, when did someone in uniform become a real life boogeyman?

I doubt these few black men in uniform would have risked their lives if they’d known fifty years later that racism would be alive and well here in America. How many men in this picture believed they’d be accepted by this country after what they gave to serve it? Maybe half! How many would have thought their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren would be killed by men in uniform just because they were black? I’d say from the looks on their faces...all of them!
