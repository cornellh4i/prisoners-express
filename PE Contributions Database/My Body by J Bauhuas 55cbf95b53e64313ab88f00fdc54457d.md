**My Body by J. Bauhuas**

You wish you had my body. It’s been a high performance off-road machine for about 70 years now. I take good care of it. It has rewarded me with great service. It doesn’t look like these beat-up rag-tops parked in this shit-bog. My body’s got no flats, no bald spots; it doesn’t have around a big barrel of blubber like a dump truck. When the headlights turn on, it leaps to the starting gate and is ready to rip-roar down the track to achievement, every day. While my body is burning up the track, and I hear behind me is coughing, groaning, sighs and grunts. I don’t wonder what they did to their bodies: I already know. They’ve got puckered scars up-side the hood, dents in both front fenders, missing parts of their grills, bashed-in trunk lids and caked-on mud. Their bodies look like they came out of a demolition derby. These are the lucky ones. The others are dead in a ditch or towed off to the junkyard to be scavenged for parts I used to give them jumps when they stand out, but they never seemed to learn how to keep their batteries charged. Every time, they’d leave the dome light on, forget to close the door, or never fix the glove-box door. The waste of my time and effort just got too great. I stopped babysitting most of them years ago. Now, I leave them in the ditch for the next guy to take care of. I watch closely for them to stray out of their lane. I speed up, slow down, change lanes, stop or even turn corners when they bumble too close. Sometimes, it’s like their wrecks try to bump up to me. I never let this happen. If I allowed one of them to dent me, or scratch my paint, more damage would accumulate quickly as I began thinking, “what’s one more dent?” You keep your wrecks. I’ll keep my body.
