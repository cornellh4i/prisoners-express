**"Holy Jihad" by Chad Dias**

Though hard to tell given the veil this woman is crying for the innocent civilian that lies in her arms. Who unfortunately became the victim of a jihadi bomb. Detonated by a Muslim truly lost in his faith. Who was compelled to commit this blatant act of hate by the persuasive nihilistic propaganda misconstrued as being part of Holy Jihad in the name of Islam. Actively spread by all those who misinterpret the truth found within the Noble Quran. Thus misleading all those who don’t know what it fully means to strive in the cause of Allah. Like Gabriel said to the Prophet Muhammad (of whom peace and blessings are upon) “Read!” Hopefully, you’ll see the truth of which amounts to the Islamic actions found within Sahih Muslim & Al Bukhari hadiths. And for a thorough understanding of what is written within the Noble Quran read the various volumes of the Tafsir. Because true Muslims don’t adhere to the rhetoric of Islamic Terrorist beliefs. Because it isn’t the sunnah the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings) readily preached.
