**“Where the Wind Blew Pt. 2”  by Cambren Thomas**

Before the assortment of new media mics and cameras, I stood feeling both disoriented and nervous. I had seen, and heard of, many odd things during my years in law enforcement; but nothing like this. In the blink of an eye, this guy was gone, I had no answers. I had no theories. So I just gathered the gumption to speak, and gave the reporters the basics.

“I am Detective Abram Forster, lead investigator into the disappeara -- ESCAPE, of inmate Matthew Caine. He was here last night, at Stone Hill Correctional, when court cleared around 9:15PM. Then, shortly after, he...fled the premises. Wherever he is, however he did it… is still under investigation. Please use your local crime lines, if you have any information regarding this man’s whereabouts. Thank you.”

I made my own escape, back toward Stone Hill’s Segregated Housing U.nit, at a brisk pace. I passed plenty of frantic and bewildered prison staff, but otherwise it was pretty quiet out on the main boulevard. The entire compound was on an indefinite lockdown until this whole mess was sorted out. I soon entered the disheveled aftermath of Caine’s cell, hoping the forensics team had found some solid leads by now.

I asked, to no one in particular, “Any updates?” A fairly new and tech savvy specialist stepped up to the plate. “Luke Roberts sir, we have looked over the cell, and around the compound. There are no legitimate signs of any suspicious contraband, or any attempts to escape. But, I reviewed the security camera footage earlier and...it’s quite strange.”

My interest was piqued, “How strange?” Roberts scrunched his brow, in search of the right way to say it. “Um, maybe you should view the footage first, detective?” Roberts passed me the tablet he was holding, and continued, “This particular angle is facing toward Caine's cell window. The event occurs in milliseconds, but the playback has been significantly slowed down. Now watch closely.”I took a breath, and pressed play. What I saw was beyond rational explanation. “What am I looking at here Roberts? I see Caine at the window, he turns, and then…,” I pantomimed a twirling tornado with my index finger.

I continued replaying the footage. Roberts continued his rundown, “At first, I thought maybe it was some form of spontaneous combustion. So we did a full tech-sweep for traces of biological remains. A peculiar trail of DNA fragments was discovered. It leads from the cell interior, through the window, out along the grass and basketball court, and on up to the guard tower. Even on a guard’s hat, found just outside the fences. But these fragments were not linked to any bodily substance, like blood of saliva, detective. Though we did match the DNA to control samples found on a few of Caine’s personal items.”

My logical grasp, on this situation, was weakening...I aimed and fired a quick response. “So what does all this mean, Roberts?” We’re here to investigate a NORMAL inmate escape!” Roberts detected my hint of annoyance, and proceeded with caution. “Well, detective Forster, may I be completely honest?”

I handed him back his tablet and gave him my full attention.” The evidence here, implies something that is...inexplicably unique - something beyond any NORMAL investigative perceptions. This is something supernatural.” I didn’t debate, or deny him. I lightened up and yielded, “But that makes this a little out of our jurisdiction, right Roberts? Where are those two agents from the X-files? Where’s Professor Xavier and the X-men? Maybe we need Scooby Doo and the gang?”We shared a brief laugh. It diffused the growing tension.

Roberts then moved in closer, with a glint of excitement in his eyes. “Detective, if we really want to uncover the truth, we could use an alternative perspective. I may know someone that can aid us in the investigation.” I sighed disbelief, but bit the bait in a low reply, “make it happen...quick and quiet.”

Roberts rushed off to contact his unconventional connection. I remained standing, in the cell Matthew Caine had called “home” for over nine and half years, staring out of the window. The surrounding pines were swaying, and mocking me, in a steady wind. Caine was out there somewhere. I felt it in my core. But where? How?
