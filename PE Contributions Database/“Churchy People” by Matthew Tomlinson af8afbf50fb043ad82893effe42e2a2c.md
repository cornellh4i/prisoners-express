**“Churchy People” by Matthew Tomlinson**

Brazoria County Detention Center in Angleton, Texas has a place for old goats who don’t want to behave. They had me locked up in the isolation cells. These are a set of 12 cells with traditional bars on the front. These isolation cells are along a narrow, narrow hallway, and this corridor might have been 36 inches from the bars of Ten Cell on one side to the bars of Five Cell on the other. It was no stretch for us to reach across the hallway to pass, for example, a cup of coffee. There was only one way into or out of the isolation cells area, and the other end of the hall was a dead end.

Bright and early one Saturday morning, two of those Churchy People came from my left, down that narrow hallway. They passed my Ten Cell and went all the way down to my right, to the dead end, to visit the guy in Seven Cell. That isn’t a bad idea at all. Anyone in county jail could use some visits from some Churchy People, even if he isn’t so churchy himself. They ended their visit with a prayer. Again that’s not a bad idea. Anyone locked up anywhere needs all the prayers we can get. This prayer went long then got louder, then it got longer still. And it got louder! My contribution was: “Hey! Hold it down! God can hear you just fine without all that yelling. I’m trying to sleep down here. Be careful about yelling at God unless you want God to yell at you.”

The Churchy People concluded their yell-prayer. They thereafter had to pass right b the bars of my Ten Cell to get out, and I was standing silently at the bars. These stalwart defenders of the yell-prayer faith had trouble facing their fears. THey pushed their buttocks against Five Cell across the hall to slither as far away from me as they could get, which wasn’t as far as they wanted. There was no need. I’d said all that needed to be said. Proverbs 20:3, first half: “It is an honor for a man to cease from strife…”

Once the Churchy People were safely past Ten Cell, one asked me if a Bible study course would interest m.e A silent shake of my head was enough said. Proverb 20:3, last half: “...but every fool will be meddling.” This Churchy Guy then said, “Oh no! Of course you don’t want a Bible study course! I know who you are! You’re a son of Satan! Curse you, Satan! I have no fear of you because the blood of Christ protects me! I am a child of God, and you have no power over me! Curse you, Satan! Curse you!”

By that time, my arms were hanging out of Ten Cell. A swift experiment would prove whether this Churchy Guy either was or was not protected by the blood of Christ. “All right, I tell you what you do. If you truly believe you’re a child of God, then bring yourself a little closer to my bars, and I’ll damn sure send you home to Him!”

Of course the Churchy Guy did not have the faith to face his fears. He and his partner prudently left the area, yet he kept chanting his yell-prayer: “Curse you, Satan! Curse that demon in Ten Cell!”

Monday morning, a complaint was mailed to Chaplain of Brazoria County Detention center. The entire incident was related just as you read it in Prisoner Express. These two Churchy People are banned from county jail.

*Facinus Quos Inquinat Aequat*. Villany makes all those whom it contaminates equal in character. The Bible calls me--and you too--a lost sheep for whom Christ died, and for whom Christ will intercede before my final judgement. Then who was that Churchy GUy? Was he speaking as the Dragon would speak, or as the Lamb?

What about you? Did you pick up that Bible when you came to TDCJ with me? Fine business. But whatever you’re going to be, just be that. Preach to me by what you do. That’ll carry more weight than anything you can say. God can hear you just fine, even if you rarely say a word.
