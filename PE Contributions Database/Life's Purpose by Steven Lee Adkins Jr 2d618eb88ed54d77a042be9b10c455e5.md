**Life’s Purpose by Steven Lee Adkins Jr**

The phrase ‘my life flashed before my eyes’ is well documented by so many people that it has become a cliche and presumed to happen or will happen to everyone. This is believed with a nearly religious dedication and revered by the majority as a true and awe inspiring event. Truly, cowards greatly outnumber the brave. Cowards always think of themselves first.

In my opinion, when people near death, they selfishly think of what or who they’ll miss. Those dearest to them, come to the forefront of their cerebral and arrest their focus completely. Off handedly, think of a sword. Now a tennis ball, a child, a book, a tree.

Images easily arrive in your mind's eye, with little effort and much clarity. Is it so awe inspiring that in extreme situations like the concluding of one's life, memories and images flood clearly through, like a film? When someone we love dies, the majority of people are thinking only of themselves. What am I going to do? Why did this happen to me? Et cetera; et cetera. Translate this over to the majority who are dying. I didn’t get to do this or that. I never got to see this or that. Now the brave, a rare breed, whose deeds are honorable and dared to live life fully, who think of others first, are the minority who do not meet their ancestors and gods snivelling about selfish things they’ll miss.

Much of the 21st century aren't living, their content with just existing. What’s so awe inspiring about the majority who tell us of their lives; flashing before their eyes’ when they’ve lived a life that would put you to sleep viewing the highlights? I’m very surprised they got to vouch for it, instead of dying more quickly from being bored to death by what ‘flashed before their eyes’.

Clinging to life so desperately to continue a mundane and meaningless existence. And pridefully live to tell of it. I plan to meet my death just as I met my birth. Bloody and struggling. Protected? Instead of many protecting their past memories, they should consider protecting that which continues beyond death; deeds, honor and how they die.

I will protect our women and children with violence. Regardless of consequences, acceptance, judgement or anything else that exists. If more people whereas like minded and taught this by example the future generations, the necessity to do so would decrease rapidly. Children are defenseless, we are to defend them. Women are formidable, but in these times, are taught to value being beautiful instead of being taught value self-defense.

So women are capable, but many cannot defend themselves. That leaves the task to men of honor, to make sacrifices to secure a safe existence for our women and children. Protecting them with our lives if necessary.
