**"Smoking" by Shane Brewer**

****True story: the boys and I loved smoking--we thought we were cool. Everywhere we would go, we’d make smoke come out our noses and even do french inhales and ghost bombs. But I’m no longer friends with these boys. I don’t think I’ve seen them in 10-12 years. We thought we would never split, but people do wrong and have to go away sometimes. I miss smoking the the boys, but I just miss the boys in general. I miss friends, family, and my loving fiance. I love smoking: it’s like an awesome release, and still to this day, I think I still look cool doing French inhales.
