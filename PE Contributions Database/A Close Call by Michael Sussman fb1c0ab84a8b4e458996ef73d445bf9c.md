**A Close Call by Michael Sussman**

My senior year at Yuma High School was coming to an end, and my girlfriend Angie and I had been invited to a prom party at the house of a mutual friend. Couples were to arrive there early for a picture-taking session, and then we would leave together to go to the dance. Afterward, we would all return to the house, where we would play games and watch movies until morning.

Angie and I had been dating for six months and we shared a lot in common-- for example, we both loved to sneak out and go on romantic adventures together. As Yuma is located in the southwestern armpit of Arizona and is surrounded by desert, our options as teenages were limited, but we made do. Some mornings we would drive out to the Mesa del Sol golf course and sit on a random fairway to watch the sunrise; some days we would pull out a map, find a nearby small town we’d never been to, and drive there so we could explore it; some nights we would go for a drive and look for a particularly lonely or interesting colored light off in the far distance, so we could try to make our way there and find out the light’s purpose. Really, we just loved spending time together as best friends.

On the day of the party, our parents had given permission for both of us to attend, but Angie and I were busy hatching other plans. We had spied a rare opportunity to spend the whole night together, just the two of us, and we felt obligated to take advantage of it. So we came up with the brilliant idea to go camping.

Angie had never been camping before, but my dad had taken our family out many times into the desert surrounding the Gila Mountains. We would go on a day hike, roast marshmallows over the campfire, and then sleep at night in a tent, or sometimes in our sleeping bags under the stairs. What this meant, of course, is that I had access to all the camping supplies Angie and I would need.

We departed from my house, telling my parents that we were heading over to the prom party early to hang out. Our shorts-and-t-shirt attire was easily explained by the assurance that we were going to change over at our friend’s house, and we made a big show of packing up our formal dress wear. My dad had given me permission to use the SUV, a green GMC Jimmy; what he didn't know was that Angie had spent the last twenty minutes pulling camping gear out of our storage shed and passing it to me over the backyard wall, while I used my tetris skills to load the back of the Jimmy.

Our first stop was the grocery store to purchase hot dogs, chips, marshmallows, and other junk food, and to fill up our five-gallon water jug. Then we headed north out of the city in search of a nice camping spot. I had never really paid attention to where my dad drove when we went camping, but I figured it wasn’t rocket science: you drive until you hit desert, you find a flat place without any cacti, and you set up camp.

After a time, the two-lane highway bent eastward and with the setting sun blinding me in the rearview mirror, I realized it was already four-thirty. We needed to find a spot soon while we still had daylight.

I spied a likely-looking dirt road and turned onto it, mentally crossing my fingers. We were in luck! The desert terrain on both sides was amazingly flat: no large, unpleasant rocks, and little sign of cacti-- or any desert flora, for that matter. I drove for another five minutes before turning off at an indiscriminate location, pulling forward another fifty feet or so and parking. Time to set up.

Sngie was busy digging the fire pit and I was pounding stakes for the tent when I noticed three vehicles in the distance, driving toward us across the desert plain. One of them had flashing lights. As they approached, we heard a voice yell over a loudspeaker: “Stop what you’re doing immediately! Do not move!”

It turned out that Angie and I had ventured onto the Yuma Proving Grounds, and there were unexploded bombshells and other ordnance all around us. At any moment, either one of us could have struck paydirt.

The military police took out IDs, ran background checks, and quickly realized we were two dumb teenagers. All I remember saying was, “Please don’t tell our parents!” They didn’t, but they escorted us off the property and admonished us to never return. We didn’t.

But we did go to the prom party. :)
