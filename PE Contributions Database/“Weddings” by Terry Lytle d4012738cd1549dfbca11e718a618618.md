**“Weddings” by Terry Lytle**

****Weddings are like miracles: there’s magic in the air; flowers; ancestors; and, in the blink of an eye, jealousy will have the enchanted… emerging from the fog.

The magic of just being with the one you love amongst the flowers of our children and ancestors, emerges one from the fog. No jealousy here, for, in the blink of an eye I realize this is “for life,” love and honor.

How to explain all the things forgiven and hoped for… We’ve been “married,” hopelessly romantic, since the age of 15. To be in our wedding at 27… Cindy, I still love you like the first.

Your jealousy is like magic. Loving you for so much, I never needed the wedding… you’re the only girl I’ve ever fallen in love with more than once– who needs vows? Jealousy- unchained- would be its own death.

There’s no “properties” in love; no “papers.” Titles and “documents” are for cars and trucks and houses… not hearts. Weddings are joinings, not bonds. As two souls, coalesce into one all is well, for love’s knot is not undone.

Who can fathom, nights up on a tin roof, stars so close it’s as if we could reach them and touch them. And what of the white circle, around the moon… to such a rebel like me, it was magic- miracle!- telling me that you were my angel… come to me, so that I may wed. After 12 years of hell, prison solitaries, and pain… the only thing missing was the new growth, life and magic, of an Arizona rain.

So, when it snowed, that bright, sunny day after we said our vows, I knew my life had changed. For better or worse, carrying you under the threshold of Serenity’s mountain cabin door… I silently and spiritually vowed to never stop loving you.

After all, that’s what weddings are: the love of two hearts, becoming one.
