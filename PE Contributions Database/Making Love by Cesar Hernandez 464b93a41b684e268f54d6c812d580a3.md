**Making Love by Cesar Hernandez**

There are many ways to meditate. It’s a wonderful discovery when we learn this. One of the most powerful forms of meditation is stopping meditation. The reason this is so powerful is that it can be done anywhere, and it takes very little time. Therefore, it is perfect for busy people “on the go!”

Stopping meditation means just that. It means we stop whatever we are doing for just a minute and pay attention to something about it. We dissect it in that moment and then look closely at one of its individual pieces.

This is a little different from walking meditation in that it does not take a half hour or more, as walking meditation can take. In walking meditation we deliberately take a walk for the deliberate purpose of focusing on a deliberate experience. In stopping meditation we do not use nearly as much time, but we can accomplish the same thing: focus.

Stopping meditation can be used in the midst of a very busy day. Combined with sitting meditation and walking meditation it can create a powerful trio of tools that can dramatically alter your reality and raise your consciousness within a very short period of time. Yet even if used as the only form of meditation, it can be transformative.

Let’s say you are washing your hands. Stop what you are doing for ten seconds- just stop in the middle of it- and peer deeply inside one aspect of what you are doing. Look, perhaps, at the water. See it splashing on your hands. See if you can count the drops of water on your hand. Just count the water drops, we know it is an impossible task, but undertake to do it anyway, just for ten seconds.

Now pull yourself out of that highly focused reality and back into the larger space of your experience. Don’t get “lost” in it. Blink your eyes rapidly, or shape your finger, and literally snap out of it. Then, notice what you experienced for that brief moment.

Now go on with what you were doing. Yet don’t be surprised if it takes on a whole new quality.

What you have done is truly appreciate something. To “appreciate” something is to make it larger, to increase it- as property, for instance, appreciates in value. When you use stopping meditation, you can increase the value of your life. This inevitably returns us to a place of peace.

Experience this while making love. Stop what you are doing for ten seconds, separate the moment into its component parts, select one part of the moment and peer deeply into it. Maybe it is the look in your beloved’s eyes. Maybe it is a sensation you are feeling- or creating. Just stop for a tiny moment and appreciate that moment in a singular way.

We can have regular times when we do this, and making love is one of them. Standing in the shower is another. Eating food is another. Pick up a pea from the plate, or a kernel of corn. Consider it. Appreciate it. Taste it utterly and completely. Your meal times will never be the same. Your showers will never be the same. Your lovemaking will never be the same. You will never be the same.
