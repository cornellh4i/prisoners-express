**“Blink of an Eye” by Jennifer Black**

I was a good little girl with a family that really loved me. When my father got drunk, he beat my mother and when she wasn’t home, he would molest me. My father hung himself. I never stopped loving my father and I forgive him. I used to see my mother and father get high while I was growing up. I didn’t think it was a bad thing until forty years later when I ended up in prison for a robbery charge because I didn’t have any more money to get high.

I lost three out of four of my kids. I lost so much out of my life. The worst thing of all that I lost was the birth of my first and only grandson. I’m going home soon, and plan to do the right things and try to make up for the things that i have done and missed.

I can’t go back to my old ways, I can lose more or I can die. I can lose everything in a Blink of an eye.
