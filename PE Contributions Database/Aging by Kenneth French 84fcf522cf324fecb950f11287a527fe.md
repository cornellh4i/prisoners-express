**"Aging" by Kenneth French**

Some twenty odd years ago I was a young boy in 4th or 5th grade at Ryan elementary school in Bronson, M.I. Both the school and the town are quite unremarkable in that they are very small and, by today's standards, somewhat dated. In no way am I suggesting that those are bad things for a school or a town. I have many fond memories of both, to include a few of the teachers I had as a child, which brings me to the point of my intended subject on the topic of "aging."

It was around this time period, 4ht or 5th grade, that I had the great fortune of having a terrific music teacher named Mrs. Ward. I remember her as a very happy middle-age lady, slightly on the soft side, with a joy for music that infected me to no end.

It was also around this time that I was first made aware of censorship. To say I didn't like or agree with it would be an understatement. I was to the point of committing serious offenses against our principal's office, car, or house in the form of black paint and/or eggs. My best friend and I hatched many scenarios to exact our retribution and revenge not only for ourselves but for Mrs. Ward also. (None of which came to pass by the way.)

What was it that caused a child of 11 or so to get so angry? Two songs. One was "Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog." The lyrics of which are suggestive towards drinking and fornication. I'll grant that it probably wasn't all that wise to teach such a song to 10-12 year-olds, but damn it, it was a fun song!

That was one. The other, which, yes, finally has something to do with our topic, is the theme song for the TV series "M.A.S.H.". I don't know its title or artist. I'm doing good just to remember the one verse and chorus! I know just about everyone has heard the music for the song. Many of you may not know it had lyrics, also. Again, probably not suitable for teaching young children, but even at that age, I knew it was serious and not to be taken lightly. Here are the lyrics I remember:

```

The sword of time
Will pierce our skin.
It doesn't hurt
When it begins,
But as it works
It's way on in
The pain grows stronger
Watch it grin.

Suicide is dangerous.
It brings on many changes.
And I can take or leave it,
If I please.

```

Let me explain that Mrs. Ward didn't just give us the words to sing and leave us to figure out their meaning. She explained their symbolism, told us what this or that meant, cautioned us that taking a life, your own or someone else's, was something we should all avoid doing. She let us ask questions, and, for myself at least, treated us as real people who could think, understand, and discuss a topic of such a serious nature. I still have the utmost respect for that woman and an equal amount of disdain for the principal that forced her to stop allowing us to sing those sings and crediting us with the ability to think for ourselves.

Anyway, the lyrics in the song obviously speak of aging and the pains associated with it. Mrs. Ward said she thought the "sword" symbolized cancer and the "grin" was the grim reaper enjoying the prospect of the coming death. Then and now I believe it means, plain and simply, getting' older hurts, sometimes in ways we don't expect.

The chorus? Just what it says. Almost everyone has the choice to end his or her own life, but before doing so we should realize that many, many people would be affected by that choice. Sure, with the billions of people on this planet one more or less really shouldn't mater much, right? I don't know, maybe. But if you aren't around how are you going to know for sure if you wouldn't have made that difference, that little something, in someone's life?

Yes, there are many aches and pains associated with aging. The reverse is also true; there are many wonderful joys and pleasures to be experienced in life, also. Stick around and see what you can make of tomorrow. Maybe you can be the one to put a smile on someone's face and a song or two in their heart. Strive to make the word a better place in all you do and others will follow your example.
