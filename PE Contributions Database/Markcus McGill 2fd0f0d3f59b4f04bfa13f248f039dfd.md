Growing up, I always found ways to make money. Besides criminal activity, I’d shovel snow and cut grass, and I even helped a friend with a paper route. Yet, payments were cash and without taxes. The chance of a real job came from Miss Teacher in fifth hour computer class who announced an opportunity for a fall job. Attractive hours, last football practice over at four, arrive to work by five, off at ten with plenty of time to roam the streets.

I was taught that a job is guaranteed money. American Dream, triple beams and schemes: no taxes, create your own hours, fast money, and double initial investment. Nothing is promised in the streets: top of the world in one minute, lose your shoes the next. Employment, though, is table income. Motivated by opportunity, dollars, and experience, I completed an application, created a resume, and convinced Miss Teacher and Coach to be references.

The seasonal job was Crossroads Village, a family entertainment attraction. Hired on the spot! The theme of the park was Halloween, and everyone was expected to wear some sort of costume. The grounds design, devilish in nature, included building structures on the trick-or-treat routes that were haunted with ghost sounds, creepy decor, and employees with painted faces waiting to surprise kids at every turn. A souvenir shop, two eateries, and a ferris wheel were also on the property. The main attraction, a train boarded with tons of kids, and cruised through a murky forest.

A small one-bed room wooden home built in the 19th century, with a ramp attached, was my station. Inside were dated fixtures: old fashioned writing desk, wood stove, straw bed, wood dining room table, and wood floors. The sunset, and the attic was off limits. The atmosphere was uncomfortably dark, and sitting on the porch, we passed out the large supply of bite-sized Almond Joys to kids. My costume was original: a brown tweed suit, hat, and brown feather boots. The vision was a vagabond, and few kids got it. My partner was a kid from a different high school and just painted his face.

I must admit that after three long days, I was ready to quit. The job was mechanical like a textbook. For excitement, I began to toss handfuls of candy in bags instead of the required one piece. Lonely lunch breaks were spent meandering for trills. Heavily under the influence of marijuana and filled from the fried donut ball and apple cider free to employees, plus two cheeseburgers, fries, and an elephant ear with powdered sugar, a woman asked for a light. I hurried off realizing it was minutes passed my lunch break. The fourth day, during lunch, the woman returned my lighter and asked if I would join their “group of women” table. Surprised I was 15, they were interested in me, and I later explored the possibility of dating a cider woman. From that day forward, those were my lunch buddies, especially my new friend. Although the job was easy, had free boxes of candy (OK, OK, I was selling candy but only one box a night), and was with a cute woman, 20 years my senior and a crush on me, it wasn’t enough for me to stay. The plan was to pick up my check and never return.

The six days were colorless. The strong desire for something refreshing was unfulfilled. Lunch, the livest hour, provided intellectual conversation that captured my attention only for a moment. Come Saturday, I was going to blow this joint. No goodbyes, no farewells.

One hundred, seventy-five dollars. Not bad for one week of nothing. No second thoughts about departure. I greeted the familiar faces and left. Almost in the parking lot, thinking about what I was going to get into until a soft voice stopped me dead in my tracks. Oh! She was a beautiful new employee who asked where the office was. I introduced myself and sparked a conversation while leading her to the office. All of a sudden, the idea of abandoning ship was postponed. Finally, a purpose to stay. A new plan: make the new girl smile.
