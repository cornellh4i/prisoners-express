**“You Don’t Deserve Help” by Robert Johan Richter**

Hello, People of Earth! Prepare yourselves for another deprecating hate screed! You want help? I have been trying to help you for eight years, spent far too much money on postage, countless hours writing, for what? I can’t help you because you are all too ignorant and arrogant; greedy, lazy, and stupid. Earth is populated by poorly programmed chatbots, not rational, intelligent beings. Why should I help?

Students pay a hundred thousand dollars or more to be taught “physics” at Cornell and other Ivy League universities, but it’s a scam. Science is based on facts and logic. The physics taught at Cornell is based on Maxwell’s electromagnetism. Where in his equations is the term for the protons? Nope, he died in 1879, forty years before they were discovered. A moment’s thought reveals that his “magnetic” vector doesn’t come from one electric vector, it’s the difference between what two separate electric fields, positive and negative, are doing.

Where’s my Nobel Prize? I’m the only physicist on Earth, doing REAL physics, but your ignorance blocks all of my efforts to help you. The unmitigated arrogance of fools is the other half of the problem. You think that you are better than me, that your college degrees and freedom allow you to decide what is real and thus ignore the facts, because I, a mere prisoner, pointed them out?

Are you even alive, are you real? For eight long years I have tried to help the people of Earth. I have failed miserably. Some people have stated that they can’t/won’t help me, but that is an evil position. Millions of people are wasting their lives. Don’t they deserve the truth? If I had a cure for cancer, would you kill millions, just to hold me back? Yes, you would, you would let them die, and never care. Each wasted day for a million people is the exact same as wasting 33 entire lives, more than 12,000 people per year, about 100,000 people in eight years.

God’s curse is upon you. What kind of monster destroys that many lives? Why should I keep trying to help out? So far as I can see, every single human being, except for myself, is a soulless monster. Who am I supposed to be helping, anyway? It’s not that one or two people are hurting a thousand others. I have written to more than a thousand people, yet not one is stopping this atrocity. How can you dare ask Him for help, when you refuse to help anyone else?

So I quit. Maybe, by the time you read this, somebody will have awakened you from his trance, but then again, I thought that years ago. Face it, you are a mindless animal, pathetic and useless. What help do you deserve? A stronger cage? The Universe doesn’t need you. Good bye.
