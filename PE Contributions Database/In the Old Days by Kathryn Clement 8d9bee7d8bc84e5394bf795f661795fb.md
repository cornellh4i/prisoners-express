**In the Old Days by Kathryn Clement**

- It was free, not out to get me

-Life without lying, stealing, right under your nose

-Friends treat you not as an enemy

-Work was fun and not harmful

-There was integrity, trust, honesty, life without pretense

-Bell-bottom pants, clothes that were comfortable, not make you look fat or couldn’t wear because you are a big beautiful woman

-Allowed to have freedom of speech, religion (Jesus); not shut down because you’re different...
