**“The Mission” by Michael B. Willis**

I was trained to be a soldier.

I became known as the “black sheep.”

An outcast, who was cast out

because I refused to react as an

“automation” who is dead to everything

except following orders, including the

truth.

This guy on my shoulder (my company commander)

was my assignment: I was to extract him

from the enemy encampment

(alive if possible).

I found him in the next to

last cell in the compound

balled up like a 6 month old fetus

mumbling “I don’t want to die…

“I don’t want to die

“I don’t want to die,”

in between tears and licks of his thumb.

So I burped and shouldered the bastard

(just before this photo was taken).

Upon return to our unit,

I sat him in front of Company Headquarters

and walked away

without responding to any of his unintelligible remarks.
