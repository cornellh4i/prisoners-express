**Nourishment by Jack Simpson**

Our cafeteria had been inspected and shut down due to various violations. It has been a blessing in a way. Food here has improved since another institution is  preparing it. Boiled eggs is something we will have to live with. I, like the rest of the people in here,  had our share of egg salad sandwiches.

Since the food has gotten a lot better, I even venture to eat there once in a while. This is in no way putting down the people who work  there. It is that there are some places that none of you would want to visit again. I feel the same way about this place. If I can fix it myself then I would rather do that.

I will not say that the food here doesn’t have any value to it. It does. To a degree. Only if you like a lot of starch in your body. We all know what that will do to your body. What isn’t  burned by the body due to activity anyway. It will be stored as sugar in the cells. Later on in life that causes medical problems. I should know, since I am one of the few who is border-line diabetic.

Since I have to watch certain foods that I eat,  I have learned that the old saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” is true after all. So what will oatmeal do for me ?

When I see Collard Greens, carrots, corn, or any type of vegetables, I really am game. If you want to see a smile on my face, let me see a tossed salad. Guess I am part rabbit. I have not met anyone who doesn’t love a good salad or Mac and Cheese. I also really love beans. Kidney or speckled butter beans are my favorite.  I must have a cake of cornbread to go with my beans.

I still have not figured out the turkey smoked sausage we got here. A few years ago, I cut one down the middle, placed it in the microwave for about 4 minutes and once it was removed, I pushed both ends together and all I ended up with was dust. It must be because of all the chemical products that they put in the meat. I see no meat at all.

One thing I can say about all of this is that we must all be careful of what is placed in our bodies, because it matters. I don’t buy cookies, sweet cakes, or just junk food.I love ice cream, but I have to be careful. I don’t want to end up in the hospital and in a comma.

When I think about placing any food in my mouth , I look for ways to make that food nourishing. I am getting older, and I need all the help I can get to keep things going. I have much to live for.
