**"Boys Smoking"** **by Norman Theriot**

In looking back on my life I often wonder where the time has gone. Exactly where did I go wrong? I have lived all of these years, yet it seems that I have accomplished nothing. I have not succeeded, I have regressed, I have fallen into the charm of a broken heart, bridled by dreams that were just that--dreams.

Oh, I can remember setting goals in life--some attainable, some unrealistic. Some of these goals I achieved only to end up throwing away all that I had accomplished. Other goals I gave up on prematurely when I should have trudged on, seeking victory and the satisfaction of accomplishment.

I never really paid attention to the big picture. Instead, I lived for the moment, not giving any thought to where the future might head. Drugs will do that to you. I’ve taken everything for granted, and never did I realize that everything could be lost within the blink of an eye. I had failed to realize that I always took the simple things in life for granted; they require maintenance or they will fade away. These simple things are what I miss the most since they are no longer available to me. Things like the love of one’s spouse and children, friendships, the ability to take a simple bath, walks in the park. Or just laying around at night looking at the stars, contemplating the beginning and end of space.

Now I look at where I am today--locked away for a crime that I committed, paying my debt to society. But even here, life goes on. I have options and am still left with choices to make which will ultimately decide how I live my life tomorrow and after I am released. I could sit here and feel sorry for myself and let the days go of their own accord doing nothing to better myself. Looking like these boys in the picture living to be high, delinquent from society, I can do all of the things that are detrimental to my regaining then maintaining my freedom.

Or I can choose to change the way that I think and act. I can enroll and actively participate in the programs that the system offers. I can further my education. Knowledge equates power and is mandatory in the world outside these walls of concrete and steel. I can work hard to not add to the grim statistics on recidivism.

I now realize I have control over my life; all is not lost. Today is the day for change since tomorrow may be too late. New beginnings must not be put off. Procrastination breeds failure which I can no longer endure. I am not designed to be in a cage, and so I strive to overcome, to succeed where so many others have failed, to break the chains that have for so long held me back in life. It is up to me to take the first step to change my life. I must incorporate the tools needed to change the direction of my life and be what the Creator meant for me to be. I now realize that there is hope no matter how dismal the situation, no matter what the circumstances. I can overcome if I think before I act.

It is true that life is what you make it. With this in mind, I strive to live life to the fullest, to enjoy what I have and to seek peace and happiness in all that I do.
