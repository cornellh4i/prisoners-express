**"Reading" by Daniel Alvarez**

Reading a lot is one of the most important things you can do in life. I used to be big on numbers when I was in high school. Now I read and write all the time, and I have a deeper appreciation for reading. Books take my imagination to places I’ve never thought of before. It’s very true that books are better than the movie, and I love movies. I go twice a week. Books are the cornerstone of education. So if you want to educate yourself, read more. I read books so I can get an idea of how to write books. I also read books to prepare for “Jeopardy”, and let me tell you it has been an awesome ride. I said I used to be more of a numbers guy, yet now I’ve learned to always make time for reading, even if it’s just an hour. As I read books on psychology I’ve become able to notice bad habits and stop them. When I read a book on philosophy I feel as if I have found a new home and a world that understands what I want out of life. So, I’ve gone to the beginning of philosophy and started reading Plato’s The Republic and Other Dialogues. I hope to go down the path of learning philosophy and learn to answer life’s existential questions. I hope to continue to read books to become a well-read individual. Oh, and to prepare for “Jeopardy” of course. I really encourage you to read mostly educational books. I want to become a doctor, and I’ve always been part of man’s search for knowledge. Reading has helped me fulfill that dream. The more I read the better I become at it, and the more I begin to use my dictionary. It’s good to keep a college-level dictionary nearby. As I plan to read all year long I can only imagine how much smarter I’ll be in a year, or five for that matter. Oddly enough prison has given me the time and opportunity to read, and yet in no way is prison any fun.
