**"Woman in Black" by Uriel Perez**

Looking at this significant image of a universal symbol of agony, pain, and a sense of Death. Not too much as the direct victim but the hurt of his loved ones, those nearest and dearest. Just how that, Death, is the densest and complete apex in the form of harm that can be inflicted. How many more ways can I, we, as a species, inflict harm, hurt, pain, or other lesser forms of destruction unto others? To ourselves?

An insult can be a disturbance to the ego, instability to the emotions but with formal forgiveness and ignorance it can be remedied. A physical attack can become some minor injury, black eye(s) or bruises, at it’s worst an impaired body part; broken jaw, nose, etc… With periodic episodes of pain but again, with treatment and time, it will alleviate. It can also cause a permanent dysfunction but Death, the cessation of existence, the leaving of this earth an a permanence absent in life. Just that, infinite harm without remedy.

In this, I see not only the harm inflicted on a person but it ripples unto their loved ones. Once I heard it said, “we are made by those who surround us.” For those of us who are blessed with a family, they are us. In this, I perceive how hurt travels on and it’s felt on those around my victims. That intangible, unrelieved pain but yet very existing and felt emotional and psychological scarring ever-present and over lived. How deep and fracturing can it be? Then I think, that’s the same pain I inflict unto me, my family, my loved ones.

In my self-centeredness and most vile ignorance of the world for my own desires; I have caused harm. That same intangible, unphysical attack or scarring but well inflicted and overtime well rooted into the souls and minds of mines. How those times I would pursue a high or a thrill, in an unseen way living a suicidal way of life. I would inflict worry and deception. Times of isolation and disintegration once and for all, a final pain of Death would be easier to live with for mines rather than this elongated pain.

How do I know they hurt? For now, I feel my own hurt. Alone in this cell, I see and feel just that. Alone. The pain has been relieved to my family by detaching from me. My infliction. My dreams and desires, unattained. A future unseen, although, my Higher Power is with me and now I conceive. Death has not manifested, therefore, all is repairable, healable, it can be alleviated. We are alive, we treat others and ourselves.
