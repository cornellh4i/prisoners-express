**Animal by Gerald Durst**

David’s yak stood saddled and ready. It’s hard to believe that it is July. The polar shift of 2050 had left the Earth all screwed up. The season’s had completely changed. Christmas was now in the beginning of summer instead of winter. Fourth of July fireworks in the snow.

David’s yak came from a small herd that a rancher in Colorado had kept. They are hardy beasts that tolerate cold pretty well. It didn’t take too long to get past the musky smell of their body’s once you got on board.

David isn’t a very tall fellow, no more than 5’5”, but he is well built. You’d have to be these days with all the competition from other villages and maranders vieins for resources. He’s a good looking fellow with his lantern jaw, hazel eyes, and blondish hair.

With his rifled mushel in hand, and a cap and ball pistol in his waistband, he looked into Stacy’s eyes, “I’ll be back before you know it”.

Her blue eyes, worry etched into them and her face, looked into his. “I hate it every time you have to go”.

“Don’t you worry too much. You’ve got the boys with you, and we won’t be gone long” He said to his nervous wife. “It’s my turn in the patrol rotation. This one will be short unless we get hit with some snow”.

“I know,” she said as a single tear slipped free. “I just worry so much every time you go. What with the raving gangs and the patrol from the other villages. I don’t want you getting killed in a skirmish”.

“I’ll be fine. Ugly will see me home safe”. He patted his yak as he said this. Then he looked down at his two sons. He opened his arms and the 11 and 9 year old boys rushed into them.

“I love you, Joseph and Daniel. You boys take care of your mom, and keep things going while I’m gone”.

Joseph, a tow herd, strapping young man, for he took after his dad in this muscle department, looked at his father with a brave look on his young face. “I’ll make sure everything is done right, Dad”.

“I know you will, son. Just as I know that, you, Daniel, will do your part as best you can”.

“Yes, sir” said the brown haired 9 year old. He stood awkwardly as his body didn’t quite line up. He had been born with kyphoscoliosis which meant his spine was slightly twisted with the @-curve of scoliosis, and a hunch from the kyphosis.

In spite of this, the little boy worked hard. He tried not to let the pains in his back stop him or slow him down. Sadly, his body was weak, and muscles building just did not come easy for him, yet, the little fella was game.

“I’ll make ya proud of me, pa” Daniel said.

With a big smile, a swelled breast full of love, he tossed the boys hair, “I’m already proud of both you boys”.

“I’ll also make sure Tommy Tomleson doesn’t bother him” said Joseph.

David smiled as he took Stacy into his arms. “You better come home safe,” she whispered in his ear. “I don’t plan to raise 3 children on my own”.

He whipped back holding her shoulders at arms length, his eyes as big as saucers. “You’re serious?!”

She nods her head with a smile that wraps around and meets behind her long dark hair.

With a whoop, David picks Stacy up and gives her a whirl. “Hey Fellas!” he bellows, “I’m gonna be a dad again!”

Cheers arise from the other men in the patrol as wives and sweethearts and daughters surround Stacy with warmth and love and giggles.

David gives Stacy one last long, lingering kiss. Then, grinning like a food, he orders the patrol to “saddle up”.

“Alright, boys!” Daniel yells, “Let’s get this over with. We got family to get back to”.

A heartfelt cheer goes up as the 12 men head out to ensure the safety of their own little village.
