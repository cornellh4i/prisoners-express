**"Holidays in America" by Daniel Alvarez**

The holidays are awesome. Every holiday has a song. So learn them. In America, we ring in the new year. Around Christmas, we spread the Christmas cheer. At Halloween, everybody participates in the festivities or suffers the consequences at the hands of tricksters. In America, we celebrate Thanksgiving, where we gather with friends and family. We eat from the year’s harvest and watch NFL football. On Mother’s and Father’s Day, we give presents. We have St. Patrick’s Day, and the closer you live to the east coast the more you celebrate it. On Labor Day some people have barbecues, yet the truth is that the majority of people work on Labor Day. Barbecues are for Memorial Day or the 4th of July. Yet on the 4th of July, most cities host a fireworks show, and the bigger the city the bigger the fireworks show. There’s St. Valentine’s Day where men buy roses and wine and dine their girlfriends. Flower shops make a ton of money on this day. To some people leap year, February 29th is also a holiday. In America, if you do something great for the country, we celebrate your birthday. There’s Martin Luther King’s Day and President’s Day. I wonder when August 4th will be a holiday, celebrating the 44th president of the United States Barack H. Obama. One day that can make it be a holiday is the Super Bowl. Yes, NFL’s Super Bowl is already technically Cinco de Mayo which is actually a Mexican holiday. In America, we have freedom of Religion. So there are days that are celebrated like Hanukkah, and Ramadan. There are also holidays that apply only to the state and city you are in. Yes, America has a lot of great holidays. So I got to tell you my favorite of them all, Halloween. Yes, All Hallow’s eve. It is the official cosplay day.
