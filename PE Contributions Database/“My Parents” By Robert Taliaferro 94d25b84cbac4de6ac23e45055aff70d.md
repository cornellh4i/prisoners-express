**“My Parents” By Robert Taliaferro**

With a subject like this, I often wonder what other prisoners might write.

It seems that when you talk about parents inside of a prison, they tend to be either the perfect people, or they are drug addicted, absent, or perfectly insane.

My parents, at least one of them, were enigmatic. My biological mother died shortly after I was born. She was only sixteen. My biological father decided that I was better off with her parents for the first two years of my life, and I always tell people that those were the only years of my early life where I actually felt love.

My stepmother was the quintessential black mother from the 1950s and 1960s. She dealt with me per her marriage to the sperm donor who called himself my father, but in 20/20 hindsight, I could tell that she was not that comfortable having to deal with “someone else’s” child.

When she had her own “oldest son” then the ice broke a little, but not much to be recognized as total acceptance.

My father, the sperm donor, plan and simple was a drunk. Not only that, he was a mean drunk and a coward who, today, would have been arrested for any number of criminal actions, but in those days of children--and wives--being seen and not heard, it was open season.

The sperm donor wasn’t all bad though. He left his scotch in plain sight so that I could steal a sip every now and then in the time I was 14 until I graduated from High School and joined the Army.

He taught me how to deal with pain on many levels and how to take disappointment and accept it without crying, or at least wishing that I could gain things that were unattainable--at least as far as he was able to ascertain, because as far as he was concerned, I would probably fail at anything that I tried.

He taught me how to turn hatred into action; and anger into idealism.

It was interesting that after my stepmother and I compared notes many years later, I was also to find that he was insecure in many ways as well. We both figured that he had played us against each other so that we would never become allies and be able to team up against him.

We both realized that he was a narcissist and misogynist who tried to destroy anything that could be better than he was. One would think that most parents would want their children to achieve more than they have in life and that they would be supportive of that concept. The sperm donor, we decided, if he could, would have created all sorts of situations to insure that his children, especially his oldest son, would be a failure.

So when I think of my parents, I think of the young woman who was conned into having a child at 15 or 16 and who was robbed of life and the ability to spend time with her son. I think of years of abuse and neglect; tortures of a drunk who thought that it was his right to punish his children in ways that were criminal, but he knew that he could get away with it because children of a certain generation did not have any voice.

I think of extremely talented, creative children who, if he had been more secure in his manhood, would have done great things in their lives. Most of all, I think of how hard it was to raise myself and to embark on a lifetime of trial and error before I was finally able to find myself.

There is one thing that I can thank my parents for however; they taught me how to be a different parent than they were, so that when I had children of my own, I knew exactly what not to do.

I learned how to nurture my children, how to support them in their efforts to be individuals...to be unique. I was able to teach them how to be parents for their children, how to love and respect them as being more than just children, but more importantly, small human beings who have rights and who deserve dignity, and honor, and the ability to grow into the adults that they are destined to become if they are given the right guidance, support, and love.

Most of all, I had to learn how to forgive, if I was ever going to become anything but a person who took the sins of the past and allowed them to define all that I would become in the present and future.

I wonder sometimes, if my life would have been much better had I come from the perfect loving family. Then I look into the mirror and see how far I have come and know how far I wish to go in life, despite being confined, and I am somehow glad that I had the upbringing that I had for it built character, and inner strength, and calluses on my spirit that I might not have been able to grow otherwise.

So, I suppose that I have one other thing that I can thank my parents for...I would not be the evolved man that I am today, had I not had to wade through the waters of life that I had to deal with when I was a child. When people try to appease me by acting as if they pity my young life, I tend to look at them with disdain. I don’t ask for their pity, or sympathy, or any of that.

Had it not been for that hard life that I once had, I would not be able to deal with the situation that I find myself in today. When I look in the mirror, I don’t see a reflection of my parents… I just see a person who I actually have learned to like...all I see is me.
