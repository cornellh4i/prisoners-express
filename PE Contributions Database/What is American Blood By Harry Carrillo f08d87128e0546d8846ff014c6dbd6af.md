**What is American Blood By Harry Carrillo**

When you spend 22 hours a day celled with another person, no conversational stone goes unturned. Somehow my celly and I got onto the subject of race. Though born in the U.S., he professed his loyalty to Mexico and what he called ‘His People.’ Like most minorities in the prison system, he expressed a sort of enmity with the white race. Unbeknownst to him, I am half white, and the conversation sparked into a heated debate. After an hour or so of splitting hairs my celly demanded to know what race I identify with, if not Mexican? “ I am American,” I say. He brushed away that answer and explained rather sarcastically that there was no such thing. “I know what Mexican blood is,” he said, thumping his chest. “But what is American blood?”

It is a question that the modern American would brush off as non-existent. We tend to describe our Nation as a Melting Pot; a nation of immigrants comprised of any and all peoples who share her ideals and wish to achieve the American Dream. This definition describes an all-inclusive society bound not by ethnicity, but shared political institutions. My celly’s argument rests on the premise that Mexico’s racial ethnicity and national identity are synonymous, whereas America can be defined by nationalization only.

The idea that the U.S. is a raceless Nation is relatively new. French essayist John Crevecoeur (1735-1813) posed the famous question “What is an American, this New Man?” His answer: “A mixture of English, Scottish, Irish, French, German, and Swedes… He is either a European or the descendant of Europeans.”

The Naturalization Act of 1790 gave us our first definition of an American, restricting the process of becoming a citizen to free white persons only. Between 1790 and 1980, the white race made up between eighty to ninety percent of the population. The original thirteen colonies were founded and settled by Europeans. Those who fought for our independence, framed our constitution, and built from the ground up what was to become one of the most powerful nations in the history of Western civilization were either of Anglo-Saxon or Western European descent.

To assert that there is no such thing as ‘American blood’ because we all come from immigrants is absurd. To deny that the racial identity of America as the Celto-Germanic Stock of Europe is equivalent to denying the racial identity of Mexico as a mixture of indigenous Meso-Americans and their Spanish conquerors.

The question is this: If within the next decade there are Mass Migrations of, let’s say, Syrians and Ethiopians into Mexico, for example, would the country then need deny its cultural and racial origins to accommodate the newly settled migrants? Could we call these people Mexican, and if so, is there a difference between the national and racial identity of Mexico’s Mestizo and non-Mestizo constituants? We should certainly think so. We do not suggest that these new citizens are not equal to their countrymen. Nor should their Non-Mestizo make up bump them to a second class status. We merely make the point to illustrate a distinction.

Some might ask “What about those who serve their country, militarily or otherwise, who are not of so-called American blood?” To this we say that those who serve their country are the first to deserve its liberties; but that does not negate our point. The disconnect is that America is no longer a racially homogeneous nation. The history of our democracy is offensive to certain members of our society. The idea of a white America brings to mind segregation and the promotion of racial superiority as a pass to exploit slave labor.

Yet, we must remember that historically man has always been tribal and subject to the ideas of his era; no matter how radical. Every conquering nation at one time or another has justified their conquest from a point of superiority (racial, religious, political, etc.). We denounce colonization and America’s early role in the slave trade, yet we are silent about the imperial ambition of the Ashanti who conquered neighboring tribes and sold them to Whites for gunpowder.

The difference in subjugating a neighboring tribe and an alien people half a world away is technological advancement. Nothing more. There is no moral high ground here.

We deny White America in her history because it does not represent the diversity that it does today. We fear that in recognizing the root of an American proper would be to denote non-Caucasian constituents to second class status, which is nonsense. Therefore, we disenfranchise the White American in his history.

It is not racist for Whites to be proud of their American heritage and their ancestors’ role in creating our nation. When foreigners immigrate to America, we are to respect their history, heritage, and religion. This is called integrity. We, as Americans, deserve that same respect.
