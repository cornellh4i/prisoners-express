**“Lily Swan & Red Fox: Raid” by Mark Sandfox**

****Red Fox licked his lips as he sniffed around Lilly’s nest.

“Don’t you even think about it Red,” honked Lilly Swan, “You are not having any of my eggs for breakfast, nor will they be used as ammunition for your raid this evening.”

“But they won’t hatch,” whimpered Red Fox, “They never do.”

“And you can have the leftovers… *after* the others hatch.”

Red sat back on his haunches, it was the best offer he had ever received. Lilly was overly protective of her eggs, always was and always would be. If Sam were still around, Red would have received a good pecking just for broaching the subject.

“Who will watch your eggs this evening?” asked Red innocently.

Lily eyeballed him with a hiss.

“I am not planning on stealing your eggs,” barked Red, “I only want to be sure they are protected.”

Have you ever heard a goose harrumph? “Maggie Mallard and her clutch.”

“Well they are certainly loud enough.”

“Yes they are, and if they so much as quack once, all bets are off, your raid is a wash… agreed?”

“Most certainly,” yipped Redm “You brood is far more important.”

“Good. Then you best be off to plan everything. And don’t forget to put that wicker baby carriage in the middle for all to see.” With that Lilly Swan tucked her bill under her left wing.

Later that evening they waited in the tall grass. Red had been very busy recruiting his raiding party. The first headlights approached. Lilly Lake hushed. Only the breezy rustle of tall grass broke the silence. Even the shrill of crickets were absent on this suspenseful night. The wicker baby carriage stood ominous in the glow of the approaching headlights. Then another pair of headlights approached, the carriage shone brighter, then another and another. Car doors slammed, it was ike flies to a bug-light, the young humans gathered around the carriage. Soon the quiet night was alive with the murmurs of young humans, laughing and yelling, drinking and smooching, running and frolicking. The lake watched. The trees watched, The tall grass waited. If you poked at the tension in the air with a stick, it would have broke.

Red gave the signal, a single yip. Instantly the murmurs were overwhelmed by hinks, quacks, caws, and screeches, the air force was in the air.

“EEEEEWWWW”’s filled the night as the skunks flanked the young humans, corralling them into a tight huddle. Bombs were dropped from the night sky, unhatched rotting eggs and seagull turds.

More distressed “EEEWWWs.” The huddle tried to disburse, tried to break fort heir cars. The skunks sprayed, opossums hissed, raccoons chattered, and a cougar roared. The young humans huddled tighty together once more.

The land assault was more in every way. Beaver tails flung mug, swamp muck, feces. The skunks turned into foundations of stink. Muskrats sat atop proud bucks whose rasks were strung with bras, flinging God only knows what into the crying screaming huddle.

One last aerial from gulls, finches, owls, hawks, pigeons, starlings, doves, even the eagle couple and their young from two lakes over added their excrement to the raining shower.

Lily nudged Red with her wing. Enough was enough, Red yipped, low and piercing. Obediently, all the animals of the lake, trees and grassland retreated back to their homes. There was much revelry and caterwauling as they faded into the night.

The earlier “Eeews” were now replaced with crying and whimpering, but the young humans would not budge from their huddle. Lilly Swan and Red Fox sat side by side feeling quite vindicated, yet oddly protective of the young humans. Thy watched and waited until the last car door slammed, until the last tail light blinked out in the night, before they walked and waddled, side by side, back to Lilly Swan’s nest.
