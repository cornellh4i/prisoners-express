**“Grieving Widow” by Bobby Parris**

On a wet rainy day in May of 1942, the Smith family is coming from the farm feeding the animals. Edna and Cleveland stay outside playing in the rain; having a fun time. The mother, Juanette, tells them to come on in and wash up for dinner. They come in, washup, and get ready for dinner. As they all gather around the dinner table, the phone rings. Juanette asks one of the kids to get it. Cleveland picks up the phone and says Hellos. A man on the other side of the call asks for Mr. Smith. Cleveland calls for his dad. George picks up the phone and he says, “Hello?”. The man says to Mr. Smith,

“We need you to fight for your country”. Mr. Smith was unaware of the question or statement that was given to him, but he says,

“Okay, when will I leave?”. He tells him May 12th. Mr. Smith looks at the calendar and says, “That’s just days away”. The man says,

“We know and we apologize for such short notice. We hope you will be ready at that time.” George agrees and thanks the man for his call. They both hang up the phone. As George sets the receiver down, his wife asks who was on the phone. He says that they want him to fight in the war. She pauses for a minute. Wanting to say when will you leave, but he says it before she can get it out. She tells him to do whatever he can to stay alive and come home safe.

On his departure date, May 12th, all the families gather at the base to say their final goodbyes to their family members. Moments later, they all load the plane to leave. George looks back one more time to wave to his family. His kids are standing in the saluting position. He salutes them back and loads up. As they arrive at their destination, everyone is splitting up in the branches. He got recruited by the Air Force, along with 300 other soldiers. Every day, he would write home, letting his family know how things are; knowing that he is in the air 75% of the time, fighting. On every holiday, he would call home and speak to his family: he tries to fight back his tears when he talks to them, especially when he hears his kids say,

“Daddy when are you coming home? We miss you and love you.” He tells them that he doesn’t know.

“We are constantly fighting. We don’t know how long it’s going to last.”

On December 25, 1943, while Edna and Cleveland are opening their Christmas present and Juanette is in the kitchen washing dishes, they hear a knock on the door. Thinking it’s some family coming with more presents for the kids, Edna goes to the door and opens it. As she opens it, Juanette is coming out of the kitchen with her towel in her hand. She asks who it is. Edna doesn’t speak. She just runs to her mother, tears in her eyes. Her mother asks,

“What is wrong?” As she gets closer to the door, she notices two soldiers are standing on the front porch asking for Mrs. Smith. Juanette says,

“That’s me. Can I help you two find gentlemen?”. They hand her Mr. Smith’s air force hat and she breaks into a sob as she realizes what has just happened. The soldiers are still standing in the doorway trying to comfort Mrs. Smith as other relatives pull up to the driveway. At once, they notice the army vehicle and they start rushing to the door expecting to see George. As they get to the door, they hear Juanette crying and also notice two soldiers standing there. Two months later, at the funeral, they played the song “American Soldier” by Toby Keith with other soldiers at the funeral.
