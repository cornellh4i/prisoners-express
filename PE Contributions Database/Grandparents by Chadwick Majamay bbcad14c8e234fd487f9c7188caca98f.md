Grandparents by Chadwick Majamay

Who chooses one’s grandparents? Or even one’s parents to which we are born? No one! We are united into one’s life once we are born; our grandparents. Whether we are physically present with one’s grandparents or not, whether we had adopted them by choice in our lives, they are still with us, association by name and/or by choice.

I had never known my grandfather from my father’s side of my family, but knew and grew up with my grandmother from my mother’s side of my gigantic family. Throughout the short time I was in her life until the age of 9 when she had passed away from breast cancer, she had imprinted into my life values in which her mother instilled into her as a young child.

One... never be ashamed of who you are! Celebrate it! I remember the times we used to sing for my cousins, uncles, and aunties every night since I was 6 years of age until she passed on from this life. I loved singing! More so with my grandmother! The last time we sang together was at her funeral to the tune of “We Are Ohana” by the Hawaiian style band. As I sang, she and I were one, a treasured gift she left with me and one I will always treasure. And...

Two! Celebrate life with others! That means EVERYTHING and EVERYONE! Including those who hurt me and made enemies of me. “Celebrate,” for grandma, was everything that “aloha” represents in my native Hawaiian tongue. Love and care for one another, build one another up, show compassion towards another, and, most importantly, forgive one another. I remember the time a kid who scratched and scarred my face with anger. After I recuperated, I was encouraged by Grandma to reflect upon what the kid was probably going through. “I do not care,” I had said. She then said to me one thing I had never forgotten: “People hurt each other because they are hurt too.” As I wrapped my eight year old mind around what she said, I could forgive the kid who harmed me. And today?! He is my best friend! Thanks Grandma!
