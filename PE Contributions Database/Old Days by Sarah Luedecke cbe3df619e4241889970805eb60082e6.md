By Sarah Luedecke

In the old days

It was dark

I was numb

I knew a world

Without love

In the old days

It was black

I was dead

And life was dim

In the old days

I had no dreams

I had no vision

Life had no meaning

Then the old days passed

Away with time

My dark and dead eyes

Were filled with light

They were born

One by one

Each one like a star

Shooting across the skies

Gave me hope

And dreams of my own

Wishes I made

On three lives

Freed my heart from stone.
