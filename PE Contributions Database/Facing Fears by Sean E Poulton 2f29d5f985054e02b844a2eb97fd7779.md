****I learned early in my prison sentence to face my fears. There was no choice. As a child, I was raised by my mother and two older sisters. I grew up very timid and soft spoken. I had only been in a couple of actual fights, and they were usually with my friends.

My life changed in an instant on December 8, 1993. My crime was not planned, and it wasn’t meant to happen. It started as a “scoping out’ mission to see if a home was worth burgularing. It ended in a brutal murder of an innocent man only trying to defend himself and his home. I didn’t kill the man, but he died as a direct result of my actions. I got us in the house. I realize I am just as responsible. I don’t mean to minimize my part in the events of that night.

After my arrest, I was placed in a small cell block in jail. My name was all over the news, and I’m from a small town so no one really talked to me or messed with me.

I walked through the gates of Pendleton January 18, 1996. Hearing that railroad gate close behind you is nearly heartstopping.

I was placed in an 8 man dorm called A & O (Administration and Orientation). It was a cold afternoon, and my first meal was supper. The bell rang, doors came open, and people filed out in jacket and boots. Behind me was an old school dude from Michigan City Prison named Ben.

We get back to the chow hall, and guys are coming from the left and right to walk single file through the chow door. A guy on my left steps up to go in, and a guy from my right rushed past me, pulls the jack of the guy in front of me, and hits him in the ribs--hard. *Uhh*, you hear as the attacked rushes off. The victim falls in the doorway, pulls his hand away from his rib and is leaching blood. 12 inches in front of me, a man had been stabbed, two hours after walking into the prison.

I started to help him up when Ben grabbed me from behind, “Do you know him?” As I reply no, he pushes me through the door, “Then mind your business if you want to survive.”

I walk through the line on the right, shaken and so scared I want to puke.

When I get to the window, I see the opposite from me is another window with a black dude grabbing a tray. Behind and there out, the whole line is blacks. Behind me is all white. I go to the Kool-Aid stand and wait on Ben to decide where we should sit. We find a table on the right side of the chow hall where it’s all white.

I look down at my beans and corn head and realize I can’t eat. Just the Kool-Aid makes me want to vomit. “You gonna eat that?” Ben asks. I slide it over to him.

That was the beginning of my nightmare. After all these years, I’ve learned how to sit, never with both legs under the table, in case you need to get up quickly. And always sit across from a friend. Lovers sit side by side; friends sit across from each other and watch out for each other.

I heard my first rape about a month into it. I laid in bed, clutching a piece of metal and crying with the knowledge that I couldn’t help that kid without putting myself at risk.

It didn’t matter: I was at risk anyway until I proved I was not prey. I stabbed my first man within 90 days to avoid being claimed.

Every step I took was pure fear. I was in a 48 man dorm with no police and no cameras. The police came in 6 times a day to count, locked the door, and went back downstairs. My choice was taken from me. I lived in fear, and there was no escaping it. No choice but to face it. To overcome it meant being feared. So I adapted and changed to survive.

I’ve lived this way for 20+ years, and I have scars from the top of my head to my knees. I’ve had at least 8 broken bones, and the scars people see are the least of them.

Now, I don’t fear prison. This is my world. I know how to survive. Now, as the possibility of getting out approaches, I fear the real world. I am a convict now. What will I be when I get out? What will be my identity?

I have a beautiful, loving wife. Will she see things she doesn’t like in me? Can I give her and be for her all that she deserves?

I want to be loved and truly respected, not feared. I only chose that path to survive. Can I survive out there? My question now is, can we ever be completely at ease with no fear?
