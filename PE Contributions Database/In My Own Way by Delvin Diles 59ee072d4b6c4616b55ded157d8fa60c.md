**“In My Own Way” by Delvin Diles #862751**

For a long time, I’ve had a tendency to get in my own way. As a teen in a classroom for a summer theatre arts camp for delinquents, we’d been served refreshments, and I set out to be cool. Instead of drinking my Sprite like a normal person, I decided to turn mine up to chug it, thug-style. Miscalculating swallows, I choked and sputtered and coughed soda from my nose, throat and lungs. It felt fatal and stupid. A kind, petite coordinator , Ms. Lisa Schmidt, led me out to the hallway, patted my back and assured me, “You’re okay. Just a little embarrassed.”

We spent 6 weeks writing and rehearsing an abstract play, “Contents Under Pressure”. A performance in which I had a soliloquy. We would be paid $200 for 3 performances at the Dallas Museum of Arts. I ended up missing the last of the three and my check, getting blunted. Later, I found out that names were drawn and some lucky member of the cast was paid double to read my soliloquy from the stage.

Even after I ruined the play, Ms. Schmidt still tried to mentor me. Now a Director over the Creative Solutions program, she still keeps in touch, 20 years later. She wrote “I’m still fighting against the systemic racism that keeps black youth in poverty.” Thankfully, some folks refuse to be thwarted.
