My grandma was my mom. She has dark skin with brown eyes. My grandma was the backbone; she says sometimes you did it or else you get disciplined, punished, or the wooden spoon. Grandma was strong and very smart. She used to help me with my homework; if it was not for her I would have not graduated high school. Now, I love my grandma and I can’t wait to get out so to her house in Sainsville, Florida, get her cooking all that spanish food and soul food. Love Grandma; I can’t wait to go back home to grandma and Florida.
