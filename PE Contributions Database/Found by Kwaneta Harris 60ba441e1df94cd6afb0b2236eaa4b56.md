**Found by Kwaneta Harris**

Conceived through rape. Molested through childhood. Kidnapped and gang-raped during puberty. Innocence and trust lost.

Thirty years later, evil returned to visit. This time, I made a choice and was removed from my family again. All hope wasn’t lost! Just the opposite.

I found my inner strength, self value, and self love, but that wasn’t correct either. More like, I discovered what has always been there: my inner warrior. To all the surprises life has thrown at me, I no longer ask, “Why me?” Instead, “Why not me?” I can handle it.

I’m not just a survivor but also a warrior. Now, nobody has permission to make me feel weak. Being happy with the person you’ve become--priceless.
