Oh, be careful what you hear and be careful what you see.

Make every choice carefully or you’ll become the despair I’ve seen.

Such words sound poetic or wise.

They mean nothing when not applied.

Ignoring guidance may leave you terrified.

Life isn’t a fairytale. Life is rough, mean and callous, but we never read of such truth in our days of innocence. When our hearts were full of love for plush toys and we could cry over sweet animated films so quickly with abandon! “I’ll pray for you” can often be overused. Almost like “Have a good one” or “Take care now” or “We’ll see you.” It’s supposed to mean something, and for many, it still does.

Odds are you have a prayer warrior somewhere praying for you today. Even if you never knew them. As hard as it can be to believe at times of incarceration it may even be a staff member or other state employee. You never know when God’s going to put something on someone’s heart. Prayer for me has never stopped. I go to church. I’ve been baptized for so long, about twenty years now. As I write this I’m thirty-two! That doesn’t mean my troubles stop. I’m in prison with a substantial amount of time. I was sent here with a 120.5 year sentence. Some ask, “Do you have all day?” Meaning what amounts to life, yeah, I guess that counts as all day, maybe some of the night too. That doesn’t mean I have to sink to some of the standards of other men in prison. God’s delivered me from that. That alone, even if it meant there was still no hope of salvation, is still being rescued in my book.

I see others. And I see how I could’ve been. More than that I’m a survivor. So many are shocked to see how I survived long enough to even be arrested. God must’ve sent an angel down so many times in my life. Whether you’re rescued by the hand of God or the police, you’re still going to repeatedly ask why. There has to be purpose or meaning to it all.

I think of Jeremiah 29:11: ‘“For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”’ Attorneys have abandoned me and taken advantage of me. Some people have tattoos. I have scars. Some are seen, some are unseen. But they all matter to those who love me, and to God. Especially to God.

One day late on a feeling though, and the courts will dismiss your brief with prejudice. I should’ve freaked out when every little thing went wrong or seemed to. But the spirit of God spoke to me. Telling me I’d pull it off whenever there was a problem or delay. God helped me meet my deadlines so many times and make the impossible or improbable possible. No, the responses weren’t always what I was looking for. They usually were the opposite. But God saw me through it all. I was rescued from my own death. From the hands of many men. I’m still here. God is still in prison. He didn’t leave when Jesus was crucified.

What I and others experience is often injustice. But we will live a victorious life over our circumstances. We’re being guided and we’re listening for his voice. I’m preparing myself for what’s next at every turn. And I hope others will seize their purpose and its inheritance. We were rescued, we were meant for such great things. I hope and pray anyone who reads this recognizes their rescue! And that they’re willing to take possession of their destiny.
