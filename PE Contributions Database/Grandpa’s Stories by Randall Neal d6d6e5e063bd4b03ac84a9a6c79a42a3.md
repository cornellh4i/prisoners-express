**Grandpa’s Stories by Randall Neal**

As Grandpa Henry was driving his grandchildren to the new house in the country that he and Grandma Gretta had just purchased, he decided that he should tell them the story before the children ever entered the house for the first time. Henry suddenly stopped his pick-up on the side of the one-lane dirt road. He pointed his crooked finger to his right. The two grandchildren turned their heads to the right.

“That’s it?” eight year old Darren asked.

“It looks haunted,” ten year old Cheryl remarked.

Grandpa Henry grinned and began his story. “It is haunted and has been since 1854 when the family of four disappeared without a trace. Well… not much of a trace, anyway. The ten year old girl who happened to be named Cheryl was the only family member they never found any trace of. They say she lives within those walls but never comes out until she’s hungry.”

“How do they know when she’s hungry Grandpa?” Darren asked.

“They know because they hear her howling late at night.” Grandpa slid a sideways glance to see if the children were listening, and they were, so he continued.

“Some people say it’s nothing more than tall-tales, but nobody had been brave enough to move into the place since then. Now Grandma and me, we ain’t believing in these stories, so we moved in and we are still here.”

“Have you heard the girl howling?” Cheryl grinned as she rolled her blue eyes.

“Yes. But only once so far. But the story goes that the girl will transform into a beast after she howls but she is afraid to enter into the master bedroom. Nobody knows why, she just won’t enter so that tells me that Grandma and me is safe as long as we sleep in the master bedroom. The girl only turns into a beast late at night. Usually around ten o’clock, or shortly after.

“It all started one evening when Cheryl was real hungry and her dad had made her go to bed without her supper cause she had snuck into the kitchen before supper and stole a piece of her mother’s pie that was for the church. Well… after her parents were fast asleep, Cheryl snuck into the kitchen again but was afraid to turn on the light. So she grabbed a small bad that was sitting beside the refrigerator and slinked back through the shadows of the hallway back to her room. Still afraid to turn on a light, she reached into the bad and retrieved a few morsels of food and ate them quickly. They tasted so nasty that she turned on her light anyway to see what she had eaten. It was fried dog food.”

“Dog food!” Cheryl interrupted. “How gross Grandpa!”

“Did she get sick and puke all over her bedroom?” Darren laughed.

“No she didn’t get sick and puke, but she suddenly felt like something was changing.” Grandpa paused for effect.

“What was it?” Cheryl inquired.

“The girl noticed that her short finger nails were growing into long black claws. She felt her face growing as well so she turned on her light and looked in her mirror. To her horror, her nose and mouth had sprung out and looked like the snout of a coyote. She opened her snout and saw that her teeth had turned yellow and had grown into long fangs. Her stomach growled with hunger. Darren had awakened and heard the low growling coming from his sister’s room. Then he heard her door squeak open and the long claws scraping down the wooden floor of the dark hallway.” Grandpa paused again. Cheryl and Darren’s eyes were glued to the house in the open field. Grandpa continued.

“Darren was so afraid he snuck out his bedroom window and slunk down the side of the haunted house in a low crouch. When he was under the kitchen window, he thought he heard his mother’s voice telling Cheryl to go back to bed. Then he heard the growling and ripping sounds coming out of the kitchen window. Too afraid to stand up and look, he let his eyes roam up the rocky wall and settle on the wooden windowsill. That’s when he saw the golden-blonde hair shaking wildly to the left and to the right. His eyes jumped back down into their sockets as he imagined his mother’s body being ripped up to smithereens. Blood and guts flying all over the kitchen walls and ceiling. Then an awful, scary silence fell across the shadows of night.

“Then the silence was broken as Darren heard the long black claws scraping towards the living room where he knew his dad was probably fast asleep in his recliner with the newspaper spread out over his chest. Darren slunk down to the living room window and remained still and quiet. The low growl of the half-girl, half-beast was slowly ripping something apart. Darren imagined more blood and guts flying all over the living room. He raced to the wooden steps of the spiral staircase that lead to the top of the bell-tower. Darren clambered up the steps and reached the bell-tower, which was pitch back except for one sliver of moonlight streaking toward the inky black corner where he decided to hide from the beast.

In the eerie silence of the murky shadows, Darren heard the soft scraping of the long black claws crawling slowly upwards. He closed his eyes in belief that if he couldn’t see the beast, the beast couldn’t see him. But then he trembled with agonizing fear as the beast growled in what sounded like perfect english. ‘Get up!’ The beast growled again. Darren slowly opened his eyes as the beast growled once more. ‘Get up! Mom says you’re going to be late for school your first day!’ That’s when Darren realized that it was his own sister that was the beast.” Grandpa stopped and stared at his grandchildren.

“Oh grandpa! You made all that up trying to scare me,” Cheryl laughed.

“We don’t scare that easy grandpa,” Darren giggled.

“Well, your dad’s the one that said you turn into a beast when you don’t get enough to eat,” Grandpa and Darren laughed.

Later that night, Cheryl lay in her own bedroom watching the shadows dance across the walls while Darren lay wide awake in his own room listening for any growling sounds in the murky shadows. At 10:15 pm, the lone coyote howled at the moon and Grandpa smiled while Grandma Gretta read her book. To her amazement, two grandchildren barreled through the master bedroom door, leaped through the air and landed between her and Henry. The two children slinked under the covers and snuggled up against both Grandpa and Grandma’s sides.

“What in the world is the matter with you two?” Grandma asked.

“Grandpa told us the story of this house,” Cheryl silently grinned.

“How this house became haunted!” Darren grinned silently back towards Cheryl.

“Henry! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, scaring your own grandchildren.”

“What?” Henry yelped with a wry smile. “It was just a story!”

Cheryl and Darren snickered under the covers. Grandpa was in trouble again for telling his stories. What neither one had ever confessed to Grandma Gretta was the fact that they merely used Grandpa’s stories as an excuse to sleep with them when they came to visit.

Ah, the precious memories of Grandpa’s stories!
