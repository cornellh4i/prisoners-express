**"Island" by Norris Beebe**

A roaring SKRASHHHH filters a quiet morning's cool breeze. For a moment, a flash of a lightning bolt showed through segments of painted dark grays across the raging skies. Another flash strikes followed by its crash streaks in the distance, though it sounded closer than before.

It’s headed in our direction. As the wind began to show its strength, we hurried inside.

Moving forward, the baby blue skies turned ugly pushing with a force no one had ever experienced. Her clouds were ominous, and thunder and lightning voiced a path of brilliance.

Drip, drip, drop, came the sound of splattering rain with a smell that had not crossed our paths for years. A drought of famine had finally come to an end. Her anger tore a hole into the lakes of Heaven pouring showers on the earth without end. The waters came down with violence overflowing riverbanks with a rush. SKRASHHH… came again with a flash and the doors were sealed.

Without a care, their shouts of lusts and laughers filtered out the drum beat of the falling spatter. No matter the signs, they played on. *What is this?* they all wondered. It's a drizzle of rain, was heard murmured by the crowd as they stirred and played in the rain.

Pouncing the puddles, they danced with stride, smiles and laughter came from them all. Twisting and turning, dripping wet, enjoying the showers as they poured down. And the sound of the rushing rage creeped upon them though they continued a rage of lusts and laughers of their own…

Another flash and a crash, then a panic in their minds filtered their pasts. Stunned by the storm's wrath, leveled by the rivers flow, a flood began to rise and their panic began to show with screams of horror.

"Help us," someone called out. "He's just a baby," another yelled, "forgive us", one cried, but it was too late. There was nothing anyone could do and by the time they comprehended the consequences of their actions, the wood made craft was tossed by a rage of the tides. The wind's pounding force pushed and carried the boat, tossing her throughout a frightful night. From cap to cap, we drifted off into the unknown. As the Earth's breath shifted a cool breeze upon us, our sway from port to starboard was at peace. The sky was at a dim gray and the sun had not shown itself for days. A scent of freshness fills our day with delight as we work with pride. Still, with enchantment, we worked and life goes on regardless of what each day may bring.

With a sudden jostle, the grasp of a shallow shore bottom creeps us to a halt. The shoreline peeks its face through the receding waters below. The sun shares a ray of light through one of the windows as we all look on with utter excitement. With a smile, all of the windows are opened taking into a shining new day of summer. Though water is all that is seen, a tear of joy fills our eyes and for all of the lost, that could not be saved.

Tap. Tap. Crash. A good morning awakened with the crash of our doors being unsealed. A rush of fresh air came in with a mighty push. As we looked upon the door with amazement, at last, the Earth's surface is dry. The waters have receded and the view outside is so beautiful.

Then God said to Noah, "leave the boat. All of you- you and your wife and sons and their wives. Release all of the animals so they can be fruitful and multiply throughout the Earth."

So, Noah and his family released all of the animals, large and small. All of the birds came out of the boat pair by pair. Oh what beauty has the Lord our God brought forth on this day. And so, we shall give thanks and offerings to our God.

Noah and his sons set off in search of a perfect courtyard to build an altar for the Lord. The world seemed so clear, so clean, so fresh, and so peaceful. One could only imagine what the top of Mt. Ararat would have been in the brightness of this day.

The flock of the air caught their attention when Japheth spotted the dove his father sent out in search of dry land. It was perched on an olive branch of fresh bloom. Surrounded by water that receded with the tide. Hidden by the sea by day. Rising up by night. This would preserve its beauty so they all gathered what was needed to build a temple for the Lord our God.

Within a few days, a newly built structure of God formed around the old olive tree where the birds of the air made their home. There, Noah and his family who would repopulate the Earth sacrificed and unblemished animals appropriate for this purpose. The lord was pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice and said unto thee," I will never again curse the ground of the human race." and the covenant of our God to Noah and the Earth was made at the top of Mt. Ararat this day using a rainbow as the sign of their covenant forever.

Noah and his family were fruitful and fill the earth with many. They cultivated the land and were bleeding. With each Sabbath, an offering was given to the Lord at the Altar that Noah and his sons built after the flood. As it stands today, hidden by the day, raised up by the night, the Altar of the Lord remains.
