**Life's Purpose by Raymond Springs II**

Lifeâ€™s Purpose equals knowledge of Self as one's self knowledge meaning how one has evolved over history, (species, culture, physically, mentally, communally, societally and as an individual) how and who one is presently, (from birth in the physical reality up to this moment in time which is best called or identified as now) and who and what one will be or become in the future. Life's Purpose is to Self Actualize as be oneself, this may seem simple enough to the unconscious minded folks who accept the roles assigned by society as their truest identity like one believing their life's purpose into help others and practices medicine, dentistry, law enforcement, firefighting, surgery, psychology, etc. these are rolls and position and not living entities. Life's Purpose is in recognition that the universe is one thing and the suns, moons, stars, planets, our earth with everything on it is only a part of the whole as the highest form of intelligence which means Supreme Mind and having a physical vessel meaning body of being our life which means force, power and creative energy and Purpose means function, destiny, intention, resolution, aim, ambition, design meaning is actualizing Supreme Being which is to be God.
