“B.B. “ That’s what she called me. Her “brown baby,” the first born, the favorite grandchild. Her explanations for difficult topics were always age appropriate. “Grandma, why is your skin so white and mine brown?” my four year old self asked.

She replied, “B.B., when my mama was pregnant with me, she drank bleach.” At ten, she explained the brutal truths of why and how she was conceived, the product of rape, and of the many challenges of being biracial in Tennessee in the 30’s and her migration to Detroit in the 50’s. Grandma’s health declined, and we insisted she live with us. I considered it a privilege and honor to care for her. My husband spoiled her rotten.

She began to have minor memory lapses. Once, while we were walking toward the exit of a suburban boutique, she stopped and stared at me with blank eyes. “Who the hell are you?” Everyone stared. To strangers, I’m a black woman in an all white neighborhood, telling an elderly, mink-coat clad white woman to leave with me. She yells, “That is *not* my granddaughter! My granddaughter is not fat!”

The police arrived and searched her purse (they discovered 3 pairs of earrings Granny nabbed) and called the emergency contact listed: my parents and me. My parents arrived, and she immediately recognized my mother. She looked at me and smiled, “Oh, good She’s back,” I thought. On the way out, she leans over and whispers conspiratorially to my mother, “Call B.B. so she can whip this fat girl’s ass. Damn impostor.” After that incident, she was prescribed medication to slow the progression of dementia, though many lucid moments followed.

She obsessively asked about her missing twin brother, Dan. She hadn’t seen him since the 50’s. My Uncle Steve found Dan in the ‘80s, and Dan wanted to be “left alone.” Rather than hurt his mother, he told her he couldn’t find him. If Dan doesn’t want to be in the family, fine, but he can’t speak for other family members.

It’s 2003, and thank God for the internet! I discovered he was a widower and made contact with his ecstatic daughter, Alice. We made plans to meet, and 15 of my relatives including grandma flew to Alabama for the sibling reunion. During the flight, my mother whispers, “B.B., did you tell them we’re black?”

“No, they know that. Doesn’t matter,” I replied. My mother paled and notified the others. Imaginations ran wild, and in each horrible scenario, it’s my fault.

As we were getting settled in at the hotel, Alice called and said they had all been waiting downstairs for two hours. Initially, we planned to meet at a restaurant, but Alice said they were too excited. How did we walk right past them? Oh. My. God. They think we’re white. I was guilted into escorting grandma down, while the cowards waited for a report. We exited the elevator and standing in the lobby is an older, bald white man. On a closer inspection, he resembles grandma, albeit his complexion is olive toned but the green eyes are the same. A gang of at least 20 white people wearing Confederate flag hats appeared beside him. Oh Lord, what have I gotten myself into? They probably left their robes in the car. The elderly wins quickly shuffled toward each other and embraced while murmuring, “Thank God,” over and over again.

All eyes fell on me. Some said, “Thank you so much. That will be all. We can take her until the family comes down.”

I smiled, took a deep breath, and said, “I’m B.B. Before you ask, I’m not biracial: I’m black. I’m not adopted. My grandmother and your father are biracial. Is this going to be okay with you?”

Silence. Hotel clerks and guests are all staring. It’s a strange scene with me in stilettos and black business pants suit and the women in cut-off shorts and wife beaters. I couldn’t move. I thought, “At least she got a chance to see him. This was a bad idea. They hate me.” It took everything to remain there. This was when I took a leap of faith. In my Yankee accent, I reached out to my country kin and say, “Y’all, we family.”

A lady stepped forward with an extended hand. “I’m Julia, the baby girl, and if it’s not okay, don’t worry. We gonna make it okay. We family, girl.”

I didn’t realize I’d been holding my breath, and I burst into tears. I couldn’t stop looking at Julia. She looks identical to my mother. If she got a dark tan and was taller, they could pass for twins. After reporting to the cowards, half of Dan’s family left before they arrived.

“Liar!” my relatives yelled. To Dan’s credit, he offered no excuses. When asked why not just tell the truth, he replied, “Who would choose to live a hard life? You live a lie so long, it becomes the truth.”

Just as he was present when my grandma entered the world, he was there when she exited. The fat granddaughter reunited them!
