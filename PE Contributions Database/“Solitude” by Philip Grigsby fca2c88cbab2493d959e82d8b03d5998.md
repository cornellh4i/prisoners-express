**“Solitude” by Philip Grigsby**

Here I sit, along again, the serenity before my eyes a stranger to my heart. So much evil I endured as an innocent, so much evil I committed on innocents, my soul is scared, theirs as well.

Why can’t the beauty before me penetrate the darkness within me? I long for peace, but it shuns me. I fear if I touch the calm silence of the water, the raging turmoil that is my aura will pollute it, why must horror be my wake?

The night will soon blind me from this sight, will the memory remain? Or will it die like the others? In the darkness I will battle the demons, they will tear my skin, I will disobey them.

In solitude, only I am hurt, others are safe, so here I will stay, am I the monster they call me? Would they understand if I shouted to the distant mountains “I can’t love, they won’t love me”?

Would my sacrifice be appreciated? Or would they still look at me with disgust?

In solitude I find peace, my solitude gives others peace, the world will not miss me, I though will miss the love I was denied.
