**“Where the Wind Blew” by Cambren Thomas**

****Note to the reader: When wishing for something, think hard and watch your wording. You may get exactly what you ask for. I know I did, and here’s my story…

It was the middle of the night, and I awoke again in my prison cell. I don’t remember exactly what random nightmare had awoken me, but I arose with restless disdain, knowing that I was going to be up for a while. I sluggishly got up from my bunk, yawning, and I shuffled my way to my cell window. As I looked out across the oppressive fences, surrounding buildings, and patrolling COs, my eyes were drawn up by the cloudless and star-filled sky above.

To take in the cool breeze, I slowly hand-cranked the old-fashioned lever that opened my window. As I continued to search the sky for familiar sights like the Big Dipper, the Zodiac Signs, and the North Star, I caught a clear view of the fiery, yellow-orange-green streaks of a shooting star. As I watched the natural wonder plummet toward the earth, I was reminded of the beauty of freedom, the feeling of seeing such a sight 10 years ago--from my apartment balcony with my girl and a Budweiser in hand.

At that very moment, I uttered through a sigh, “I wish I could just *blow* this joint and be free.” The shooting star that had arrested my gaze fizzled out into a spark-filled explosion: it was like a firework sent straight from God himself. My attention was then brought back to the bland environment of my prison cell. I turned, sadly, and headed back to my bunk. It was then that an unusual breeze came in through my window, stopping me in my tracks. It slowly poured in through the window screen, like any other wind, but then within seconds, it became a raging gust of hurricane force intensity. My pictures, papers, and commissary were all tossed around like in a category F5 tornado.

I stood in the middle of the fray, frozen. The strange wind wrapped around me with an unnaturally constricting grasp; as it squeezed tighter, I was disintegrated within it. I was bonded with the wind and whisked away. I was brought out through the window screen of my cell and into the open air, leaving my state clothes and property behind in disarray.

I slowly wafted along the grass of the rec yard then blew over to the concrete of the courts, rolling a basketball along as I moved upward to a guard tower. I jetted across the back of a patrolling guard, startling him and blowing the hat off of his head. I took his hat for a ride with me as I continued to soar above and beyond the razor wire of the fencing, up toward the stars of the night sky.

Freedom and I were now synonymous. My thoughts were captivated by where I might be travelling to next, and the possibilities were now infinite… To be continued…
