**“At Peace” by Brother Boston**

Yelling, screaming, arguing, fighting…day after day for five and a half years the same foolishness, when did jail get like this Lord?

I remember thirty-five years ago when I was a teenager going to county jail, it was a seventy to thirty ratio of old heads to us youngsters, but today it’s reversed ninety to ten. These young boys who claim they are men and gangsters overpopulate the jails...and I believe it's not only here in Florida; I believe it’s all over this “Great” country of Trumps’.

These young, immature, video game zombies run around here yelling, screaming, arguing, and fighting like their bastard children in first and second grades. I hate to use that derogatory word when speaking of children, but all of us born out of wedlock, face it, are called bastards.

I had no idea how low the generations had sunk until I came to this state. I guess in the outside world I was paying attention to the kids, but God put me in here to observe, learn, help these lost youngsters...I had to see firsthand how we (men) have let down this generation…

But let me get back to the issue at hand for a moment...yelling, screaming, arguing, fighting...for five and a half years this has been a part of me every waking hour.

Some of the people where I come from in Boston, Massachusetts would have had a mental meltdown by now; why not me? Well, I can only attribute it to my walk in Christ and my willingness to do His Will and help those lost souls. One day a few weeks ago I said, “Lord, I’m so tired of all this noise, dealing with two roommates who fight all the time, everyone who walks through my cell door having problems they need me to solve.” I said, “Lord I need a little peace and quiet.” Three days later I was put into solitary confinement for a misunderstanding...at first I was really upset because in five and a half years I’ve never run afoul of the authorities, not so much as a warning...but after day two of lying peacefully in my one man room, listening to the quiet, I knew God had answered my prayer (Thank You Jesus)...

In the three weeks I’ve been in here, I’ve gotten into working out again, lost about ten pounds, shaved off my fro-hawk, gotten deeper into my Bible studies...all and all I’ve been able to strengthen myself, physically, mentally, and most importantly spiritually. I’ve been blessed to come across a book called “The Resolution for Men” by Steven and Alex Kendrick, with RAndy Alcorn. Every Man must read this book. It tells men to step up, be the men God created us to be, raise our children so they don’t grow up Yelling, Screaming, Arguing, and Fighting like first and second graders. Though this may not be me sitting alone on a dock, in peace, talking to God and enjoying the beauty He created, it is me, sitting alone, talking to God, **At Peace**, seeing the beauty He is creating in me.

God Bless You All!
