**“Unappreciated” (Or “Special Dinner”) by Brent Seth Elskän**

“Okay, honey; open your eyes!”

“AH! What the HELL, Gary!?!”

“...Uh, I thought you said you like foie gras.” Gary’s face displayed confusion and disappointment.

“THAT ISN’T FOIE GRAS, YOU MORON!” Kelly’s face was pale, eyes wide in horror, brows angry. “What’s...are they...is that actually…”

“Yes, foie gras -- ‘feet of the baby’!” He tried offering them to her again, presenting them with a hopeful smile.

“Foie gras does NOT mean that! Where the *hell* did you come up with *that* crap?!” Kelly was turning green.

“Well, the online guys….”

“DON’T TRUST PEOPLE ONLINE, GARY!!”

“Jeez, you don’t have to screech, Kel. Just calm down, would you? I’ll...I’ll just…” He looked around the kitchen like he might find an answer about what to do.

“*Just* what? You idiot?” Kelly convulsed as if she may vomit.

“Well, dammit, Kelly, I thought you’d appreciate the effort at least. Sheesh.” He started putting the little Ziploc back around one of the toes. “You can be *so* ungrateful sometimes, you know that?.... *So* ungrateful.”

At least he still had the paté.
