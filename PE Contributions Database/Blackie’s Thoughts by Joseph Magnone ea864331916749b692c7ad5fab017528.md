***Blackie’s Thoughts* by Joseph Magnone**

Hi there,

So you took my picture and now let me introduce myself to you. My name is Blackie. You think you are looking at a stray but I assure you that you are not, I am absolutely free to roam around and do as I please whenever it pleases me. I have no bounds. I will never bow down to a human master, there will never be a collar or lease on me. No one will ever make me do tricks for them and they take the credit for them. No one will ever parade me around and show me off like an object to their friends in order to build themselves up. I will never be anyone’s prisoner or pet.

However, when I look at you, I see a prisoner, a pet in human form with a collar and leash by which I mean a job and responsibilities, doing handiwork (tricks) while your boss (master) takes the credit and tells you good boy or girl and you don’t even get a treat.

I am the picture of freedom. Envy me. You are a prisoner and I feel sorry for you. If I could take your true picture you would see what I see. Well, gotta go rustle up some grub. Maybe I will see you later. Sorry if the truth hurt.

Your vision of freedom,

Blackie
