**The Truth by Randell Cornelius**

After 20+ years in prison for a crime I know God knows and my family knows I didn’t commit I find myself smiling at times heartbroken, angry hopeful hopeless fearful and fearless. As you see, I go through the motions. I’m fearless because they can have my body but not my soul. Fearful because my nieces are growing up with no one to protect them. Hopeless in a justice system that will serve no justice but hopeful that I can continue to defy the laws of breaking down by finding more ways of breaking through. Angry because I couldn’t see my Mother before she passed and that I didn’t call her not knowing something unexpected was about to happen. Heartbroken at the way people treat one another, how selfish and heartless people can be to others suffering just like them but because they look different they cannot bring their feelings to see them as human just like you and me. Maybe you do not understand because you are not me. I once found myself getting stuck in that same personality until I become my own person. Started thinking my own freewill just as God intended and I love freely as God loves me with no attachments and that all he wants from us is to love others as he loves us. So I believe by seeing just a little bit of yourself in everyone you come into contact with for better understanding and a little more love. So smile when you get up. Smile when you lay down no matter what happens. Today, find something to smile about tomorrow because our happiness is a delusion until we make it the truth!
