Hey, I was thinking how you mentioned dreams and still I haven’t had a dream as long as I remember... Now, after thinking I do remember a dream I had a long time ago. Back when I first started this time.

Ok, I believe my son was barely born. I was locked up when he was born. I think my girlfriend was about six month when I got caught for my crime. So I was in the county jail when my son Jason. (I named him after a close friend who was killed) Well I never got to hold him or touch him. I really never understood the effect that had on me until this dream I had while I was going to court.

The dream was like this. I woke up to a call on the speaker, calling me to court, to go to the day room. Well I got up, got ready, looked out my cell window and saw a crazy landscape. I stepped out of my cell door and saw a crazy landscape. I stepped out of my cell door, and stepped into the courtroom. But instead of being in the gallery where we’re normally held until our court time is on. I was seated in the back wall standing watching over one. I saw my girl and she had my son in her arms over her shoulder, left shoulder. Everyone one was looking forward. He was the only one (my son) looking back at me. I was stunned really. I could see his face. He looked at me, outreached his arms and said daddy! I cried in my dream. As I was crying I woke up to tears coming down. I’ve never experienced anything like it before or since.

It’s funny how you added this to help start a journal. I did use your tip: because I really didn’t know where to start, but after thinking about dreams. It’s been years since I’ve had any. I know I had some, I just don’t remember or try too. On the flip side, that goes the same as with nightmares. (When I’m reminded about nightmares, I’m reminded of a book about a black horse that delivers bad dreams. Get it nightmare! I believe Piers Anthony I think.) Yeah well nightmares are my dreams. I haven’t had one in years.

I do hope, I never give up hope. Hope is what keeps me alive. I don’t pray. I feel like a hypocrite. I know my mom’s family prayed. I feel their prayers, as well as have seen their prayers keep me safe! If I were to write every time something sad could have happened to me. Lets just say their prayers keep me safe everyday. Hope is all I have. I don’t have to bend my knees to hope! And not feel guilty that I live this life how I live, and just hope. I will do better.

As for wish. I wish I could get my typewriter back. My hand hurts. Haha or lol!

You know I’ve been locked up long before cell phones. So I've been doing emojis long before that. :( :) All that! And lol was haha.

Until no dreams, or haven't had any in a long time. Or can’t remember them when I get up... But as soon as I get one I'll keep you posted.

Oh yeah and when I mentioned this project to my mom she was happy. Really happy. Not just some mechanical smile, that I recognize for so long. She had a genuine look of happiness. I guess that is why I really want to work at this. I love that look on her face. This son say; it all, that ol me is dead and gone, I’ve been away for way too long. I guess it takes some of us a long time to see the light due seen on this road for a way too long of time. Funny that's all I know is time. I’ve done so much of it all I do is day for day; but lately I've been looking at the future, seeing myself free! Not just hoping for freedom but seeing my freedom just a few days away. Day and month are not the same to me as to most. I do day to day weather a week passes or months there all the same. Only now I’m getting the understanding of time. Not just day in day out. There’s more to it, it’s the future that’s getting close I believe. You mention how our words can reach beyond these walls. :) Believe me I understand that I’ve had pen pals throughout the years and that is how it feels. As if our words are beyond these walls. It helps my thinking as well. I can let my aggression off on paper, and not on any one around me. Its taken a long time to keep that kind of emotion in check. And not just let it build inside off and don’t write while you’re mad. Well you can just don’t send it out on the first draft. Set it to the side and then go through your emotions after the final draft! Haha lol. I learned this the hard way you can hurt worse with these words then with a knife! Cut deeper with a pen than with any sword. Crazy I mean I heard this before reading it in a song or poem but until you do it you still you really don’t know.

This helps capture our important thoughts. I now keep a composition book by my bed so if I have a thought or word that sounds good together like a sun in the air. You tune in to the wave of words. Just write it down. You know I got that from Nixx Sixx. I listen to his syndicated radio station. I like metal/rock/classic rock. So he said to us to walk around with his notebook. And I started to keep my book by my side. And it helped. I caught things I would normally forget since I got a bad memory. Really just the short term is bad. I tell everyone I can't lie cause I forget my lies so it's best not to...
