**“The Things We Do” by Leo Cardez**

My feet were freezing, heart pounding out of my chest -- everything inside of me was telling me to get the hell out of there.

I was waist deep in the pristine, crystal clear, ice cold mountain river. The initial adrenaline dump into my nervous system was wearing off. I knew heat escapes two to four times faster in water than in air -- I only had another minute before I would start to lose motor function. My lungs demanded a huge gulp of air; I took a deep breath and went under.

Where is it!? Where the fuck is it!? Fuck that ring, shit isn’t worth my life, I think, but I keep desperately scrounging the river bottom. I won’t notice the deep cuts and scrapes I sustained until hours later. My body was at DEFCON 1, desperate to survive, redistributing blood from my extremities toward my essential organs.

There it is, thank Christ almighty! My feet are so numb I can’t feel them as I stumble out of the frigid waters and plop onto the river bank like a beached whale. My feet clattered like maracas as I shivered uncontrollably.

“Did you find the ring, babe?” she asked as she covered me with a blanket. I held out my trembling hand, unable to speak, but it was clenched tightly into a death grip.

It must have slipped off while I was trying to rinse the dishes, I’m so stupid, she muttered between sobs. No make-up, eyes swollen from crying and still she was utterly beautiful in the morning sun. I willed my fingers to loosen revealing the sparkling diamond.

“Oh babe, thank you, I love you so much!” she shrieked while holding me tightly. I just smiled and thought to myself: totally worth it.
