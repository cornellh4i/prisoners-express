**“Believe It or Not” by Anthony Scott**

Throughout my journey of incarceration, I’ve had the liberty of experiencing growth and observing progression in many others. Growing to understand that good or healthy thoughts reside in us all has helped to shape my new level of elevation. So believe it or not, everyone that’s suffering from physical, mental, or spiritual imprisonment will eventually display in and outward growth in some aspect of existence as time proceeds. My challenge to you all is to see the positive and acknowledge the smallest amount of change in every person.

Believe it or not, this will change the way you see people forver.
