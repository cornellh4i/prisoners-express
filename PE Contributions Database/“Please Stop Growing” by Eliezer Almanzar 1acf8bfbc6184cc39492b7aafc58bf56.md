**“Please Stop Growing” by Eliezer Almanzar**

When I left, she was 6 and he was 4 and every time I close my eyes to think about them they’re the same age. They’ve not grown an inch in my head. While being here feels like time has stopped and your life is on pause, it’s also hard to accept that life outside of these razor wired topped fences has kept on moving. Just as years have gone by here, they’ve gone by out there.

They’re growing, but I can’t tell. My memories are from four years ago. She’s already talking about an iPhone and he learned to play FortNite on PS4 and joined a baseball team. When did all this happen? Would you please stop growing?

It seems like a long time ago when the only place she could fall asleep was my chest, when he wanted to play with Lego’s and PlayDoh, when I had two little monkeys jumping on the bed, and at the same time, now it feels like time’s not running at all.

If my life is on pause I wish I could pause theirs as well, it may sound selfish, but I want to get out and pick up from exactly where I said goodbye, explaining I was going to school then work and that I didn’t know how long I was going to be gone. All I did was promised, in tears, that one day, I would come back for them.

On my wall above a picture where they’re hugging I have a sign that reads, “This is Why” for a shortened version of: “This is why I have to get out, stay problem-free, stay positive, get up in the mornings, pray at night, and stay involved in their lives”.

Growing up is inevitable. Still, I wish I could find them small, beautiful, and innocent - just as I left them.

I also have to be grateful because both have amazing mothers. We don’t always agree, but it’s my job to be supportive and understanding because any decision they make affects the kids. I can’t be judgemental or get into arguments, and risk my only line of communication. If they kill that line, it’ll eventually kill me.

Sometimes, I do the baby talk and Daddy’s Little Princess loves it, but he doesn’t. He’s a “Big Boy,” he says, he wants Nerf guns, roller coasters, and made me promise we’ll jump off a plane in parachutes. I made that promise. On her 6th birthday, I asked her to stay 6 forever, she said, “I don’t know how” and I had a cuteness attack. According to her, I’m not allowed to date, and neither is she until she’s 18, that’s the deal, hopefully it lasts. She’s the jealous type, I’m hers and she’s mine, end of story, and I agree. At the same time, Big Boy gives all the girls Valentines cards, most of the classroom girls are his girlfriends, and all I can do is give him tips on being a gentleman.

Another year goes by. She’ll be 10 on October 26 and he’ll be 8 on November 26. They would’ve been born the same month, but Princess couldn’t wait to meet me, I guess, and Big Boy was the best deal I got after a Black Friday. Experiencing their birth was the weirdest and most wonderful happening ever. There’s no greater love, only the love of God for us, and He wants us to grow and learn. I’d love to tell them to stop growing, but I also want them to grow and learn, and right now, I couldn’t be more proud.

Should I try for parole which adds three more years, or max out when she’ll be 19 and he’ll be 17? I know the answer. In the meantime, I can close my eyes and see them just as I left them: small, beautiful, and innocent.

Love is patient and forgiving, and the only thing we feel that transcends the dimensions of time and space. Time is always short for those who need it, but for those who love, it lasts forever. I’ll love you Emely and Emmanuel until the end of time, and hope you love me and forgive me for missing all these years.

I invite you all to find ways to stay involved, it may be hard but love finds a way. One way I’ve stayed involved with my daughter is by having flowers delivered to her school on her birthday, she absolutely loves it. With my son, I send a gift for his birthday, books that he reads to me, and we keep each other updated on the hottest Reggaeton songs.

Blessings to all the fathers, stay involved, and remember - they will not stop growing.
