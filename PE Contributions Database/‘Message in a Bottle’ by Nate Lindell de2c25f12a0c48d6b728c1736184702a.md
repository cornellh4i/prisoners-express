**‘Message in a Bottle’** **by Nate Lindell**

After spending 15-plus years in solitary confinement, it’s weird yet essential (for my sanity and health) that I go to outside rec and exercise my body.

The first time I lapped the track I felt like I couldn’t fully inhale or exhale. I feared I might have a heart attack. It was a feeling deeper, more fatal than any I’ve previously felt, when I was younger and pushed my body aerobically, I’m 44, haven’t been able to run a ¼ mile lap in five years, forced to jog in circles in a 12x16 rec cage four times a week, which seems to have taken a toll on my body.

Scientific research has advanced to the point that it can be articulated how our bodies produce our “spirits”, or as is stated in the title of a July 2019 article in Scientific American, “how matter becomes mind”. So if my body has been atrophied by years in solitary confinement, and my body (centralized in my brain) produces my mind, then my mind, my personhood is atrophied too.

An alternative, non-scientific theory of mind is that my mind is a non-physical unitary spirit (not the manifestation of multitudes of psychological processes produced by multitudes of specific brain regions, which actively interact with each other in a unified manner in healthy people). If this theory is true, then was my spirit poisoned by years spent in solitude, surrounded by the screams and threats of deranged inmates and sadistic staff?

Many prisoners around me have said I’m “crazy”. Some look at me out of the corner of their eyes, as if they fear I’ll do something to ‘em. Other prisoners, including many obviously seriously mentally ill guys (self-mutilators), who’ve also spent long periods in seg, feel comfortable around me (I help them with litigation). This makes me fear that I must appear “crazy,” volatile, “dangerous.” I fear this because it means that both decent prisoners and staff will avoid me while dirty staff and inmates will connive to get me off their radar and back in seg (this happened recently when a razor was planted on me; fortunately I mustered enough evidence to get back out)

My body hurts from anxiety over this Catch-22-seg made me “crazy” and that craziness threatens to isolate me and put me back in seg.

Poison-tipped needles poke deep into my tissues, burning me.

The psychologist is scared of me, not surprisingly. A psychologist at a prior prison poison-penned me, noted in bold capital letters something like, “THIS INMATE WILL ASSAULT STAFF, HAS DONE SO MULTIPLE TIMES.” Prior to that, a psychologist at WI’s super max arranged to have a hit shrink diagnose me as a psychopath and narcissistic, ironic diagnoses given the misery I endured in retaliation for writing complaints and lawsuits for mentally vulnerable prisoners who were being abused by staff. What would/could those prison psychologist say if they saw me talking a self-mutilator out of hurting himself, pushing the wheelchair for a crippled fellow Buddhist, teaching my cellie how to write so he can better understand himself and his emotions, calmly deescalating potentially deadly situations.

My body, my mind - those in power have tried to curse it by labelling it, while claiming to be “correcting” it.

My mind’s ability to reflect on all of this allows me to resist efforts to corrupt me, to understand past mistakes and warpings. At one time I’d’ve put a “but,” left room for excuses for failing to perfectly resist. “But” now I simply wish to be assured that someone understands what I’m saying, who I was, not the creature my captors wish to exist.
