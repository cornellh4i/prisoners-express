**Something Right by Yankee Lawyer**

Bobby was in terrible pain. He needed to tell his father that his mother had hurt him, but he didn’t know how. The doctors noticed that his cortisol levels were elevated, but they didn’t know why.

When Bobby was five months old, Pamela broke his arm again. This time, it swelled, and I knew something was very wrong. The local hospital wasn’t equipped to handle such severe trauma to a baby who had only been conceived a year before, so I took Junior to Duke University Medical Center.

Bobby was there for a week. The doctors x-rayed his entire body, put a cast on his arm, and contacted local police. Social workers and cops interrogated Pamela for many hours. The swelling in Bobby’s arm subsided and he was released.

I showed Bobby’s cast to the nurses and told them I needed to talk to a doctor. Bobby’s arm was no longer stabilized. The cast was flopping around on his arm, doing more harm than good. It needed to be changed. The nurses were rude and disrespectful. The doctor had told the authorities that Bobby had been physically abused by Pamela and his case was now a police matter.

The next week, I brought my son back to the hospital. A more competent doctor removed his cast, cut his arm open, put the bones in place, and sewed his arm up and stabilized it. When the swelling went down, he changed the cast and then discharged my son; but he did not help me to sue the other doctor or to apply for sole custody of my son.

A few years later, Pamela tore Bobby’s ear almost off. A doctor sewed it back on. I assembled a large pile of police reports, medical records, government reports, and other documents and took Bobby to the courthouse to show a judge his scars and apply for domestic violence protection.

Before we could get to a judge, Pamela found us. She snatched Bobby and went into hiding. I tracked her for three years, but she stayed a step ahead of me. She continued to spread vicious gossip about my son as well as about me. Bibby was, if she was to be believed, an escape artist, an acrobat, a liar, a thief, and one of the most devious seven year olds in the world. He tried to please Pamela and her Johns, but it seemed he could never do anything right.

Bobby was indeed becoming rebellious. He knew some of the things Pamela did with strange men. He told grownups that Pamela was mean, and a liar; but that only made things worse.

Doctors prescribed Ritalin. Psychologists subjected him to individual and group therapy. Bobby stopped talking about Pamela and she was finally able to teach him to do one thing. With the help of a growing cocktail of drugs, she trained him to tell increasingly bizarre stories of “recovered memories” of his father but the man he used to live with at home in Burlington.

Finally one day in July 2000, Pamela dressed Bobby up and took him back to Burlington. She made sure he was high enough to be compliant, but still sober enough to walk. She led him into the courthouse. A prosecutor helped him stagger to the witness stand and spin a sordid tale of rape, beatings, threats, sodomy and buggery.

Pamela got sole custody and a steady income from the government. I got a life sentence. For the first time in his life, Bobby got a hug from Pamela.

He had finally done something right.
