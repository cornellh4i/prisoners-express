**“Girlfriend Meme” by Cesar Hernandez**

Creating, holding, recalling thoughts, generating emotions, controlling emotions, and disciplining powerful inner drives all require a tremendous expenditure of energy. Where does all this energy come from? Why is the energy there sometimes, and at other times you feel completely drained? Have you ever noticed that when you are mentally and emotionally drained, food doesn’t help that much? Conversely, if you look at the times in your life when you were in love, or excited and inspired by something, you were so filled with energy that you didn’t even want to eat. This energy we are talking about does not come from the calories your body burns from food. There is a source of energy you can draw upon from inside. It is distinct from the outer energy source.

Let’s say your girlfriend breaks up with you. You get so totally depressed that you start staying home alone. You don’t have the energy to clean up so everything ends up sprawled all over the floow. You can hardly get out of bed, so you just sleep all the time. You must be eating, because there are pizza boxes lying all around. Nothing seems to help. You have no energy. Your friends invite you out, but you decline. You are simply too tired to do anything.

You feel that you have no way out, and it seems like you will stay there forever. Then suddenly, one day, the phone rings. It’s your girlfriend. The one who dumped you three months ago. She’s crying as she says, “Do you remember me? I hope you’ll still talk to me. I just feel so terrible. Leaving you was the worst mistake I ever made. I see now how important you are to me, and I can’t live without you. Can I come over and see you?”

Now how are you doing? How long does it take you to get enough energy to jump out of bed, clean up the apartment, take a shower, and get some color back into your face? It’s practically instantaneous. You’re filled with energy the moment you hang up the phone. How does this happen? You were completely drained. For months and months, you had no energy. Then out of nowhere, in a matter of seconds, there is so much energy, it blows you away.

You can’t just ignore these enormous shifts in your energy levels. Where exactly did all that energy come from? There was no sudden change in your eating or sleeping habits. Yet when your girlfriend comes by, you end up talking all night and going out to see the sunrise in the morning. You’re not tired at all. You’re together again and you’re holding hands and these rushes of joy just won’t stop overwhelming you. People see you and they remark that you look like a bundle of light. Where did all this energy come from?

If you watch carefully, you have a phenomenal amount of energy inside of you. It doesn’t come from food or sleep. This energy is always available to you. At any moment you can draw upon it. It just wells up and fills you from inside. When you’re filled with this energy, you feel like you could take on the world. When it is flowing strongly, you can actually feel it coursing through you in waves. It gushes up spontaneously from deep inside and restores, replenishes, and recharges you.

The only reason you don’t feel this energy all the time is because you block it. You block it by closing your heart, mind, and by pulling yourself into a restrictive space inside. This closes you off from all the energy. When you close your heart or close your mind, you hide in the darkness within you. There is no light. There is no energy. There is nothing flowing. The energy is still there but it can’t get in.

This is what it means to be “blocked”. That is why you have no energy when you’re depressed. There are centers within that channel your energy flow. When you close them, there is no energy. When you open them, there is. Although various energy centers exist within you, the one you intuitively know the most about opening and closing is your heart. Let’s say you love somebody, and you feel very open in their presence. Because you trust them, your walls come down, allowing you to feel lots of high energy. If they do something you don’t like, the next time you see them you don’t feel so high. You don’t feel as much love. Instead, you feel a tightness in your chest. This happens because you close your heart. The heart is an energy center, and it can open or close.
