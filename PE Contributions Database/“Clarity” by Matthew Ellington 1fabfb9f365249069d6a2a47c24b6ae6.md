**“Clarity” by Matthew Ellington**

Solitude, it turns out, can be a wonderful thing, insomuch as it provides a chance to clear one’s head of the many distractions that narrow our vision and stunt the potential that is gained from a broader perspective on life. I’ve found that it is this newfound clarity, for those of use given no other choice but to accept it as a fact of life in a place like jail or prison, that can allow us to better see as never before.

In the outside world, we live in such a blind haze that we scarcely see much at all. We become deadened to our sense of awareness of not only ourselves but everything around us– the people in our lives, the messages and images fed to us by a society pumped full of subliminal media, and a hyper-sensitive culture that seems to resent freedom of thought. The problem is the fast-paced, technologically-aided-and-assisted framework our lives are fitted into which encourages us not to think about it.

Take, for example, our growing dependence on social media. I used to believe, like many others, that its purpose was for me to keep in touch with all of my “friends,” but as time has passed, I realize that what it gave me was merely a false sense of connection to those people. It is incredibly easy to pretend to be a part of someone’s life because you instant message them every other day on Facebook, but when you take that away you find that many of those “friends” won’t continue that pretense because it is no longer afforded by convenience.

When we are removed from a society that is constantly smothered with subliminal influences and trending social phenomena, the solace can be an enlightening experience if we allow it to be. It can open our eyes to the real world around us and allow us to see what we may not have before and to better appreciate things we’ve taken for granted.

Obviously, the greatest insight to be gained is of ourselves- of determining who we really are, and where we are headed. Even the great philosopher Socrates recognized this when he said, “An unexamined life is not worth living.” One must reason, then, that to take an opportunity to step back and evaluate yourself- our strengths and weaknesses, our dreams and fears- is required in order to truly be permitted to live. In the same way that an architect inspects the foundation of an area before he finishes his blueprint, we must see who we are at the base in order to build ourselves into all that we can be.

We all live in our own fog. Maybe it’s out in “that world” and maybe it exists in a world of steel bars and concrete. Maybe it’s drugs or negative social influences. Maybe it’s your own doubt, guilt, or fear. Whatever it is, whatever may be blurring your vision, I believe that if you can take time to retreat into the quiet of your mind, away from the pressures of the world, you can find clarity.
