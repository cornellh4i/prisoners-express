**“Mother and Son” by James Stevahn**

Jennifer and her son Alan stood there. Jennifer let her son soak in the sight.

“What do you think?” Her voice was shaky.

“Is...is it ours? Truly ours?” He whispered. Tears escaped her eyes.

“Yes, it’s ours. All those long hours at the factory were for this. It’s my birthday gift to you.” Alan hugged his mother still staring at a two bedroom fixer upper on five acres.

The white siding was peeling everywhere giving it a unique texture. The screen door and shutters on the right ground floor window were leaning against a column of the rolling roofed porch which wrapped around to the side.

“There’s a little work to be done. Being the man of the house I’ll need your help. What do you think?”

“It’s perfect,” he said. The grass was almost the same height as the fenced in grassland between them and Big Shine Lake. “Can we go inside?” His eyes were gleaming with excitement.

Jennifer grabbed two sets of keys out of her stonewashed jeans. She handed Alan one set. Once the keys hit his hand he sprinted towards the exhausted house laughing. Jennifer wiped her tears and followed her son.

Alan’s dad was killed in a logging accident when he was younger. His mom couldn’t afford a lawyer so the settlement they got barely covered the funeral costs and tied them over till she could get a job. She swore to Alan one day they’d have a place of their own.

Alan had to shove hard to get the creaky door open and stood frozen. The living room was bare, just a stain filled greenish carpet greeted him. On his right was a wooden set of stairs that led to the second floor. The far back wall was an opening into the kitchen.

Jennifer stood behind her son. They had yet to enter. “Well? What do you think? I know it needs work, but we can make it our own over time.” Alan was still silent. Jennifer looked down at her son.

“It’s beautiful mama,” was all he said then entered the house. The floor creaked a little under the carpet. Jennifer followed Alan into the bare kitchen. The cabinets were a dirty lime green, lighter where the appliances once stood. The floor had worn to a yellowish white linoleum with a crack where a table had been. Through the dirty windows were some ancient looking oak trees.

“That’s where I’ll build the coolest treehouse.” Jennifer smiled.

“Yes Buddy, you will. Do you want to go check out the bedrooms?” Alan spun around and sprinted for the stairs. She turned and followed at a more human pace.

At the top of the stairs, squished between two small bedrooms, was a small bathroom with a bathtub, single vanity, and a sickly looking toilet.

“Mama, I want this room.” Jennifer turned towards her son's voice. The room he chose had a spider webbed cracked plastered walls, a simple closet, and two windows that looked out over the nearby state forest. He turned to her “Have you looked at your room yet?”

“No,” he took her hand and led her out the door across the landing into the other bedroom. Its walls were mostly intact plaster and the wooden floor had a slight buckle along one wall. They stood in silence taking in the view.

Alan turned and hugged his mother. “This is the bestest birthday present ever. I love you mama.” Tears instantly fell from Jennifer’s face.

“I love you buddy, I love you too.” She knew everything was going to be alright.
