**"Breakfast" by Matthew Aldrich**

Breakfast is my favorite meal, and it always has been my favorite. I cannot recall the last time I missed breakfast. I can even remember what my mom cooked for breakfast 40 years ago while I was waiting for the school bus. I can also tell you what has been on the breakfast menu for the last two decades because it has not changed much.

I lived in a 19th century farmhouse. The electric poles never reached down that last mile of dirt road in that corner of the countryside. Before breakfast, I would refill the ten, plastic, five-gallon buckets with water from the small creek that ran beside the house, carry in armloads of firewood in the winter, and then milk in our Jersey cow, Daisy. During my morning travels, I would slop the hogs, and feed the dogs and any other critters that may have been there. Although they were chores, the thought of my mom preparing breakfast on the old gas stove with her big, cast-iron skillet helped keep me motivated and my enthusiasm high.

After the morning chores were done, I would sit down at the family table in the kitchen with my little sisters, and my baby brother in his highchair at the head of the table. It was a large, rough-cut, hardwood lumber, picnic table, which my dad had built with his chainsaw, hammer, and nails. It was covered with a plastic, red, checkerboard tablecloth. The school bus turned around at our house, so we had to get busy and finish eating breakfast before it arrived.

My mom would prepare various breakfast meals. Whether the pantry shelves were full or bare, she always managed to put a spread and fill us all up which was no small task with me at the table. My favorite staples were eggs, bacon, sausage, venison, pancakes, french toast, oatmeal, cream of wheat, corn flakes, puffed rice, and toast.

Ma would really mix it up too. Your eggs may be turkey, duck, or chicken; and if you did not like turkey or duck eggs she might fool you into eating them. The bacon and sausage were from our own hog. The venison was canned in a pressure cooker on our gas stove, sometimes out of season depending on demand. You could also make special requests for pancake shapes, from an apple shape to a zebra. The cooked egg on the french toast was as thick as the bread, and the maple syrup came from the farmer down the road. I would slather them with butter from Daisy. Oatmeal was served hot and thick. Ma would buy the biggest cylinders on the shelf. I can still see the Quaker man watching over our breakfast. When the Quaker, or cream of wheat, came out, so did the bag of brown sugar, syrup, and butter. When we gorged on cornflakes, or puffed rice, from bags as big as your leg, the pure-cane sugar bowl would need to be refilled afterwards. With every breakfast, we had toast that was heated and browned over the flame of our gas stove using an antique toaster made for the job. To dress up the toast properly we lavishly spread on homemade jam and jelly, and sometimes, cinnamon.

I would wash down every breakfast with daisy's fresh milk. Many mornings the milk was still warm from her udder. Sometimes I drank a gallon every day. My dad said, "That is why I bought a cow!" We often enjoyed orange or grape juice too. Ultimately, I never remember going without breakfast, and I am grateful I was taught to eat breakfast. It is a blessing to me.

In prison, breakfast remains my favorite meal. I eat my portions, and then I look for more. "Hey, Buddy; are you going to eat that?" my favorite breakfast meals are now the ones served with oatmeal. I trade my pancakes or coffeecakes for more oatmeal. Although I cannot flood it with Daisy's milk and pile it high with a mountain of butter and brown sugar, I still experience a warm, satisfying feeling that reminds me of home. 

I will see you at the breakfast table!
