Laughter is an awesome thing. It heals the mind. Anytime I’m having a bad day I watch comedy on TV. It could be a comedy sitcom to a stand up comedy special on HBO or comedy central. It’s kinda weird, but I couldn’t see my life without comedy. A lot of my old philosophy is based on ideas I got from stand up specials. If I didn’t have a comedy in my life, I would be more of a pessimist. I enjoy when even non-comedy shows use comedic relief. I always make time to watch a comedy sitcom at least once.

This year 2015, I took time to accommodate Dr. Ken into my life. As you can tell, my idea of laughter leads to TV. Yet I also enjoy a good joke though I can never remember them, but when I’m told a joke, I always blurt out the punchline. As far as joke telling goes, some of the best joke tellers I met are also some of the smartest people I’ve met. Something that is very important in joke telling is timing and delivery.

It’s said that women appreciate a man that’s funny. I personally like to draw in women with my talents. I consider myself a renaissance man, and being able to be funny is a good ice breaker. I feel comedy is a part of keeping women involved. So laughter is an important thing in our lives. You’d be surprised how differently we would all act if we went 2 months without comedy. That actually sounds like an interesting and messed up experiment. Messed up because I believe that if someone went without comedy for 2 months or more, they would act out in violent ways. Given that we may already know the results of said experiment, we may now know why some people are just hard to deal with. It is because they don’t allow comedy into their lives. Just so you know, I easily watch 7 hours of TV per day. I bet you mean people watch zero hours of comedy per week.
