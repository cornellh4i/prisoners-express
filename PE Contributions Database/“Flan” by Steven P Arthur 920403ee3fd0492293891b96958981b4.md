**“Flan” by Steven P. Arthur**

****I don’t ever remember having a nickname. When I was a kid, everyone called me Steven. If I got in any trouble, Mom would call me by all three of my names, not always in the right order; it depended on how upset she was. In high school, I played sports, and my coaches and teammates called me by my last name, Arthur. When I put high school behind me and started a career as a paramedic, I was often called Mr. Arthur.

My brother Lionel’s life was just the opposite. When he was a baby, they called him Lionel Choo Choo, as in Lionel Trains. Later when he became a teenager, he was somehow embarrassed by his name. So once when being introduced to a new acquaintance, the man misheard Lionel’s name and asked, “Did you say Flannel?” We all got a kick out of that, and it stuck. We called him Flannel for a long time, and eventually, Flannel became Flan. Even after almost 20 years, some still call him Flan. Just a few years ago, I discovered that flan is a type of dessert. I wonder if he knows that?
