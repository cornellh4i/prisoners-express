**“Saving Mama” by Leo Cardez**

We had to try and save Mama--it was as simple as that for my twin brother, Scout, and I. When you’re 10, it seems all of life’s difficulties can be easily solved by courageous acts. This was one of those times.

Mama got sick and lost her hair. She went to the hospital, but they sent her home when she slipped into the coma. “Nothing more we can do,” they said. But, there was.

We heard Daddy yelling on the phone. There was a medicine that could save her, but it cost a lot of money. We didn’t have a lot of money. Santa always brought us clothes; we saw Mama knitting and Daddy making toys.

In the movie, the bank robbers wore a woman’s stockings over their faces and got away with a lot of money. We snuck into Mama’s room to borrow a pair of hers. She was so still, so pale; the breathing machine was loud and scary and it smelled like medicine, but we made sure to kiss Mama on the cheek and let her know we were going to save her before we left--her cheeks were cool to the tough, but she moved ever so slightly that we knew she heard us.

We were putting on our disguises the next morning when Daddy walked in on us. “What are you doing?” he asked. We explained our plan, hoping he would help us. He sat us down and told us we were good sons, but it was too late; Mama went to be with Jesus. We all sat together and cried for a bit and then Daddy went to get the camera--he said he wanted a picture to remind him of how brave his boys are.
