**“The Big City” by George Dominiguez**

The first time I was released from prison, I was sent to Houston. I really didn’t want to go there. I didn’t know anybody there. I asked my parole office for a transfer to Austin. I’d never been there before, but had seen nice pictures in a magazine. My hometown is San Antonio, but I left when I was 13 years old. I’d been told Houston was big, but I didn’t seem like it to me. I lived there for four and a half years. Don’t get me wrong, Houston is a beautiful place, but, for some reason, San Antonio looks bigger to me. I don’t think I’d really like living in a big city. I would prefer to live somewhere small. Somewhere where there’s not too many houses and apartments right next to each other like in big cities. Some people like big cities, but it’s not for me.
