**“When Life Gives You Positivity, Make it Count” by Christopher Velthuysen**

Awaiting a positive piece of paper from the parole board is stressful and in order to make it through there is positivity or belief in (whatever) your future holds - God - the almighty Father of Heaven and Earth has your best interests at heart. I’ve always felt this as I’ve been denied by the parole board three times now. I’m a juvenile lifer who was sentenced to a guilty but mentally ill plea bargain of no contest, but according to R. Douglas Fields, PhD, this is an “oxymoron” concept. As Dr. Knappes is quoted in the book by R. Douglas Fields, PhD, page 87: “If you are mentally ill, you cannot be guilty!”

I’ve always felt this but once my attorney got me to plead guilty, I’ve been at the mercy of the parole board.

I have to have “faith” in God, our Creator, or there is no hope! It all comes back to positivity!

To make positivity count, I’ve been taking correspondence courses on different topics of interest like poetry, book building, art and chess. I’ve also been trying to enroll at Delta Community College - 1961 Delta Road- B-134-University Center, MI 48710; and have to come up with $14146.00 not including textbooks, postage and proctor fees. And since Michigan doesn’t have any Pell Grants for inmates (Thanks Obama), I’m back to nothing, no education (except my GED). No wonder so many inmates that are “released” on parole go right back to what they know (drugs or robbery)!

I’m trying to not go down that road but the system almost forces you to do so! I say though: make your positivity count for something and for me. I cannot after my 32 year in prison not count for nothing so I have to maintain my faith in God and make my positivity count!
