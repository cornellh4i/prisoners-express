**by Christopher Cross**

At age 14, my schooling came to a halt due to a series of bad choices. Immediately, manual labor became everyday life. Pops told me, “If you ain’t going to school, you’re going to work.” Dad owned a small bricklaying company called Cross Masonry. My father, brother, a few hard working laborers and masons, and me made up the crew. Eventually, I would become one of those hard working laborers.

Hard and grueling it was, at age 14! I learned about the rope and pulley in school, and now I experienced pulling bucket after bucket of mortar, tong after tong of brick, up to the various levels of scaffolding. My young body learned to respect lifting and carrying those same buckets. My fingers became accustomed to the rough texture of brick, especially during the winter months. In the summertime, the hateful sun became my worst enemy, and the cleansing water, my best friend. I’d gratefully rinse away that dry-mortar mix that greasily matted with the sweat upon my skin.

Looking back, those were the greatest days of my life. The work was like a firm authoritarian: I hated it, believing it was cruel, but now I realize it only held my best interest in mind. This is what I keep in mind any time that I am exercising on the yard, ready to give up. One cannot enjoy the fruits of his or her labor, of course, without the labor. Who can grow a flower without first planting the seed, then devoting himself to nurturing it?

Hard work is now the cornerstone of my life for which I thank my dad and that first job he provided. After that initiation period, I went back to school which lasted until I screwed up again. Maybe it was just that the construction lifestyle was calling me home, because I was glad to be back out there. The lifestyle was my pride and joy, and still is.

Next time it will be different, only slightly. Nine years after that first job, I might be back out on the jobsite, but it will be heating, A/C, and ventilation. That is fine by me. Hard work can be done everywhere, if you have the heart for it.
