**“Flags of Release” by Raymond Swanson**

When I was sent to prison, my high school sweetheart went on with her life and had three kids. So when I was approached three years into my sentence to literally fight for my release, I couldn’t sign the dotted line fast enough. A GPS device was placed under the skin of my left thigh, and I was taken to rugged terrain with only a backpack of basic supplies and told to find my way back. I made the thirty mile trip in a day and a half, having never slept. The second person to arrive was my cellmate, Dave, and he was six hours behind.

Our first challenge was a simple paintball challenge. Anyone hit five times was taken off the roster of fighters. Of three hundred participants, a surprising two hundred fifty moved on. The fifty taken down were the decoys. I was a decoy too, and got lit up four times, but evaded the fifth shot.

A week later, we received notice of our second challenge. It was some twisted “Capture the Flag” game where the first hundred eighty to tear off a part of the flag would move on to the final challenge. Dave stayed up for two straight days stressing the unknown. Somehow he’d gotten a map of the area smuggled to him, and we looked it over to find it was a deep valley that would have armed guards at the top, spanning the whole ridge. Two ways in, two ways out. Once you got back to the ridgeline, you’d be loaded on a bus and sent directly to the third and final challenge as long as you had a piece of the flag. No flag=no release.

I fell asleep with my old girlfriend on my mind, wishing I’d put a rock on her hand. I was abruptly awoken by the cell door slamming shut, and Dave throwing a set of fatigues on my bunk. They were in rough shape, but the pockets seemed to be intact. There was also a shoe box open with two breathing masks, a five foot selection of aluminum chain and another five foot section of something resembling rope, a very ragged piece of rope.

“I guess we ought to stick together,” Dave said. It was then that I noticed he’d shaved his head. He was right though. The short sections of chain and rope would be of little use alone. Keys jangles as the guards came to wrangle all of us fighters.

We were on the bus a mere forty-five minutes when we veered onto a dirt road. One bus and another group of vans followed us, while the other buses continues on the blacktop. From the map I remembered that they were going to the other point of entry. One hundred twenty five inmates would be at each point. Suddenly we jerked to a stop, and the old doors squeaked open. We empties off the bus into the dusty parking area.

We were lined up shoulder-to-shoulder along the ridge when a trio of guards approached Dave and escorted him behind our bus for a search. He returned about five minutes later, visibly disgruntled, to his spot in line. No one known when it would be time to go, but after four eardrum shattering beeps and a shotgun blast, everyone just sort of ran into the unknown. Right away the guys on our left lost their footing and began to tumble down the hill. One lost his boots while the other dropped his section of chain. I picked it up, and we ran past them before they had realized.

Men’s creams could be heard along the entire hillside. Rattling chains and shouts of agony and injury echoed through the treetops, growing faint. Suddenly it occurred to me that we weren’t going anywhere near where we were supposed to be. I stopped, and Dave nearly ran into me. “Where the hell are you sending me,” I asked him. I was getting angry thinking someone that I thought was my friend was essentially leading me back to prison.

“Okay, just listen,” he said. “They’re all positioned together, and we’re going right through them.” I was confused, but joined Dave on the ground. He stuck the blade at a rather obscure angle and passed out right there beside me. Without a second though, I grabbed the knife, finished the cut and reached into pull out the device. I quickly put the gauze on it and wrapped the leg once with the tape. Then I cut my own skin and pulled it out. I used the leftover tape and wrapped my leg. Dave came to and said he couldn’t feel his leg. I had no idea where to go and Dave was nodding out again.

“Smoke screen” was all he said. I looked behind us and saw smoke rising. I put my mask on, threw Dave over my shoulder and headed for the hills. My adrenaline was high of Dave was lighter than I’d thought. Today we share a six-room cabin in Pennsylvania. The fight ring was illegal anyway, and no one ever looking for us. That was thirty years ago.
