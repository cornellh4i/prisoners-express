What makes time old and golden? Memorable? Timeless? Do you think what I think? That the older you are the more golden and memorable the memories of the good ol’ days? I am a thirty-two year old male and twenty years ago? In the so-called good ol’ days? Most laptop computers were more than $2,000 in price. I was stuck using 56K modems and I had a companion named IBM ThinkPad 380 XD. The year was 1997.

Golden? 1997? Nah! Memorable? *Yeah*! First trip to New York City! Got a laptop for Christmas - MY FIRST ONE! OK, let’s dig deeper...1988? Golden? *Hell yeah*! Memorable? Not really. I was only four years old. What made it golden? Well…

1988! My first trip to Disneyland! Anaheim, California. Just saying “First trip to Disneyland” seems to me like a memory you would consider golden! Would you? Here’s the problem. I barely remember Disneyland. All I remember was the trip we took to this display of Gloria Estefan in Disneyland, or was it in Vegas, and...that’s it. I know, I was a unique and weird child. How did I know it was Gloria Estefan? I liked listening to her music! At age four I was an Estefan FAN! “Get on your feet / And make it happen” was the song blasting through the speakers.

That made it *golden*! I saw Gloria on huge, gigantic TV screens singing for me! Man was I happy, dancing like only four year olds could with a huge smile on my face! Too bad camcorders cost an arm and a leg in ‘88 or else you could be watching me dance on Youtube! Imagine that! Me and Gloria Estefan at age four, that is another story...look for it in next themes for the year!

There are some things in life one never forgets! Even at such a young age. I can hear Gloria Estefan singing for me like it was yesterday. The golden sights and sounds are always with me, fresh and new. Age has no effect on such memorable and golden memories to treasure, don’t you agree?

Ah. I cherished my childhood, those good ol’ days, and music was all part of it which I will share with you through my upcoming stories. Stay tuned...
