**Queen for a Day by Catherine LaFleur**

It’s an intense game and I am not in the same league as the best players. You have to be quick and brutal. The girls play by tournament rules only. You’d better have all the two letter words memorized and there is no looking in the dictionary unless you are going to challenge someone else’s word play.

The game is Scrabble and I’ve never beaten the opponents who invited me to join today’s game. I’m at least a hundred points behind. I duly withdraw my tiles from the bag, then I spy the impossible. The tiles suddenly coalesce before my eyes into a whopper of a word. A spot is open on the left side of the board and its a triple word score. Then I not that I could get two triple word scores by placing a U and an N at the front of my word. I carefully direct my attention away to the right side of the board attempting to appear as if I am trying to build on a word already laid down in the lower right corner.

The second play lays down tiles on the right side triple word. Filthy. Everyone knows it’s a word so no challenges. While I'm waiting for the number three to take her turn, three spells out danger. Her word is in a spot that will actually help me giving me a ten letter word.

I pause a moment staring at the right side of the board, player two smirks and asks if I’m having a problem. With a beatific smile, I lay down my word.

U.N.R.E.Q.U.I.T.E.D

There's a moment of silence as the other players take in what I’ve deposited. Player one’s mouth is open because I stole her spot, but I’m busy tallying up my score. Two triple word scores, Unit and Unrequited plus (T)old and (Q)at filling in. Don’t forget to add my 50 points bonus for using a seven (+) letter word.

Elah! Ha. Ha. and Ha! I stand and take my victory lap around the table. After than no one can catch up to me. Yes, I am the Queen, the crown is made of grass and I wear it well. But only for a day.
