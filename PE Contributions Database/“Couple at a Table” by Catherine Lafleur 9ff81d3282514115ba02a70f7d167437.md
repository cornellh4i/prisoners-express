**“Couple at a Table” by Catherine Lafleur**  

There are many pangs people suffer. Being of French extraction the worst one in my opinion is this. Every time a French person sees something interesting the question isn’t what is that? It’s should I put my mouth on that and roll it around in my tongue? I’m sure Mr. Derek Lecomte, knows of what I speak.

I have an ongoing list of bad things that have been in my mouth. First up is a lovely experience I had at age fifteen. I was lying in a hammock on the back porch of my Great Aunt Mamie’s house. Her son, Rube, a true good ole boy came up with his dog, Tick. He sat down and put his spit cup (masquerading as a Hardees large drink cup) right next to my ice tea (also in a large Hardees cup). Unsuspecting, I put my hand down grabbed “my” cup and took a healthy swig. And then rolled right over into the Azalea bushes on the other side along with a stream of vomit. This definitely qualifies as one of the worst things that has ever been in my mouth.

As a young woman, I lived in Reims, France for almost two years with friends of my grandparents. I learned how to cook a few French dishes. Every Friday, I would go out to the butcher shop for special sausages. They were sold, joined together. Plump whitish looking things. When grilled they were juicy, sweet and mild. So delicious. After several weeks of enjoying this delicacy, I asked the butcher what they were made of. Horse meat. I struggled to remain cool and French but inside I was screaming because I'd been eating Black Beauty and My Friend Flicka. Another item that qualifies for the list.

At camp Prisoney Land, I’ve been able to add to that ever expanding list. As a treat, I bought myself a BBQ sandwich named Eighteen Wheeler. It was a beautiful blue sky Florida day. I had a frosty Co-Cola and a hot sandwich just waiting to be bitten. Yummy tummy. About half-way through the sandwich, I crunched down on something. Hmmmmm, what is that? After I swallowed, I opened the rest of the sandwich. There, lying in the state was the back half of the roasted cockroach that had just gone down the hatch. Tick another item on the list.

The food at Camp Prisoney Land has been fairly good lately. When you go to the chow hall everything is hot and tasty. However, if you are in the special Housing unit, the food arrives on a food cart and is substantially less than hot. Of course this affects the taste. Some of the people I see down there complain about this. A valid complaint but not really fixable as the food cart has to travel a significant distance from the kitchen to the destination. Really, my clients can’t complain too much. After all I do read all their disciplinary reports and I know the frequent fliers who keep going for the same thing over and over again. Girls, I know for a fact this semi-warm food is definitely not the worst thing that has ever been in your mouth.

As to some of the other items on my list of worst things that have ever been in my mouth. Well, gentle readers, I must draw a veil of secrecy over those other items in a don’t ask, don’t tell sort of way.
