***Not Like Us* by Steven Arthur**

It was the wolf’s eyes that stayed my finger from pulling the trigger. Through the magnification of the high powered scope, I could make out the finest details. Large in my crosshairs, he was two hundred years away, the scope brought me right next to him. I couldn’t miss.

His fur was an angelic white as pristine as freshly fallen snow, except for a dark gray mask and matching socks. The wolf’s size was unusually large and muscular, not like the scrawny things we normally see this time of year, but not impossible. Not like his eyes. Not the typical feral, shining eyes that I was accustomed to seeing in those Northern mountains. But soft, peaceful and blue.

While I contemplated this strange sight, the wolf was inching through the foot deep snow drifting further and further away. He wasn’t aware of my presence. White a steel colored sky, heavy with snow overhead. I found myself down wind of him, just like my Pa taught me. It would’ve been nothing to kill the wild animal, but I couldn’t. Something inside pleaded with me to let this one go. Normally I would’ve deferred to Pa, but he wasn’t there. Hell, I wasn’t supposed to be out. He was out on one of his monthly solitary hunting trips and I was supposed to be tending to be tending to his cabin. If Pa knew I was out here trying to make my own kill, he would have my thirteen year old hide hanging over the mantle, instead of whatever buck, moose or bear he bagged.

It was below freezing but still not cold enough to freeze your spit in mid-air. I was getting cold though, I had been laying in the snow for hours, waiting for something to walk into the clearing.

I pushed away the strange feeling and any doubts I had, then pulled the trigger. I knew I had hit it. From that distance I barely heard the wolf’s yelp, but I watched it bolt into the thick woods trailing a thick line of blood.

There was no rush to follow. Pa had been teaching me how to track animals since I was in diapers. Besides, I knew this one was injured, and running straight for the river. It had nowhere to go.

Picking up the trail was easy, I followed it for about half an hour. The blood trail thinned and the tracks became larger. Previous experience told me that meant the animal was nearly out of blood and dragging its paws. I heard the laughter and the gurgling of the river as I came up to the slope that would lead down to rocky, snow-melt engorged river. From the crest of the rise, I expected to see the limp carcass of the wolf. Bleeding animals tend to find themselves moving toward water. Pa says it’s because of an insatiable thirst from blood loss.

Instead of the dead wolf, I found Pa. He was naked except for the hair that the good Lord had covered him in and splashed with blood. I moved faster towards him as I watched him dig around at his left hip. He was hurt. Then without a sound he pulled a nearly perfect bullet from the wound and looked up at me without surprise. He picked up his shirt from the pile of his clothes and wiped off the blood from over the wound that was no longer there.

That was how I found out that we weren’t like other folks and why we lived out off the grid in a modern age.
