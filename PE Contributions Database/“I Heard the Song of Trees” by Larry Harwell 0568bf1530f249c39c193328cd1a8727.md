**“I Heard the Song of Trees” by Larry Harwell**

On a sweltering summer afternoon, Helios had sapped my energy in that sultry summer type of way. I lay down at the base of Grandfather Oak to rest my tired puppies. Sleep soon overcame me, and the dreamland led me away from troubled times.

When I awoke, I found that my head was entirely encased in a bole that had grown out of the trunk base. I could breathe, for there were holes where my nose ended. I could see, for there were holes where my eyes were. But I could not get my head out. Now some of my ancestors might muse, in a bit of an Irish brogue, “Now isn’t this a fine kettle of fish. Saints preserve us!” But I also have other ancestors that lead me on gathering paths. Black Crow Dancing has taught me that every atom in the universe in my teacher, so I decided to relax and see what Grandfather had to teach me.

As i quieted the monkey mind, I slipped into awareness. My hearing became attuned to the din of a bustling city. Leagues, rustling as if applauding the arrival of the wind, creaking limbs, like sore muscles being stretched in gentle movements. The flutter of feathers as birds flitted amongst the maze of twigs, limbs, and branches.

I could hear wood boring grubs, like dwarves mining for gold in Minas Tirith, gnawing their tunnels. *Peck, peck, peck. Tap, tap, tap* of a nuthatch and a woodpecker probing for those dwarves. ICould hear and see the claws, digging into the barks, as an opossum with three babies clinging to her back, make her way down the trunk. I could hear a deep rumbling laughter. Was Grandfather ticklish?

I could feel the vibrations of the cicada’s call. It made my ears tingle. I noticed a beautiful monarch butterfly resting on an exposed root. I could just detect the soft *woosh, woosh, woosh* as she slowly fanner her wings. A dryad was sitting next to me gazing intently at a dung beetle, like sisyphus, rolling a veritable boulder with its future young safely tucked inside. The sound was not unlike that of the stone rolling away from the tomb of my favorite Avatar.

This was a sacred tree. Enlightenment was gifted to me without words being spoken. We peaced out with each others company and my dream vision ended as I returned to the senses realm, realizing like Elijah’s servant whose eyes were open and knowing that those for him for outnumbered his enemies. *Selah*.
