**“Modern, Love” by Nate Lindell**

This photo brings to mind both the seemingly miraculous technological advances of our present humanity and the loneliness that seem to pervade us. It reminds me that there are lonely people out there, not just me in here.

I could’ve crafted a story to better drive home this point (within fiction we can often teach a truth that’s better absorbed than can be relayed through a finely reasoned essay), but I’m hopeful another writer will do so, and this note will alert readers that such was the conscious or subconscious aim of that writer.

Keep at it Dillon! :)

Love and Respect,

Nate
