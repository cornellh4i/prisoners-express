**"Smoke" **by LeRoy Sodorff**

After pulling her in

and lighting her fire,

a constant companion

to fulfill my desire.

Then the coming-of-age

and an assorted affair

Alcohol and “smoke”

made far quite the pair.

One at my fingertips

in my hand the other

kool on my lips

and the other my lover.

I gave up one

though parting was hard

and letting go of the other

on the day I was barred.

The alcohol long gone

my butt in the can

the hourglass turned over

now running out of sand.
