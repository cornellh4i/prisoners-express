**Gratitude by Jeremy Brown**

I love the word “gratitude.” Even when I’m very critical and pessimistic, being grateful to the Elements and the Universe and family and friends pulls me through another day. I am grateful to my judge for allowing me the opportunity of a lifetime: the time to pursue many subjects that interest me spiritually, mentally, and physically. I was such a terrible mess out in the free world. I was definitely mentally enslaved due to my limited conditioned programming. I have found my true path through yoga, magic, and meditation. I really would be afraid for myself if I had not awakened as quickly as I did to my own truth. It might have taken many lifetimes for me to see what latent curiosities lay hidden in my sub consciousness. I am grateful for attaining a small drop of the big picture so I can help those who are asleep. I see now how much I took my personal freedom for granted. I have all my limbs; I’m healthy, able to think for myself, and drug and medicine-free except for the occasional reefer binge. What more could someone want? I’m not bitter at my situation; it only occasionally makes me sad because of the missed opportunities. It would be a great practice if all of us could wake up and meditate on or contemplate what we are grateful for. Even if my life gets really sucky I’m still grateful for being alive.
