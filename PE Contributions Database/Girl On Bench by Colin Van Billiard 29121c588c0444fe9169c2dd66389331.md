"Girl On Bench" by Colin Van Billiard

Marisol was a very beautiful young Spanish girl who lived with her grandparents in the States. Her mom came to visit and asked if she wanted to go back to Puerto Rico, but Marisol decided to stay and find herself in her new community. Marisol’s two closest friends during this time included her best friend Ella and a second girl who was twelve years Marisol’s senior and smoked cigarettes incessantly. Marisol had begun to pick up the deadly habit.

Marisol had a crush on a boy in her class named Red Dot. The two were inseparable. They often found themselves purchasing candy and eating together in the school’s drab cafeteria. Each day that they spent time together, they found themselves growing closer and falling more in love. Their path was steady and the future looked bright for them, until the next day. Marisol’s and Red Dot had the worst argument they had ever had, and Marisol didn’t know how they would manage further. In response, she stormed out of the room.

Marisol found herself in the local park and decided to lay on the park bench on her stomach, smoking a cigarette. Red Dot searched for her diligently throughout the park until he saw a cloud of cigarette smoke rising from Marisol’s favorite spot. Red Dot walked slowly to the bench, told her to put out the cigarette and tried talking to her. As Red Dot and Marisol talked, they grew close and he kissed her intimately on the forehead. He then asked that Marisol not smoke again. Red Dot loved Marisol so much that he couldn’t stand the thought of the consequences of her smoking. After their reconciliation, the two walked home together, hand in hand.
