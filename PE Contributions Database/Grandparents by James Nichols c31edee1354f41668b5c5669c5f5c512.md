****Our mind is our own worst enemy, and so is regret. Prison gave me ample time to think about where I’ve been and where I wish to go, and an opportunity to change. Although I can change my mentality, I cannot--as much as I wish to--change the past.

These past seven years I’ve spent reminiscing about the time I had with my great grandmother, has shown me how precious and fleeting time is. Incarceration has given me a new appreciation for my grandmother, a woman I took for granted. Because of this, I am haunted by regret. My mind is continually assailed in remembering my failure to spend time with her while I had the chance. Although I often attempted to justify my actions by pointing to the fact that I was merely a child at the time, I struggle to comprehend the effect my mischievous and foolish behavior would have had on not only myself but on my grandmother as well. The fact remains: the moments I had with her are gone, and now, because of my actions, I must live with the self-inflicted pain.

They say there is no greater act of love or sacrifice than giving of one’s life for another. Unbeknownst to me until I was informed in recent years, my great grandmother made such a sacrifice and expressed love for me and my sisters. Food in Mrs. Murphy’s (my grandmother’s) home was scarce, and what little there was often contained more dead insects of various sorts than actual food. Little did I know, Mrs. Murphy had been starving to death slowly in order to feed us. At the time, the government would give her one meal a day as a senior citizen, and she divided this amongst my sisters and myself. This resulted in a quick deterioration of her health, requiring hospitalization. My sisters and I were taken to live in a foster home at this point.

While living in her home, I followed my elder brother in terrorizing the chickens and ducks, creating all sorts of havoc around the property (there was quite a bit of acreage). Although, at seven years of age, I could see how my behavior hurt her, I did not desist in my delinquent behavior. Yet, she never stopped loving or sacrificing for us.

In retrospect, I wish that I could go back in time and amend my past behavior, spend more time with her, and express how much her sacrifice means to me. But this cannot be done, and so, with great sorrow and anguish, I must go on.

Not one of us is promised tomorrow. Life is full of uncertainty. Knowing this, does it not stand to reason that we must make the most out of every opportunity presented to us?

Finally, grandparents, so often neglected and taken for granted by their posterity, are oftentimes the individuals in each of our lives who have made the greatest impact on us, who showered us with affection we could not get from uncaring or indifferent parents, and who made that ultimate sacrifice for us, showing us the greatest of love. How many of us have grandparents who are still living? Do we let them know how much they and their sacrifices mean to us?

To those who would brush aside my essay as meaningless or as of no importance, allow me to say this: do not allow the opportunity to spend time with your grandparents to be squandered. If you do, you will end up like myself, hoping for the possibility of a reunion in another life with the chance to make amends as your only consolation. Your only assurance and companion in this life will be regret.
