**by Kathryn Clement**

Hello. I was born as Kathryn Arlene Clement. Yet have been called several nicknames! Kathy, for short of Kathryn. KC picked up in high school due to too many Kathys and Kathys, crazy! Some have called me Kat, Katrina, Kathleen, and when they realized that’s not my name, I’d say, “It’s OK, better than being late for dinner!” (Lol.) Hummer, the humming part of me. Drawer - for I’ve always enjoyed drawing. Desira - this was for the part that pleases *all.* Desires… Blocker, the one that holds memories too hard to deal with. Queen Souverite - Desira Truth - Speaks the truth of her kingdom - Lol. Kace - short for KC. Been called a lot of other nicknames not so nice, yet I am a child of God. His special treasure, holy priesthood, peculiar, odd - weird. I am His, He is mine. Isaiah 54:5.
