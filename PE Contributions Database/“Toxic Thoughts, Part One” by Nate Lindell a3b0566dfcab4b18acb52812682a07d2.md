**“Toxic Thoughts, Part One” by Nate Lindell²²²**

One evening in the winter of ‘97, while at a house party, I almost came to prison earlier than I did. I was a college student, chasing a Marketing degree, had two beers in me, was chilling despite knowing that I was a prime suspect for the murder that eventually put me in prison.

Then some muscle-boy came in, a guy I’d been in jail with, a guy who thought he was tough because he was in a gang and though he was cunning because he was drunk. He put his arm over my shoulder, as if we were pals; I did likewise, playing along. Then, as we strolled to a doorway, in a greasy voice, he called me a bitch. He tried to ram my face in the jamb, which I expected; I hip-tossed him -full somersault- through the doorway, on his ass, where he spouted threat and more insults.

In the blink of an eye, I became Mr. Hyde.

“Where do ya keep the knives?!” I called out, looming over that pseudo “Bad” boy. “I’m gonna cut his tongue out,” I growled.

While never-incarcerated readers may think I wasn’t serious, I meant it. Fortunately, there were no knives in the kitchen and a girl I knew grabbed me, dragged me outside and distracted my fury by inciting other instincts.

Many of us are in prison for “decisions” acted out in the blink of an eye, or a series of “decisions” that we made while our higher mentation was trumped by desperation, as can happen to those with P.T.S.D. Thus it’s worth understanding how such spontaneous f’d up “decisions” work and erupt.

The word “decision” is wrapped in quotes because it is commonly understood to refer to the impossible: someone with a miracuously free will, objectively contemplating the forks in their life’s road and “choosing” the one they’ll amble down. The problem with that religiously inspired1 theory is that your **will** comes from your **mind**, your mind comes from your **brain**, your brain is made of **matter** and not only is matter affected by other matter (energy too is matter- e=mc2) but the brain is an organ designed to be affected by material experiences.2 Laws of both physics and neuroscience make any theory of “free” will impossible.

So, we don’t have “free” wills. But we do have wills and highly developed prefrontal cortices, which generally enable us to consider our options and potential consequences before we act out our wills, like a chess game, ideally, generally.

But we “decide” many things in the blink of an eye, based on **instincts** (e.g. fight-or-flight from a perceived danger) and/or **emotions** (e.g. anger, desire), both of which came into play during my near tongue-ectomy. We may analyze shit afterwards, but, “What’s done cannot be undone…”

Those of us who’ve been raised/ trained in environments saturated with fear for our safety, worry about where we’ll get money for food or rent. We were anguished about our bodies being violated by someone who’s supposed to care for us, or one of the other 10 most widely recognized Adverse Childhood Experiences (A.C.E.s): exposure to such “**C**hronic **T**oxic **S**tress” (C.T.S.)3. These environments can train us to overreact to perceived threats or stressors, as I did at that house party, as many of us did when we did the things we did that landed us in prison.4 In such cases, it is not rational or justifiable to condemn such people by claiming that they “freely” “chose” to do something that hurt themselves- no **sane** person chooses to hurt themself, but that’s what we did by committing crimes (I’m not addressing those few prisoners who plotted, deliberately, to prey on others, as politicians often do).

You learn things in prisons and other dangerous environments I’ve been in, such as: there is no escape when you’re threatened and calling me a bitch is a threat, that severely punishing the violator is your safest “choice”, your only choice, even if the administration punishes you for it. Violence and threats at home prepared me for that education. From reading Sheila LaBarre’s essay “The Vow” and Dillon Gresham’s essay “Guardian Angel,” as well as from many conversations I’ve had with fellow prisoners, I know that I am not the only one in prison who scores 10 on the A.C.E. survey and was trained to overreact in ways that I’ve seen shock most people.

It’s a little comfort, knowing I’m not alone.

I hope it comforts others, knowing that their past mistakes are not evidence that they’re “evil”.

Those who’ve been through C.T.S., who score high on the A.C.E. survey, if you can, check out a Mindfulness group, try yoga, which helps me calm down.

My Best,

Nate

1For Westerners, it is hard to accept that people’s wills are not free from their past experiences/ training. It is hard because it has been hammered into our Zeitgeist that we have “free” wills, as part of our monotheist heritage. (God would be a monster if he damned sinners who were born or bred to sin in a particular way, such as homosexuals, addicts,etc. Our society would likewise be “evil”...)

2If a person’s spirit or soul is not made of matter/ energy, is immaterial, then such a spirit or soul cannot influence their brain and thus does not “matter” when considering the nature of our wills.

3In a 23 Feb. 2018 episode of PBS Newshour (see pbs.org/newshour), Nadine Burk/Burke Harris explained that C.T.S. can cause something like P.T.S.D, which has often been misdiagnosed as A.D.D./ A.D.H.., something that I personally have experienced.

4In Jame Rivers’s theme essay, “Anchored by Immaturity,” he gave us a typical example of someone overreacting to stressors, one after another, until people got hurt and he got sent to prison.
