**"Isle of Isolation" by Jonathan Holeman**

If you want peace and calm, seek loneliness. Seek an isle of isolation silently somewhere. Go to a perplexing pessimistic prison, your own version of a hollow heated hell. Actually an anywhere, as long as you're alone.

Suffer false perceptions. The foremost illness of horrid hunger. The pains of fabrications, what could be, what would be, what should be, but isn't. Accept this truth, push away useless things as if they no longer exist, because, in reality, they donâ€™t. It's only a perception haunting the melting mind. Never allow this fear, anger, rage, to keep you from thinking that love for everyone, loving them all everywhere is just a cowardly concept, immoral, and the ruin of nobility. Everyone only sees what an individual appears and presents themselves to be, yet, very few experiences what that individual really is. As the lotus can only grow from mud, moral nobility can only span from the realization of past mistakes.

Become the isle of isolation. The serene clarity of solitude as waves crash upon these sandy seashell shores. The wisp of whirling winds whispering in brief gusts and dreadful gales. The tides spanning evermore, that ebb and flow fastidiously and forlorn. The tranquil still, and quiet sky, patient and composed.

Be this isle of solitude, and know in your loathsome livid loneliness, the flames of righteousness are bitterly bestowed.

You are the isle of tranquility in a tormented torrid trance. You're your own bountiful betrothed. Buried in bliss, and a humorous hellish holiness.
