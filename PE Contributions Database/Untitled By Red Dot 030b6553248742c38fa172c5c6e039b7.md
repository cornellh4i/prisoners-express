Ginger was at a club drinking and was having a good time. A man by the name of Mike came up on the dance floor, started dancing, and gave Ginger a drink. She sipped it and about 20 minutes later, she was feeling really drunk, stumbling. Mike grabbed and carried her out of the club, put her in his car, and took her to a hotel. He laid her on the bed and made love to her. The next morning, Ginger woke up with no clothing on. She just brushed it off and took a pregancy test. She was pregnant; she was very happy. She told her girl, Meeki. They were close. Meeki said that it was a messed up thing that happened but that something really good came out of it. 8 and a half months later, Ginger was rushed to the hospital. The baby’s umbilical cord was around the baby’s neck and the baby was dead. Meeki was at her side in the delivery room. The dead baby came out and Ginger cried. They held hands as Meeki said, “It’s going to be ok. He’s gone.” As they walked out of the hospital, Meeki lit up a cigarette and went home.
