**Cave by Daniel Chairez**

Tranquility, mist, dew, fresh sage,

gradient, time trickling by, peace,

triumph, accomplishment, man, wilderness

The world beyond, the city life that awaits

Should I stay, learn to survive off the land,

Leave everything behind, will they notice

Would they care, I’d like to take a piece

Of this with me, I’d like to declare this

My personal domain, out of the darkness

And into the light I go, I emerge a new

Man, I’ve ventured where very few men have,

This rock is my stone, and the wild is mine to tame
