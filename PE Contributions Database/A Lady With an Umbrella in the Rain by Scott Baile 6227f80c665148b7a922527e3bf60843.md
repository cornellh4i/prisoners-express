***A Lady With an Umbrella in the Rain* by Scott Bailey**

It started raining just as I sat down, and not that I was expecting it to rain or even thinking it, it just seemed right that it should rain at this particular time.

The vinyl awning kept me dry as I sat on the metal patio furniture. A couple of cars lazily drove by on the narrow one-way street. The tightly packed apartment buildings on the other side of the street each had a short set of stairs that led to a recessed alcove.

I kept my eyes on the alcove that led to the apartment where I was told she would be. I wasn’t spying and certainly not stalking! Actually, I didn’t want to see her there. I was hoping that four o’clock would come and go with no sign of her.

I began to wonder exactly what it was that drove me to leave work early to come and sit in a hard metal chair on a rainy afternoon. Was it that I loved her? If it was love then why did I have so many questions in my mind? Was I afraid? Did I come all this way to sit in the rain because I was afraid the stories were true? Maybe I was sitting here because I was tired of hearing it from everybody else and I had to see for myself.

For about ten minutes, it rained so hard that I could barely see the alcove. At least nobody would be coming out in such a downpour. A drip of water gently landed on the top of my head, and I looked up just in time for a second one to land on my left cheek--great. I inched the metal chair to the left to avoid the new discomfort and glanced at my watch again. Five minutes till four.

The rain suddenly stopped, and from somewhere to my left, an orange cat sprinted across the street. As it ran, I wondered how it seemed to avoid disturbing the puddles of water. I started thinking that the cat had the right idea and that I should leave. But then the cat went into the alcove I had been watching. Seriously?! Crap! How could I leave now? Was the cat a sign? Some sort of omen?

I looked up and down the street asking myself again why I even thought about coming out here. What if I did see her? Would I approach her? No. I couldn’t find the courage to ask her about what I’d been hearing. How could I find it to confront her here?

It started raining again. Not as hard as it was but a heavy drizzle; just enough to send hundreds of rain puddles into a frenzy of movement. I watched as the ripples collided with one another and wondered about the effects we each have on one another’s lives. Will we ever know to what degree we influence everyone around us? Every action we take, every decision we make, the ripples collide in so many unforeseen ways.

I was interrupted by my watch beeping, and I glanced at it to confirm that it was four o’clock. I looked up and had a fleeting hope that I wouldn’t see her after all. I was eager to accept that I had wasted my time and that all the stories were just lies. It was then that I realized that I really do love her. I was here to vindicate her: to prove to myself that I could trust her.

The orange cat appeared again and sat down just inside of where the rain was falling. It looked out at the rain as if it were a mighty king looking over his kingdom. Regal is the word for it; a sense of self-confidence and peaceful understanding. The cat and I seemed to look each other in the eye. He licked his whiskers as cats do, and I saw his ear twist back as if he heard something behind him.

Fear gripped me instantly. My belly flipped, and my whole body tensed as I heard the unmistakable sound of her laugh. The cat rolled his head back to see behind him, and I noticed I was holding my breath.

I forced myself to breathe and tried to convince myself that it wasn’t her laugh. It sounded like her laugh, but this laugh was more...happy.

I heard a door close, and then I saw her. As she knelt to scratch the cat on the head, I could see her smiling profile as she softly spoke to the cat. He was already lost in her touch, and as usual, I was captivated by just seeing her. But it occurred to me that I wasn’t captivated by her beauty anymore. I was looking at her in horror. All the stories about this apartment; all the lies about who I thought she was; all the promises and hopes and dreams that were shattered by her being there in that alcove.

Maybe it was that I suddenly stood up and the movement caught her eye. Or maybe she could just feel that the cat wasn’t the only one caught in her spell. Either way she turned her head and looked directly at me. As our eyes met, she stopped smiling and stood to her feet. She lifted her umbrella and opened it in one smooth motion. The rain dripped off the front edge as we looked one another in the eye. It was an eternal moment where I finally saw her for who she truly was. I saw the betrayal as she turned and walked away in the rain. I watched and wondered if she could see that I would never love again.

She disappeared into the rain, and the cat disappeared into the alcove.
