People sometimes confuse faith with belief. Both involve a condition of the mind, but one is acquired, passively or even unwillingly, while the other results from a deliberate choice.

We acquire information about the world around us by observing it with the five senses. We form new beliefs by synthesis and analysis, but our processing of information is colored by our prior beliefs in an endless regression back to the womb.

Not every issue confronted by a mortal man lends itself to a simple process of classifying and categorizing known objects. Claims of agnosis (“I don’t know and I don’t care”) are often disingenuous. Each of us has a set of preconceived ideas upon which we base decisions, building from faith to faith in an endless progression to the grave.

Belief is a result of prior conclusions and a case of future conclusions. Faith is a result of deliberate decision and a case of future decisions. Conversely, our decisions manifest our faith.

“Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well. The devils also believe, and tremble; But will thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?” (James 2:19-20).

Sometimes our belief dictates an unpopular action. We say the end justifies the means. Sometimes our faith requires an apparently self destructive action. One might say, although it certainly seems less common, the means justifies the end.

We step out on faith everyday. Even the fool who calls himself an atheist or agnostic demonstrates his faith, however misplaced it might seem to me.

I knew my wife had an expensive habit. When I learned that she was using my children to finance it, I had to take drastic action. Many people believe I should have killed her, but my knowledge of the North Carolina “justice” system was incomplete. My mother wanted me to drop everything and go home. My faith didn’t allow a father to abandon his children to sadistic pedophiles. I could have taken my children somewhere in the woods or swamps and hidden, but they weren’t ready for that kind of life.

So I took a leap of faith and went to the courthouse and applied for domestic violence protection. My knowledge of the dirty, dirty South didn’t compel that result. My faith in God did.

I survived several attempts on my life and after years of struggle, won a court order for the salvation of my children. On advice of counsel, Pamela defied it. As I was getting ready to take a contempt petition to the courthouse, a corrupt cop came to my house and arrested me.

Seventeen years in prison have radically altered my beliefs about the courts and the P.I.C. not just in Carolina but throughout the U.S.A. My belief is based upon first hand observations.

If I had things to do over again, I would.

53 years ago, I sang, “I have decided to follow Jesus./ I have decided to follow Jesus./ I have decided to follow Jesus./ No turning back./ No turning back.” My belief has changed. Faith remains.
