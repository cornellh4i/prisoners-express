**“Weddings” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

We watched a really grand wedding last month. The British papers couldn’t pretend they didn’t know the soon-to-be duchess was a commoner of rather atypical lineage for European royalty, but they mentioned it only cursorily, and in carefully coded words- even the tabloids. Everyone loves Meghan.

There was another detail that has received too little attention. The bride did not promise to love, honor and obey her husband. She just married into one of the richest and most powerful families on earth and she’s already set a very bad precedent.

I’ve been to many weddings. I myself have been wed twice. Yes, twice. The first one didn’t fulfill her vows. I’m in prison now so you might have guessed correctly that the second one didn’t either.

My first wedding was in a beautiful stone church in Plymouth in what is now Massachusetts (when my family first settled there, it was in “the northern parts of Virginia”). Ann English sang. At the reception, Gordon (I don’t recall his last name) sang several songs and the Wes James band provided dance music.

Cathy had pinealoma. When we returned from our honeymoon, she had brain surgery and medical care from some of the best doctors in Boston and the world. She got depressed, took what remained of my life savings, and returned to her mother and her old boyfriends.

My second wedding was in an austere church in North Carolina. A reception followed with no music. Scores of holier-than-thou friends of the bride and a scattering of my friends and family chatted awhile, and then left Pamela and I to do the dishes.

My second marriage, regrettably, lasted seven times as long as the first. Pamela took everything I had, and had me put in prison.

I will always love Cathy. In the unlikely event that I ever get married again, it will be in a nice church with stained glass windows. I will never be able to arrange the pomp and circumstance like Prince Harry, but the bride will promise to love, honor, and obey.
