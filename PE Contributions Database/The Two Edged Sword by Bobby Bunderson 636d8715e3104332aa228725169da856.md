***The Two Edged Sword* by Bobby Bunderson**

The main ingredient for “chicken soup for the soul” is laughter. Laughter is cathartic, purging us of loneliness, emptiness, sadness, and on some occasions, physical pain. What laughter is not is insidious, but rather instantaneous. Laughter never involves remorse, shame, or guilt. The sole impetus for laughter is lighthearted fun and amusement. Laughing is enjoyable, when we laugh we don’t fume. Laughter is amusing, delightful, and pleasurable. It diverts our hearts away from hatred and bigotry.

Laughter is also diverse. Old ladies cackle, babies chortle, santa chuckles, young girls giggle, and drunks just whoop it up. Why have a bad day when you can have a good laugh? Remember, if you find that you woke up on the wrong side of bed, just hit your reset button and have a good laugh instead. If you’re truly upset, look in the mirror, laugh at yourself and life becomes clearer. The willingness and ability to laugh at ourselves is a true gift. Do you remember Heath Ledger as the Joker in the “Dark Night”? One of his lines resonates with me to this day: “Why so serious?”

There was a time in my life when I used laughter as a defense mechanism, as a weapon. It stemmed from my own insecurities, low self esteem and my lack of a sense of belonging. My fragile ego made it easy to laugh at (rather than laugh with) other people's shortcomings and faux pas in order to divert attention away from mine. I became an assassin, laughing at others. I had honed my sharp tongue to scalpel sharpness. Often the results I reaped from my derisive laughter was not only devastating to my victims ego, but often brought tears. Even more shamefully, the tears gave me a warped sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. My abuse of laughter was appalling.

Thankfully those days are far behind me. Today I laugh to heal, both myself and others. I don’t mind laughing so hard that I get a stitch in my side. Today, that two-edged sword impales my soul with only joy, not by impaling the self-esteem of others.
