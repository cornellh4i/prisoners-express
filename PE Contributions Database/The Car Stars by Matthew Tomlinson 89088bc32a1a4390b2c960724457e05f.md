"**The CAR Stars” by Matthew Tomlinson**

****You’re a trained writer. You’re sitting with your pencil poised. You await that firestorm of inspiration. Nary a candle flicker illuminates the midnight of your mind. What, Writer, can you do?

You’re a trained writer. You took Composition and Rhetoric (or CAR). Use your CAR training to push that pencil around the CAR star. How many times did your CAR instructors run you through the five points of that CAR star? It helped you compose great rhetoric. Start at the lower left point with your Introduction. Use 50 words to start your controversy. Move up to your main argument. Give yourself 150 words (about 15 sentences of 10 words each) to state your case. Top out with your Counterpoint. Budget another 150 words to attack your Main Argument. Come around to your Rebuttal. Permit 150 words to rehabilitate your Main Argument. Come down to the lower right to your Summary. You have 50 words left.

Yes, you’re a trained writer. You’ve produced dozens of 500 word compositions, but those don’t help you write your Next Great Novel.

Prisoner Express illuminates your path. Alyssa gave us the Creative Writing Exercise Program. She explained the five points of the Flash Fiction Star, just the CAR star relabeled! Start at the lower left with your Exposition. Allow 50 words to start your story. Move up to your Rising Action. Give yourself 150 words to start your protagonist and antagonist toward their main conflict. Top out with your Climax. Budget another 150 words to resolve the main conflict. Come around to your Falling Action. Permit 150 words to ease conflicts among your supporting characters. Come down to the lower right to your Denouement. You have 50 words to tell how everyone lived happily ever after or didn’t live so happy, or didn’t live.

You’re a trained writer. Alyssa showed you how to use the Flash Fiction Star to take your CAR star training to the next level. Prisoner Express will make you a trained, *published* writer! They’ve printed 22 of my products, and 6 more are scheduled. That’s how Prisoner Express will help you write your Next Great Novel, one chapter at a time.

*Sic itur ad astra*. Such is the way to the stars.
