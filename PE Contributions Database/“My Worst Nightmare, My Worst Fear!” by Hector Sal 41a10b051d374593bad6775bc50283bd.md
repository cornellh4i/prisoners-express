**“My Worst Nightmare, My Worst Fear!” by Hector Salazar**

Never realizing the fact that I’m away contemplating my own death, my emotional state of mind during these moments are irrelevant. The fact of matter is: at this very moment I’m standing next to the casket that I am about to be buried in, lowered into the cold, cold Earth. So, if you’re lost let me catch you up. “I’m dead!” Well as you may have guessed my earthly body is dead, my soul on the other hand “not so much”, I never would have expected I’d be dead and yet, still here watching my own funeral. As I watch the handful of family and friends that are here, all seven of them, I notice a woman in the background standing next to a tree by herself. So, it’s no big shock that nobody came to my funeral. My family are all bigots towards their own family and turn on you quickly. I have been an outcast my entire life, a drug addict, and a thief always getting locked-up losing everything I’ve gained every single time I get caught. If I end up in jail or prison, I would end up alone because nobody wants to be in a relationship with a person that’s not there with them, for them. And my family just disowned me even though they’re not perfect they still judge and look down their noses at me with a look of disdain, and disgust that they are even related to a person like me.

As I look at the ones that did show up, I can’t help but feel great anyway because these are the only family that matter to me, the ones that were there no matter what happened because they understand what the word “family” means. Anyhow, I end up looking back at the stranger by her tree and can’t help but feel as if I know her from somewhere. Yet, I cannot seem to place her, for some reason. I know for a fact that I know this woman. It’s starting to bug the heck out of me. “Who is she?”

It bothers me so much that I begin to go towards her. Maybe once I’m close enough to see her face I might be able to remember whether or not I truly know her. If only I could ask her name. Well, I could but, I don’t think she’d be able to hear me. I wonder if she came with the others or if she’s just observing. Done with a visit and just going by, on her way to her care and stopped to add herself, only at a distance. Maybe not wanting to feel like she’s interrupting the sad gathering of people that came to dutifully bury their dead. I started to think maybe she felt sorry for the sight. I mean seven people came to say farewell. Perhaps something in her heart couldn’t just allow her to continue on without showing a little compassion for the one that’s passed, adding another Amen to the end priest's burial reading. She looks up as I get closer and I stop mid step because at the moment I swear she looked directly at me. Almost felt like we locked eyes. Her eyes remind me of my youngest daughter. I have not seen her since she was seven months old. The exact same eyes, they even have that dot of light in them like she always seems to be catching a flash with them everywhere she looks. The sadness in her face takes away from the likeness that I begin to think it a coincidence. The pain she’s feeling is coming through and the look on her face is confusion mixed with love and loss. Maybe she’s saying good-bye to loved ones she only knew by name. I know the feeling all too well, so I share in her pain because losing a loved one you never knew is hard on you because you do wish you could have at least moments with’em. It’s even harder to say bye to a stranger that’s supposed to be a father or a mother or a brother or sister. I hear a voice of the priest break in on my thoughts, “Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.” God please have mercy on his soul and allow him into those glorious gates with open arms. In the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit, in Jesus name, we all say? In unison seven voices exclaim, “Amen!” I even hear the stranger by the tree say “Amen” under her voice. The coffins slowly lower into their final resting place.

Everyone comes forward and says their final good-byes. They even drop dirt on the casket. The last person to say good-bye was the woman by the tree she comes forward and stands over the hole and begins to cry. Her tears are purely genuine and she whispers three words that made me die once again. “Good-bye Dad.”

And it hits me, the moment I hear a voice. The pain drops me to my knees and I begin to cry because I realize this is my Judgement.

Then she says; “Dad, I hope you know that I don’t hate you for not being there for me growing up. Well dad sorry we missed each other maybe that’s the way it's supposed to happen dad. I love you, and if you can hear me I would like you to know one more thing. I FORGIVE YOU.”

She turns and raises her head high. She takes a long breath and releases it in a slow sigh of relief and finality.

“Aniya,” I cry out to her. I apologize for everything. “I didn’t mean to miss out on your life. Sorry, I wasn’t there.” I cry harder and get out. “I didn’t mean to let you down!” between sobs of pain. Alone; once more. I continue to cry, and cry, and cry. Aniya!

That’s when I wake up with her name learning my mouth and tears in my eyes. The pain is real even though it wasn’t happening. The pain is the tears are, and regret is completely destroying me.

I may have been dreaming, don’t you think for a second though that it wasn’t real because, I for one truly believe every single moment of that was real. “Yes, it was only a dream...and yet, I cry.”
