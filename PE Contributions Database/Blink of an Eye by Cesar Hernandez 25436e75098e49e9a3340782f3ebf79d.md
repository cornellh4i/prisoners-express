**“Blink of an Eye” by Cesar Hernandez**

****It seemed as if a brick wall hit me out of nowhere. When I can’t sleep, I usually go for a drive, sometimes a very long drive. At this point, I had had my 2010 Mercedes-Benz E-class for a few months. I didn’t have to worry about losing my radio station since I only listen to XM Sirius satellite radio.

I end up in a somewhat rural area. It is about two or three in the morning and pitch black. The automatic high beams are on and I have the cruise control set at seventy miles per hour. This stretch of highway consists of only two lanes, one North and one South.

One second I am going seventy miles per hour and listening to Raw Dog Comedy Channel on the radio. The next, I hit something big and am at a complete standstill. It happened so fast the E-class pre-crash system didn’t even have time to engage. I obviously blacked out since I didn’t even realize that all the airbags deployed. The steering wheel, knee, side, and side curtain airbags all deployed and deflated before I came to. The windshield didn’t fully crack, yet you can’t see anything out of it from how bad it shattered.

I still have no idea what happened. I’m primarily upset that the pre-crash system did not work as advertised. I have a T-Mobile and Sprint Phone, neither of which has a signal. I don’t expect the E-class to have a signal, but I still press the emergency button. I had no idea that the line was already live. The representative had been calling me but I didn’t answer since I had blacked out momentarily. The lady tells me that emergency personnel are already en route. Sure enough, I see strobe lights in the rearview mirror.

Apparently a horse decided to commit suicide by running right in front of me at the precise instant when I was driving down the highway. The horse had very shallow breathing and was moving a little so a sheriff's deputy shot it to put it out of its misery. The EMTs look me over and declare that the seat belt and airbags worked perfectly. Now I’m worrying about my E-class and how it might cost me. Thankfully, I had several things going for me. I was sober, I was going the speed limit, the horse came out of nowhere so fast that the pre-crash system didn’t have time to engage. I didn’t need medical services. The insurance company had no choice but to buy me a brand new replacement E-class.

I tested my new E-class to see how the pre-crash system works. I had my friend drive in front of me at sixty miles per hour and suddenly stop. The pre-crash system is engaged. Everything happened at the same time. The steering wheel pulled in and up away from me. The radio turned off and alarm tones sounded. The seat belt tightened and locked. The sun roof closed, along with all the windows. The seat lowered and pulled back away from the steering wheel, and the seat back was upright. One hundred percent of braking power engaged at a controlled pace and brought the E-class to a complete stop about twenty feet behind my friend’s truck.
