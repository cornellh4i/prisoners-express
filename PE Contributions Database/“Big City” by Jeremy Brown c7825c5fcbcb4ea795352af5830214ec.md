“Big City” by Jeremy Brown

I have lived in big cities as well as gone off-the-grid into the country. When you live in a city, you don’t realize how much noise there is. You receive a culture shock when you come back to the city from the country. There is a lot of violence in the city where I lived, Tampa Bay. A lot of gangs, a lot of pain. I’ve seen gang rapes, beatings, people get robbed and shot. I was numb and desensitized for a long time.

A lot of good things happen too: new housing areas being built, new and better technologies, lots of luxury, and plenty of food-- free food at the soup kitchens. There’s a lot of people, so you are not alone, but you feel that way because you feel out of place. At least I did.

Smaller communities are okay, but everyone knows one another. Big cities are great to just get lost in. You will always have problems, but that’s wherever you go. I never went hungry in the city, due to the amount of waste being thrown away. You can go to almost any Dunkin’ Donuts or Pizza Hut and speak to the manager to let them know you wish to feed the homeless, and most of the time, they will let you and give you the day-old food.

There’s plenty of diverse individuals to meet. Some strange, some cool, some very chill. I’ve mostly had more good than bad. You are always being watched by the cops, though. I’ve been watched since I was fourteen. It felt as if they were waiting to see the next time I would screw up. I’m never going back. I’m walking to the mountains next.
