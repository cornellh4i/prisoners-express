**“Let’s Eat!” by Carl Nunnery**

You see 4 dogs coming towards you at a dead run; their eyes are fixed on you. Their mouths are open, guess what? I’m looking for a place to run! In my mind, I’m thinking I must look like a “T-Bone” steak to them!

Wild dogs are not handed food for them to eat, they are forced to search for food and live off the land. Everything that moves is considered as food to them.

God does provide for “All” living creatures regardless of whether animal or human for their survival, it’s just that some don’t want to follow God’s plan to receive it! In (2nd Thess 3:10) it says, “if any would not work, neither should he eat.”

So if you don’t work how do they eat to survive? Many turn into that of wild dogs, searching for food, stealing food and taking it wherever they can find it! It’s true sometimes we do fall into hard times to where we do not know where our next meal may come from. This is when we have to turn our situation over to God. No he may not drop a cheeseburger and fries into your lap, but can place you into a job that will allow you to purchase food.

We can read in Chapter 16 in Exodus that the Israelites were in this very position; they did not have any food or water, and they had to trust God to provide for them, and provide he did.

We can find several scriptures of this dependence of God and his ability to provide.

Gen. 2:9 - The Trees for food to Adam and Eve

Ex 15:23 - Made bitter water sweet

Ex 16:4 - Rained break from Heaven

Numb - 20:8 - Water from a rock

Num - 11:5 - Provided vegetables to eat

Luke 5:5-6 - Filled Simon’s fishing net with fish

Matt 14:13-21 - Jesus fed 5,000

Mark 8:1-10 - Jesus fed 4,000

My point is this: trust in the Lord and he will provide for your needs just as he did in (JOB 24:5) God provided food to them in the wilderness, God will provide for us!

“All Things work together for good	to them that love God” (Rom 8:28)
