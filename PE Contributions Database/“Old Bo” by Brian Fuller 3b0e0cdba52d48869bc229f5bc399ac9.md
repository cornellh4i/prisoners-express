**“Old Bo” by Brian Fuller**

Nobody knows for sure the exact age of “Old Bo”. I found this out when I asked the cashier,

“How old is your dog?” She laughed and said,

“He’s not really our dog… he just likes it here.” Old Bo has become a fixture in this town. I know his owners love him and care for him. They live just a couple of blocks away. Old Bo wants a little more excitement than his aging master can give him. So every morning he walks up here to the stone and every evening he walks back home, just like clockwork.

He’s got a routine. He watches people gas up and get coffee before going to work. Then there’s the lunch time rush. A little piece of corn dog on a burrito really hits the spot. But the best by far is when the kids come home from school. All those little hands scratching him behind the ears or patting his head are better than sausage.

As far as I know, Bo has never bitten anyone that didn’t deserve it. He’s a better judge of character than most of the people I know. There’s never a need to get up and chase a bird, squirrel, or stray cat. A well timed bark usually does the trick. He’s got his share of aches and pains. We all do. Every now and then I see him trying to make himself more comfortable. He’ll get up, turn in a circle a few times, then lay back down.

So that got me thinking: what did he change? His position or his attitude. Perhaps it was a little bit of both. It was then when I realized that Bo had given me a lesson in life. Bo is an opportunist. When a chance comes along, he takes full advantage of it. He’s got it all figured out. Life isn’t going to come to us, we have to go out and get it. If we look for the good in people, we will find it. We might not always be able to change our situation, but if we change our attitude - then we’ve changed everything!

So if you’re in town and you see Old Bo give him a pat on the head and share one of your french fries with him. You’ll be glad you did.
