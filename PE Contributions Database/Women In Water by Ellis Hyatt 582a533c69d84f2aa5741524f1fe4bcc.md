**"Women In Water" by Ellis Hyatt**

Seeing this picture reminds me of Vietnam where some POWs and village people had to hide and sneak from one place to another to try to survive to go through the jungle. It also reminds me of communist Russia when everybody had to secretly sneak to a place where they were going to have church because they used to kill people if they were caught possessing a Bible. Sometimes the places where they held church were invaded. They always had to go from one place to another and find a new place to hold church because they were afraid of getting caught. They continuously had to move from one place to another, secretly holding the church to avoid getting caught and killed for having a Bible and for having church, which was against the rules. The communists didnâ€™t believe in God, and they also banned anyone from owning a Bible and attending church. They were risking their lives by trying to have church and to own their own Bible. This picture reminds me of a story like that because you can see where they look like they are hiding in fear of something the way they are easing along the water bank and carefully watching above their heads. This comes from stories I once heard about Russia, back when it was communist. It slowly faded out and they began to let people openly have church and own Bibles without having to do it in fear anymore. Today they have freedom of religion and read and possess Bibles without fear. This is pretty much what this picture theme reminds me of.
