**by Tommy Hightower**

When I was a baby and young boy, the era was 1958-1973. The Vietnam War was on tilt. New broadcasts showed war footage of people being shot in the head with actual brains bursting forth. There were also times of “Lassie” and “Leave it to Beaver” style families. Most all kids were raised by mom and dad, less often by a single parent. Parents were expected to raise their offspring no matter what--no excuses. I was abandoned by my parents at age 2 or 3. Literally, my mother took my sister, and my father took me. Her to Buffalo, Dad to Sacramento.

My father could not read, but went to work full-time straight out of 8th grade. He was struggling to survive. He lived with his mother, my paternal grandmother, and living there was a shame my dad refused to endure. So I was passed on to my grandmother, never to have a parental relationship ever again. I was an unwanted child.

Grandmother was already old enough to retire. Short of 65, she still worked part-time as a janitor for a trucking company, just across the Sacramento River from our home. She also owned a thrift store, right next door to a divine-smelling hamburger joint.

Grandma was alone without a husband due to a bitter divorce from the alcoholic. So dad was also from a broken home.

Being raised by grandparents was a stigma when I was a child. I had to fight every day at school because I was grandma’s baby boy. She treated everyone like it was the 1930’s in Oklahoma, so needless to say, I was beat, made to work hard as a child, and said goodbye to normality. That was then.

Today, most grandparents are either full-time caretakers of grandkids or part-time nannies for a single parent child of theirs. No longer is it a stigma to be raised by grandparents, and no longer do grandparents lead quiet, boring, lonely retirements.

The whole world has flipped over. Nothing is as it was. Is that a good or bad thing? It depends on the grandparents. It depends also on your own family dynamics. One thing for certain: seldom will grandparents refuse to accept the duty of being good parents to their grandchild who needs them. Thank God for grandparents. Amen?
