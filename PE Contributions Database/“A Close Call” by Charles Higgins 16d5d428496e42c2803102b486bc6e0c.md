**“A Close Call” by Charles Higgins**

It was just before my twenty first birthday, and I’d been out of jail for only a few short months. I was driving my girlfriend Sue’s new car when I saw the undercover cop car lurking out of the corner of my eye. It was parked across the street of my Aunt Marie and Uncle Gary’s street, turning in from the river.

I could tell right away that it wasn’t a speed trap. It looked more like they were waiting for someone, and of course, I was that someone. I had nothing to worry about though, if I did nothing wrong.

As the officer approached my window he said, “oh, Chip Higgins!” All excited like this was his lucky day. It was Detective West, in a car by himself, the someone who I lied to and strung along with no intention of cooperating at the age of fifteen. He wanted me to tell him about a string of auto thefts, all I can think of now is payback sure is a bitch.

Thinking back to my last time in juvenile services, at the bootcamp in Westboro, that officer who worked as a counselor who taught us to know our rights. Except this was a one-on-one, his word versus mine, and I knew how this story always went. It was never in my favor.

Now by the traffic laws, I’ve done nothing to be pulled over for. One may ask then, well am I following the law? I’m a young drug user who sells vast amounts of it in order to support my own habit, so no, not particularly.

I had only left my house for a quick ride to the store to make it look like I picked up some cake. I didn’t want David, the downstairs neighbor to know I was holding. I could go out, come back with his product, and then not only will he share his purchase with me, but I’ll make money too.

Detective West was sitting waiting on me. Almost like this was a set up. Well, fuck it I’m a be polite, direct and to the point, but I’m not putting the car in park. I kept my foot on the brake the entire time, waiting for another high speed chase.

All the while, knowing my brake lights were never extinguished, Detective West kept asking questions. I handed my license over, knowing I was clean there, he asked me in a misleading way, “do you mind if I search the car for anything illegal?” Just like the counselor warned me they would.

“No sir.” I replied as Detective West took it upon himself to open my door. I quickly closed it back and restated, “I said no sir, you can not search my vehicle.”

“What are you afraid I’m going to find?” Detective West resumed asking me again.

“Nothing sir, I just know my rights and I want them followed.” I stated calmly. I know my rights, thankfully to that officer in that juvenile bootcamp. Here I am, sitting with about a half ounce of cocaine on me, and a half ounce of free base, a scale and at least one pipe. Nope, I’m not worried and my foot wasn’t leaving the brake pedal. Luckily it was dark so he couldn’t see my knee steadily shake. I just couldn’t keep it still, my nerves wouldn’t allow me to.

“Okay, I’ll be right back,” Detective West stated as he took my license back to his car. He stayed there for at least twenty-five minutes. Ah, he’s calling back up and they’re going to beat my ass again. It’s all I could reasonably assume, why I would not take my foot off of the brake to put the car in park.

After that long drawn out wait, Detective West walked back up and handed me my license and told me to have a good night. He had no idea what a good night I was already having. No speeding ticket, because it wasn’t a speed trap. He followed me to and from my destination waiting for me to give him a reason to arrest me. I had enough cake on me to last about three days until I needed to re-up again, if I didn’t sell anymore. I shut everything down and stayed home for the next three days
