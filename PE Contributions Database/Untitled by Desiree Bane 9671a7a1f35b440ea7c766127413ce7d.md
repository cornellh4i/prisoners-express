Wow! What a trip to open this newsletter and see my own face staring back at me-- could it really be almost 40 years ago? 1977, I was 15 years of age-- not long out of juvie; left home at the “tender” age of 15-- standing there, holding up the wall at the HIgh Street Bakery in B-make; what was that chick’s name? Candy?? There I was, feelin’ footloose an’ fancy free. Explain the wonders of “The Block” finding my place in my natural element. Back before this cell became my world, before that last bid before the bullets slammed through my leg and before the babies burst forth from my swollen belly. Back at the beginning of my ride on the H-train-- that one boi I gave myself to completely. Chased that high all the way down through SW Texas, into Mexico for the China White… Man what a rush to roll through the memories-- through the bikers and the outlaws, past the oceans and the mountains-- here to this chaingang life-- where each day I wake up and put those 17 letters across my back that remind me that for now I belong to the DOC, but they can’t keep my mind, my dreams, or my memories locked down. Today I opened this newsletter and there it was… my ticket to ride out one more time and leave these walls behind.
