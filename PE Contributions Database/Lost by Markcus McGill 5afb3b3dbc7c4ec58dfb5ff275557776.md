Once upon a time I was lost. A dark and hopeless moment in my life. The painful scenes seems to cling with us the longest, why? The concept of one emotion etched in stone yet, a leaf travels pass. Are we as humans, program through generations of evolution, accustom to forget the sweet and remember the bitter. Objects control time; a lifetime to the primary, others simply notice minutes. The future's bleak when expected, expectations are unfavored. Amnesia steps in slowly. Who am I? WHat am i doing here? How did I get like this? Do I smile like this? Have I always laugh like that? Who am I, again? Is the question that is continuously ask of oneself, by yourself.
