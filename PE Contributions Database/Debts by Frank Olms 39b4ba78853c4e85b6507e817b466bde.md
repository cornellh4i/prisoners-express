**Debts by Frank Olms**

In prison, some inmates do business like Wimpy in the old Popeye cartoons --”I’ll gladly pay you next Tuesday for a hamburger today!” Problem is that Tuesday usually comes around before the funds to pay the bill: hence the debt. Here is what happened--

Today started like most -- disorganized! Sometimes I think there’s a method to the madness, and sometimes I think nobody knows what the heck is going on.

The morning count was miraculously accomplished with little fanfare and even less anticipation of anything good happening. After all, it is Saturday and the best some inmates can hope for is a morning of uninterrupted sleep. Somewhere around 8:00 AM, two twackers were having a very animated and vocal conversation about who owed whom the dope.

You have to remember that to smoke the coffee impregnated hand towels with bits of plastic, cleaning solvents, weeds from the yard, and anything else that they think will get them high, does not require a high level of intelligence. … And after smoking enough of this stuff, whatever intelligence they may have had quickly dissipates in a cloud of smoke -- literally!

The conversation quickly reduced to the inbred animal tendency of flight-or-fight. Being in a confined area, flight was not an option, so option number two was quickly entered into. Bodies bouncing off walls, tables, telephones, trash barrels, bunks, and then one of them grabbed a broom,

It was becoming nasty.

A spectator in the Peanut Gallery cried out, somewhat vociferously, “Oh no, not the broom!”... CRACK! The broom handle broke … somebody called the cops.

The cops just love breaking up fights. They came in -- guns drawn. No rubber bullets for these guys. These guys use spray-cans of … I think the same stuff the bad guys were smoking. Within seconds everyone was choking -- everyone but me, I have a window seat and the window was wide open. Fresh air galore. I did get a whiff of the bug-juice that was being sprayed and I have to admit that it did smell better than the twack shit.

The man .. I mean the nincompoop with the half-a-broomhandle did manage to land a couple of blows on the other guy before being overcome with the perfume of passion from the spray cans. Everyone was having a good time. New bracelets for both contestants and a trip to the hoosegow to cool down.

An inmate later said he thought one of the combatants was me. So I told him I was thinking about joining the fracas just for fun, but they seemed to know what they were doing and had the situation well under control -- more or less.

I don’t think the debt is paid yet.
