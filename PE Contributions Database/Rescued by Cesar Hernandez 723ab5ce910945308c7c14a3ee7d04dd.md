Back in high school there was this one girl who was excited that she was learning to drive. One day I need to drive with two girls. I insisted on taking my car, but she was adamant on taking her car and her driving. I was somewhat resistant but trusted her since I had known her for several years. She wanted to go to a restaurant that was about thirty-five miles away from school.

I had not seen her drive before. It was essentially a roller coaster ride. She had this old Dodge Neon that only had one airbag. The car looked like it would be detailed if it crashed into a tree, and there would be no survivors. The highway is six lanes, and she went all the way from the right lane to the left lane in one swoop. I tightened my seat belt even further. When we got close to the restaurant, she crossed all six lanes to the right at the very last moment.

We arrived. This car has no power locks. We get out and out of the habit of locking the car door. The driver gets out, and she locks her door. As soon as she closes the door, she realizes that she forgot the keys. They are still in the ignition. She checks all four doors, but they are all locked and all the windows are fully closed. I say we might as well go inside to eat while we think of something. She gets on her phone to find a locksmith. She finds one for eighty dollars and a two hour wait. We decline.

I get on my phone. I send a message to two friends who have all the tools needed to open car doors. They come to the rescue. It just so happens that they are both together and less than five minutes away. They were looking for cars anyway at that moment. We tell them to come and order food for them. Less than ten minutes later, they walk in with the car keys, and we all have lunch. I take the keys and drive us back to school, to make sure we arrive safely and the keys donâ€™t get locked in again.
