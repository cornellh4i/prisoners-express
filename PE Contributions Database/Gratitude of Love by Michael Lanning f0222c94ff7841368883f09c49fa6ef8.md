**Gratitude of Love by Michael Lanning**

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation is able to is able to separate us from the love of Jehovah that is Christ Jesus (Rom 8:38-39)

Nothing means anything. Nothing separates humanity from Jehovah’s love. Not wrongdoing, not wrong opinion, not wrong ideas, nothing!

Evangelicals dispute this, saying acceptance of LGBT is wrong. However, everybody’s belief is a something of the world, and the Bible assures us that nothing in this world can separate humanity from the love of Jehovah. Therefore, as one sin led to condemnation (Adam and Eve) for all of humanity, one act of righteousness (Jesus on cross) leads to justification for all humanity (Rom. 5:18).

All means all, not just some people, not just those who are rich, straight, conservative, or believe only what they choose to believe. All means all people, for all humanity, in other words, everybody.

So why do we want to love those we hate if it’s not necessary to get into heaven? Out of gratitude. Once you understand Jehovah’s amazing grace, you will want to respond to the love of Jehovah by loving everybody. Moreover, it’s Jehovah’s golden rule ---Love Jehovah with all your heart and love thy neighbor as yourself (Matt. 22:36-40)
