**“Next Lifetime” by Jevon Jackson**

“You’re charming,” Charlene smiled, looking off towards the band playing their soft, upbeat jazzy music.

“I know, I know It sounds like a pick-up line but what If It’s true?” Marcus gazed intently upon her light amber eyes. “What If we met In a past life and this Is just a reunion of sorts?”

Usually, Charlene came to this juke joint just to enjoy the music and hanging out with her best friend, but tonight her friend was preoccupied, at the bar, with her own date. Maybe It was the gin and soda smoothing her out and making her more social than usual, but she humored Marcus. He seemed nice and genuine, and she felt like she already knew him. She figured she would entertain him for the moment.

“I guess If you believe In past lives then you would have to believe In reincarnation,” she said.

“So you don’t believe In reincarnation?” he asked.

She softly shrugged her shoulders. She eyed her drink for a moment, then looked up at him. “I guess, In this big ‘ol world, anything Is possible, really.”

Marcus was trying to figure out how much to reveal to her. He didn’t want to scare her away. He had come too far. “Do you like stories, Charlene?” he asked her. “I’ve got a story that I know you’d appreciate.”

Before Charlene could respond, Marcus was leaning back In his chair, hand around his glass of cold beer, and off Into his story: “There was a man who lived a very unique life, or should I say, very unique lives. The thing that was different about this man Is that you know how some people can recall, In detail, each day of their lives by pure memory? Well, this man could recall every life he’s ever lived. Every reincarnation. The bodies he inhabited were different, In different periods of time. From a fishmonger In the pre-Crusade era of south Persia to a knight of the First Regency In the mid-1500s of royal Spain. Although each life was disrupted by the moral affliction that we all suffer from, his memory lived on, uninterrupted, from lifetime to lifetime. And for every lifetime his number one goal was not to be rich or famous or powerful, but It was to find that singular everlasting connection with his soulmate.

In every lifetime he would find her. In every single one. It didn’t matter how unlikely their connection would be, with the hurdles of class or custom or social rank between them. And It didn’t matter, the distance, what measure of land or expanse of sea, he would always, always find her. Although she looked completely different, physically, In every lifetime, the charity of her spirit and the endowment of her soul were always the same. True beautiful.”

Charlene was leaning forward, with her elbow on the table as her chin rested slightly In the palm of her hand. The way that she stared at him, taking In every single word, made him feel as If It was all coming together.

Marcus continued on: “With this man’s dedication and devotion, you would think that their bond would have a fairy tale ending, but there was always something that went awry. Either a war or a tragedy would separate them. And there were times when the folly of their youth could not overcome the opposing forces that they had to fight through, endlessly, just to stay together. In all of the lifetimes they shared, they never had the opportunity to grow old with each other. Not one.”

“That’s soooo sad,” Charlene said, shaking her head and turning her gaze to the floor. The band was now playing a slow, bluesy tune.

“So the man made a vow to himself,” Marcus continued, emphasizing with his index finger gently jabbing at the table. “He said ‘next lifetime, I’m telling her everything from every life time we’ve ever lived together so she’ll know what I know.’ Because he’s the only one that remembers It all, so he figured that will make a difference. To finally give them a chance to grow old together.”

Marcus leaned closer over the table. “And so, Ms. Charlene, this Is why I’m telling you this-so this lifetime will be different… different for us.”

Charlene stared at him, frozen unsure of what to say next or how to say It. It would break his immortal heart If Marcus knew that she had started to remember her past lives three lifetimes ago, and that what she remembered of their past two lives together was unlike anything of the romantic conjuring that he remembered. She had started falling out of love with him 600 years ago.

Marcus stared into her eyes, hopeful, feeling that this time would be different. Charlene looked out past his gaze, wishing eternity wasn’t such a long, long time.
