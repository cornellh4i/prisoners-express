**“The Hot Cold” by Robert Johan Richter**

Man is nearly extinct. Because most of the radiation hasn’t yet reached the Arctic, the wolves are still alive, still running. But time is running out. They will sicken and die, never knowing why. Most people don’t know either. All they know is that one day, for no apparent reason, nuclear reactors all over the Earth melted down and blew up. It was like Hiroshima. Not knowing provided no protection whatsoever.

Wolves don’t really know anything, not the way people know things. They hunt, eat, mate, and play, never planning for the future or arguing about the past. Their leader, the alpha male, doesn't know how he got that position, or how he plans to keep It. He just does what he feels like doing, moment by moment.

Most people are the same way. We hear and believe. We ignore obvious dangers, like neutrino weapons, because they are “impossible”, just as nuclear weapons once were. Alien species, far more rational, have us in the crosshairs right now. Men, wolves, squid, lichen: We are all the enemy, all doomed to extinction. Just as a wolf can’t outrun a bullet, or even see it coming, we will have no warning. Hot radiation everywhere, even in the cold snow. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

Earth physics is fantasy, not science or even science fiction. Humans are no smarter than wolves.
