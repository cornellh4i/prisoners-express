**Untitled by Ignacio Carrillo**

Every Saturday morning she put on her pink rain boots and helped daddy wash the car. It was her daddy-and-me time. It was the best--she could hardly sleep with excitement.

Daddy was always so serious and she tried her best to clean the tires the way he said, using the blue bucket, not the yellow. But, the best part was when they hosed down the car.

He’d grab the hose and rinse the suds off from the top to bottom. He would accidentally sprinkle her.

“Daddy stop!” she’d shriek (but she didn't mean It, she loved it). He’d just keep rinsing and sprinkling her. But, then It was her turn.

It was her job to wash and rinse the tires. She was careful not to squeeze too hard and the water came out soft and slow. She would also pretend not to see daddy and sprinkle his shoes, “Don’t you even think about it young lady,” he'd say. But, she saw the smile forming on the corner of his mouth. She squeezed hard and soaked while running away. He ran after her, catching her In his arms as they both laughed.

Daddy had to go. Mommy said he was sick and needed help. She wished he would come home and she could take care of him just like Mommy takes care of her when she's sick. Is Mommy going to send her away if she gets sick too?

Every Saturday she looks out the window at the dirty car and cries. Mommy took her to a car wash as an adventure, but it wasn't as much fun. She pretended to like it for Mommy.

She got to see Daddy again on Saturday, but it was at a special place. They had to wait and then Daddy showed up in his blue clothes (he always wears the same thing now). They get her any snack she wants from the machines and then they eat together at the table and talk. Sometimes Mommy gets mad at Daddy. Sometimes they play Go Fish. Daddy can't come home with us yet. He's on a time-out for driving too fast.

Daddy’s home now, but on Saturday she has Cheerleading or Volleyball practice. He doesn't wash the car anymore anyway – he just takes It to where Mommy took it. He’s so sad now. He always has to go to meetings – like, all the time.

She turned 16 today; Daddy is washing the car; he asks her to help. She doesn't want to, but he insists. They play their little game, she thought she forgot, and end up soaking wet on the lawn. He gives her the keys, “It’s yours sweety, happy birthday.” She’s crying, he thinks it's because of the gift. It's not. For the first time, In a long time, she feels like Daddy’s home.
