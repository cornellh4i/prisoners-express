**Close Call by Leo Cardez**

Summer of 2001

She still thinks I’m asleep. She tiptoes in already in her favorite white swimsuit with the tiny flowers and frilly waist holding her bright pink arm floaties in her little hands. She pauses, overcome by shyness, like she’s always done, peeping in, ducking out of sight, giggling in the hallway. “Cat,” I call out, “I know you’re out there. Come in.” She stomps barefoot in the way small children do when they’re still getting used to walking on their own. “Let’s go Daddy,” she half yelps as she jumps into my arms.

I promised her I would teach her to swim so she could join her brother and her friends at the local pool that summer. I’m taking her to a water park where I hope seeing other kids playing in the pools will inspire her and give her courage.

We are some of the first to arrive. The sun’s warm, gentle rays and the smell of chlorine welcome us. We walk past a noble lifeguard perched high above as he waves and smiles; Cat responds in kind as I explain, “He’s a lifeguard, here to help those that can’t swim too well.” She nods in understanding.

We take the cool plunge into the children’s pool and begin our lessons. She’s very serious and purses her lips tight as she flails her arms and legs following my instructions. But, like a bull dog, she quickly sinks to the bottom as soon as I let her go. She won’t be discouraged, but as the crowds begin to arrive, we’re forced to take a break.

She’s wide-eyed and slack-jawed watching the teens splashy arrival off the steep water slides. “Daddy, can I?” But before I can answer she races off and jumps into one of the deep landing pools. For half a beat I’m frozen then instinct kicks in and I dive in after her. “What are you doing Cat!? You can’t do that!” Her shiny eyes tell me I’m louder and angrier than I should be. She simply, without a word, points to a corner of the pool. I seat her on the edge and wade over. I reach down and pull up a small black child no older than my Cat. He’s blinking hard and spitting up water. I’m staring at him in disbelief, “Are you ok? Where’s your mom?” I look around sure that there’s a parent somewhere frantically searching for him. He just continues to stare at me as I place him on the edge of the pool. His breathing has relaxed, he turns away and sprints off. I jump out of the pool, but I’m too slow to reach him as I lose him in the midday crowd. I can only hope he’s heading toward some adult supervision.

I reach for Cat, “You saw him and wanted to help?” She smiles and nods, like the lifeguards, she explains. “I’m proud of you,” I’m barely able to choke out as I give her a big hug and promise her a giant ice cream cone.

Summer of 2017

Cat’s up early. No breakfast today, she doesn’t want to be late for her first day at work. She recently completed the lifeguard course and will now be working at our community pool. “I’m proud of you,” I yell out, as again, I find myself holding back tears. I still see that little 5 year old with her bright pink floaties. She leaves before I can embarrass her further.
