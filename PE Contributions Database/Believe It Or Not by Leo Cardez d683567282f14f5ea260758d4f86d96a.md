**Believe It Or Not by Leo Cardez**

Fear is one of the most powerful forces on the planet. It can steal our drive, subdue our passion, and kill our dreams — if we let it.

Prison is a place where fear can dwell in all types of dark corners; some we can see, others, the truly scary, hite in chambers of our hearts that have long been locked away.

We can’t be afraid to confront the dark stuff in our pasts. Not all pain is bad. Freedom can be found through pain.

Fear is a choice. We decide how much power we give it. Once we decide to leave fear by the wayside and follow our heart we will see and experience a refreshed and rejuvenated sense of purpose and hope.

It’s our choice whether to believe it or not, but either way, we’re right.
