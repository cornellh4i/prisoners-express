***Smoked Out* by Michael Chris Morales**

I was 13 years old, living in Staten Island, N.Y. when I took a hit of crack cocaine. I was looking for a 20 of powder cocaine, and this guy said he could get it. After I gave him money for the coke, he comes back with a little rock and told me it’s crack and just like cocaine but smokable. I told him I ain’t fixing to smoking crack and that I ain’t no damn crackhead. I was mad, and so he told me he’d just smoke it and pay me back my money, and that I should take a hit because I may like it. I said alright.

He pulled out a plastic soda bottle with a piece of a Bic pen sticking out of a hole, and where you drink from was aluminum foil with other little holes. He put asked in the top and a little piece of rock on it then told me to just suck in since he’ll do the rest. He lights the lighter and puts it to the rock, and I start sucking in air. The whole bottle fills up with white smoke. He says to blow out, catch my breath, and clear the bottle. I held the smoke as long as I could and blew out the biggest cloud I’ve ever seen. Immediately after, I felt different: I was smoked out, hooked. While I can’t explain the feeling, I’ve been smoking since; I’m 33 now. I don’t plan on smoking ever again since being smoked out got me in bad things. Five years ago, I was home with the wife and kids and decided to go to the bathroom to take a hit. Right when I filled my lungs with smoke, my wife knocks on the door and tells me to hurry up because she has to pee. When I didn’t respond because of the smoke in my lungs, she starts banging on the door. Soon, she knocks the door open, and since I didn’t blow the smoke out yet, I ended up blowing it in her face. She slapped me across the face and walked out. I still couldn’t talk because I was stuck on stupid. I got thousands of stories about being smoked out, but keep me in your prayers because I’ve been sober 4 years now!
