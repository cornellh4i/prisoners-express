**“Wedding” by Alex Benjamin**

Holy matrimony which leads to marriage and unity, as two become one. A man must leave his parents and join into marriage to his wife (Gen2:24). It is a beautiful ceremonial aspect of life to tie the knot to the person whom you will spend your entire life with, til death do you part. But one must not ignore the fact that love plays an important role in the journey of being married to one another, and this only can be realized by a true connection that derives from happiness, friendship, devotion, partnership, commitment, stability, joy and companionship, which forms a tight bond, an unbreakable bond.

“But”

The prospect of a wedding has lost its true meaning and value for which it stands. For people wed for society approval and hidden agendas, such as self-gratification. I’m married to a wealthy woman or a rich man for perhaps superficial profiles like beauty and possession. They lower their standards just to gain temporary satisfaction which last for only a short time. But God intended for us to have this union for us to grow old with each other til-death-do-us-part (1 Cor3:39)

In a wedding vows are exchanged, both parties, the woman and her soon to be husband proclaim their love to one another literally in words and indeeds by placing a ring to bridge the gap of separation and as a reminder to each other that we are linked as one. The world has exchanged the concept of being wed, which meant for a man to draw unto a woman into marriage and to grow old, yet today weddings are celebrated as a form of social event displaying a superficial meaning here today gone tomorrow, married and divorce(1 Cor 7:27) If you have a wife, do not seek to end the marriage.

The foundation of being wed has lost its flavor, which is the principle that it stood for unity.

Marriage, the state of being lawfully united to the opposite sex as husband or wife; an act of marriage(1 Cor7:14)... for the wife brings holiness to her marriage and husband bring holiness to the marriage(Gen2:24) God gave marriage as a gift to Adam and Eve. They were created perfect for each other.

Marriage was not for convenience, nor was it brought about by culture. It was instituted by God and it has three basic aspects. (1) The man leaves his parents and, in a public act, promises himself to his wife. (2) The man and woman are joined together by taking responsibility for each other's welfare and by loving the mate above all others. (3) The two are united into one in the intimacy and commitment of sexual union that is reserved for marriages, a strong marriage is how many guests showed up at your wedding or how huge the hall you rented is? Or the place you went for honeymoon, it is by centering yourself around Christ who is the cornerstone and the foundation which you and your spouse stands on, known as unity.

Next time you plan to marry someone or someone plan to marry you think of the true value and factors of being wed, there’s calamity, ups and downs, trial, tribulation and all intertwine into being wed are marriage also there’s hope, joy, love, kindness as well but most of all as long as God is first and is centered in the midst all will be well. So I ask you: let us get back to the basics of what’s important: living in Holy matrimony in love and in truth committed under God almighty.
