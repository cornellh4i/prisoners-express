It all started one winter in 1992. I just got home from the Kanner Center. I walk a lot around the abandoned farm property, but itâ€™s no longer. There I meet a doberman pincher. I called her Abby. She was a very beautiful dog. She was staying inside of the old barns on the property. I guess she liked me: she never barked at me or bit me. I fed her well. She was my angel. When no one wanted me, she came right up to me and put her face in my hand. Abby never got mad or jealous. She was the best friend I could have. She also went with me to catch crayfish and a big water moskusand or a snake. Abby got bit by the snake, but she was alright. I should have gotten bit, but Abby got bit for me. I found her dead a few days later curled up in a ball. She looked tired like Old Yeller did when it got the rabies. She did not get rabies. I also think it was the cold; the blizzard of 43 was bad, we got 50 to 60 inches of snow. I think she got frostbite. She was frozen when I picked Abby up. She was real stiff, frostbitten.
