**“Dog” by Teddy Lewis**

Your veil of innocence is a cloak of desire to the world.

Don’t we know each other?

From somewhere? It’s evident

That a possible tragic situation will

Turn positive causing you and I to meet.

So, I’m prepared to put all my cards on the table baby. This life is like

a movie scene but you can’t make

Anything up as we go along. Every

Second is a reality that cannot be scripted or acted and I’m sure

you know that. As you watch me

Drive away I feel your eyes on my

Soul and my custom made seven door

Mercedes Benz. I wanted to

Offer you a ride home yet

My conscience rides inside your

Mind and something in my

Heart tells me we will meet again.

- Peace

T. Lewis
