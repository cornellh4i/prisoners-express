****I really like this picture of the landscape in a mountain range. You got two small mountains on either side sloping down to a valley. Then you have the main mountain further up the range, and the blue almost cloudless skies are overhead.

I like this picture because I am a thinker. I love to look out over a landscape and get lost in my own thoughts. I think about life and the circumstances that got me to where I am. I think about what could’ve been, what should’ve been, and all the people, good and bad, that I’ve come in contact with along the way.

I also enjoy watching wildlife, birds, deer, rabbits, and all the other wildlife that live in the fields around the prison I’m housed in.

I am thankful because the prison I’m in is located about 3 miles outside the town from which it bears its name. So, all around the prison are fields, pastures, and some wooded areas. So, there is a large variety of wildlife that lives in the area. We even have some feral house cats that live in the area. Sometimes, I’ll get lost in my thoughts while watching out my window. I’ve even lost time, hours at a time, watching and thinking.

I also like watching storms, with the lightning, thunder, heavy rain, wind, and sometimes hail. During the winter, we get real heavy snowstorms, sometimes even with lightning and thunder. As I watch the storms, I often think about the poor suckers who have to drive in it. And while I feel bad for them I’m just glad it’s not me.

I wonder what kind of wildlife lives in the area where this picture was taken. Depending on the region of the world, I’m sure there are raccoons, skunks, of course squirrels, maybe bears, or big cats. There may be some mountain goats--I’m sure there are eagles, along with other birds.

I would really like to go camping and hiking in an area like that. I used to enjoy camping, hiking, mountain biking, and other stuff like that. But that was another life ago. Now, the closest I can get to camping is taking a nap on the baseball field at yard. No more hiking or mountain biking. Those things will definitely live on in my memories though.
