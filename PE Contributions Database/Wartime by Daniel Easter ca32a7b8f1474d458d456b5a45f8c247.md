**"Wartime" by Daniel Easter**

The devastation of the battlefield was heart-wrenching. Bodies of both the dead and the dying were strewn about like a child’s broken toys. It was the monsoon season and the field was deep with mud. The stink of blood and feces, mixed with seat, was worse than any hog farm or slaughterhouse I’ve ever been in.

The women and children were the worst. They had the eyes of the old, the wise, as they watched us trudge through the mud of the field. They’d clearly lost the will to fight. But they weren’t afraid of us. Never afraid.

I’d seen my share of women and children used as booby traps; grenades clenched in fists, dynamite taped around waists with short fuses, standing atop mines, waiting for a soldier to come close enough, then stepping off. Yeah, I’d seen my share of blood in my year in the hell of wartime.

Another week, and I’d be in the world. I won’t have to look in those eyes again. I know I’m fooling myself. I know I’ll see those women and children in my nightmares for the rest of my life.

I wonder what they see in my own eyes. Do they see a cold-blooded killer? Do they see the devil in my gaze? Or do they see a victim, like them?

No, I’ll never forget these women and children, or their vacant eyes. I can only hope they forget mine.
