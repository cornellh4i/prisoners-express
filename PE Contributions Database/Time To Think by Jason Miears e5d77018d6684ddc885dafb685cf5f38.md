"Time to Think" by Jason Miears

I usually come to this bus station to leave my mind idle. Throughout the week, all of the drama of life hits me pretty hard. Family, school, boyfriends, girlfriends, gossip. There is not a day that goes by that I can get a break. The “parasite” of the mind is what I call it. It’s like a million voices all talking at once. To get away, I usually head to the park where the old bus station is located. I first stop by a coined vending machine and always buy myself a Sprite. After slowly sipping on the delicious taste, my mind begins to relax. Once I arrive at that calm state, I live just to prop up on the little purple bench they have waiting for the arriving travelers to rest upon.

I can lay there for hours thinking about the love of my life. His name is David. I haven’t actually struck up a conversation with him, but he’s in my biology class. He’s tall, has brown eyes and has a very athletic body. He plays on the varsity football team. Every time they have a home game, I am always in attendance. The problem is that I can never get his attention. I’ve tried just about everything. I’ve worn risqué clothes, dropped my pen in front of him, I’ve even bumped into him on purpose. Yet, no matter what I do, he never looks me in the eye or even asks me my name. The drama of life really gets to me. I love this boy. As the night draws nearer I know tomorrow will be another day I can impress him. For now though, I’ll just sit here daydreaming of our potential love affair.
