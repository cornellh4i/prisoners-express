**“Flowers” by Bobby Ball**

The aroma suffocates the atmosphere

The view impeccable.

Daily devastations drastically destroy and disintegrate daisies

Decisions determine to declare drama drowns the daffodils

Danger dances with the daughter of darkness, a daylight debacle

Decorated with deception.

Death’s delicate description “depression diminished”

Red roses and red clovers regurgitated from the ocean

Reincarnated with resilience

Life’s longest living lily.
