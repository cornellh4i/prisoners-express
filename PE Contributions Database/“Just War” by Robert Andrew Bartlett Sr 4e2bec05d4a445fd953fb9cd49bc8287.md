**“Just War” by Robert Andrew Bartlett Sr.**

****The captain was late--again.

The usual low murmur slowly grew louder, but all the men in the room were seasoned soldiers who knew the importance of order and decorum. Sgt. Carmody was the first to speak up loudly enough to quell the whispering.

“Hey, Lieutenant, where’s the coffee? If you’re not gonna give us any coffee and donuts, I got work to do.”

There were eight lieutenants there, but none said a word. They didn’t have their orders yet, so there was nothing to talk about.

After a few nervous chuckles, the room was silent for several seconds. Then the door opened. The man who entered was not the captain. It was Corporal Agar. Someone said “Don’t take another step unless you’re bringing some coffee.”

When you’re on the front lines in a world war, coffee is very important.

“I have some news from the short wave,” Agar responded anxiously. He immediately had the crowd’s undivided attention.

When you’re in a bunker three hundred feet underground, news from abroad is very important.

“M5 has confirmed that the caliph is dead.” Agar obviously had more to report, but he was immediately drowned out by cheers, and by someone (Carmody?) bellowing “Well then, to hell with coffee! Break open a barrel.”

That suggestion was very well received. When you’ve been living on C rations, coffee, and peanut butter for six months, a celebratory flagon of rum can be very important.

A consensus seemed to be developing that the war would probably be over within another year or two. Bob knew better. Before he was vaporized, his grandfather had warned him the Jews would not stop until the temple was restored, the Mohammedans (That’s what he called Muslims) would not stop until the Dome of the Rock was cleansed, and the Americans would not stop as long as there was oil under the sands of Iran. Bob’s grandfather had been right about many things.

Agar was talking about the death toll from a new weapon technology developed by France, stolen by Russian spies, and sold to insurgents in Turkey. No one could understand much of what he said in all the noise and confusion, and Bob didn’t really think he could have followed it all, anyway.

A major victory had just been won! A few million civilian casualties were not important.

When the captain finally arrived, order was immediately restored. Appropriate salutes were made (rather sloppily, when you’ve been eating, sleeping, showering, and even using the bathroom together for two years, such formalities are not important). The orders, output by the computer on rice paper from a high speed printer, were quickly passed out.

Bob went to his cubicle, grabbed his mouse, clicked on the icon of an old-fashioned airplane (possibly a Sopwith Camel), and keyed in the GPS coordinates of a grade school in Sierra Leone. It seemed to him that there was something inherently unjust in killing children 1500 miles away. As soon as he said the word “launch”, his voiceprint appeared on the screen and his drone took off. In the third decade of a just war that had already claimed a billion lives, nothing was more important than following orders.
