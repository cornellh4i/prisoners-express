**Respite by Daniel Okken**

I love nature; many times I have been in this pictured place: it is a place of rest and tranquility before any journey’s end. The terrain has been steep and rough, and it brings sweat on my face. Mostly uphill, huffing and puffing, ‘round rock and tree, I wind my way, with a goal in mind; and with weary body, I brace myself to forge ahead, and never falter until reaching the point  I can rend from my innermost being the fear and anger that begalls the human race, and to where I can finally be refreshed by the Creator of life, my friend.

This place of respite and regeneration is not the final goal. The weather is chilly, no sun brightens the sky, and the climb is hard. The misty shroud makes the footing treacherous to top a knoll, and I slip and slide across every rock, like it was greased with lard. I made it to this sheltered place; this refuge, this fortress, this hole. And as I rest and am refreshed, I can relax and let down my guard from the trials of the trail - for here in seclusion I renew my soul, and take this time to pen with ink my thoughts, and act the bard.

I must move on now, for my rest is complete, my spirit renewed; my strength is sustained with natural food; and for the spiritual, the word. And as I look forward to what lies ahead, climbing to higher altitude. I brace myself to face rougher trials than this; and so I’m stirred to seek in the beauty about me, my God I meet so oft’ in solitude. Beckoned by the desire to experience the unseen, I’m called by the song of adventure heard.

So I leave the darkness and safety of a camp, by the hand of nature hewed; walking by faith this path that lies ahead, but be’er alone; of this I am assured.
