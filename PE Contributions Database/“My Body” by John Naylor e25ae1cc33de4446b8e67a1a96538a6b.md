**“My Body” by John Naylor**

Every shadow cast. From acid burn to thorns. And from thorns to blades. My body and the tales it tells. Some I recall, most really. Remembering isn’t the only factor in recounting the events that occured. I supposed I could live an easy, smooth life. A life with bumps little and one long grove. A grove I’d ride in conformity and monotony. Like the needle on a record player. Just playing the humdrum sound of a quiet life and living simple. Though that’s not my story. And whether I’m home after prison or not, or whether I never find the justice I seek that will not be my tale. I still remember the winter of 2004. I was in Washington Indiana. Daviees county. One day as jail commander Kenny walked away from my cell, he shouted “You can’t change your past Mr. Naylor, only your future!” How true, yet cruel at times how things end up. We’d all change some things here if we could. Though acceptance may be hard. To accept oneself, the wrongs done to us and our lives as they are may be the hardest thing we face. My body tells the tale.
