**Tip #72: Run for your Life by Leo Cardez**

I hated running. I only believed in running if I was being chased. I avoided running at all costs. I thought it was boring, difficult, and pointless, but, as per usual, I was wrong. The reality is, science has continuously shown running is one of the best things we can do for our overall health.

I’ve done the research and the findings are undeniable: running is good for us. The most jarring and consequential studies have shown running’s ability to extend our lives. (As inmates, we need all the extra years we can get - having wasted so many buried in these human warehouses.) Men’s Health magazine writes, “Running is great for a long life, and even a little pays off. Running just five to ten minutes a day has been linked to a lower risk of death.” Another study expounds on the subject by demonstrating that running can add up to 3 years to our lives. That’s regardless of age, weight, or how fast or far you go - according to a new report published in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases. Running lowers the risk of dying from any diseases by 40%. The math is relatively straightforward: an hour of jogging adds an extra 7 hours to our lives. I’m not a statistician, but that seems like a pretty good return on investment, but I suppose it’s up to each of us to decide whether that’s reason enough to lace up. But wait, there’s more!

Running is also good for our brain. A Men’s Fitness Magazine study found that running was the ultimate brain booster. Running pressure waves caused by each stride increased the supply of blood to the brain which could help grow new neurons and synapses which in turn create more (and better working!) gray matter, improves long-term memory and makes our brain perform like a younger person’s. Not enough?

Running is also good for your mental health. It’s been linked with reduction in stress and anxiety levels and an increase in dopamine and serotonin (feel good hormones) levels. Have you ever heard of a runner’s high? Well, it’s a thing and it’s real. What’s your excuse now?

But, I have bad knees, or arthritis, or joint pain - is a common refrain heard by run-avoiders (I’ve said it too). But, studies show running can actually reduce inflammation - the major cause of most bone and joint pain - and actually be good for long-term treatment of those types of body pains. In a report published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology researchers at Brigham Young University found that the benefits of running among those suffering from knee or other joint issues likely outweigh any potential disadvantages: especially when it’s done in moderation. Still not enough? Well, now you’re just being stubborn.

Not that we’ve established running is something we should all be adding to our self-care regimen, the question begs: How do I get started? Spoiler alert: There’s really no wrong way to run. Like Nike says, “Just do it.” I like to run by playing soccer or basketball a few times a week. But, let's say you’re not a sports guy or that isn’t an option for you, for whatever reason, that’s okay. Try to master the mile in under 7 minutes. Train by mixing run-jog-sprint. (Pro tip: mix in hill endurance sessions, if possible, by running up and down hills or inclines 10x). I’m not saying running is easy, it’s not. Running can be painful at first, but the day will come when your body begins to adjust - usually around the 3 week mark - and you’ll begin to see the positive results. Maybe you’ll note you’re sleeping better or you don’t get as tired throughout the day as you used to or you’re less stressed or anxious, the benefits are endless. This is also usually the time your body is ready to increase the tempo of your runs or intensity of your regimen, says Runner Magazine.

Lastly, let’s cover your equipment, i.e. running shoes. If you’re lucky enough to be at a facility that sells running shoes, that’s your best bet. If not, focus on the lightest gym shoes with the best sole flexibility. Try to only use your running shoes for actual running, to keep them in top condition. Generally, they should run ½ size larger than your normal shoe size to give your feet room to shift without jamming your toes. Wash them after every 10 uses by removing the insoles and spot cleaning the outside with warm water, soap, and an old toothbrush. Let air dry - avoid the dryer as it can ruin your shoes. Replace them every 400 miles or when you notice obvious wear and tear in the soles or start to feel foot or shin pain.

I hope you come away with some good insights and are ready to go run with them (pun intended).
