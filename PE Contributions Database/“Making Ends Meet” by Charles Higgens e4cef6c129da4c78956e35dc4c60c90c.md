**“Making Ends Meet” by Charles Higgens**

Everyone knows that it’s tough making ends meet. Well, almost everyone anyways. I honestly don’t think Donald Trump does. And in prison, it can be just as hard even though our room and board is paid for and we get three meals a day, plus our hygiene is provided for the most part.

No one likes to struggle financially, inside or outside. In here, more often than not, people stumble over their lack of money. Especially if they are trying to avoid costly bad habits. So if they can put those bad habits aside they'll struggle less, but they still like to enjoy a cup of coffee when they choose or something to snack on when the temptation arises. Nevermind if your stomach feels like it’s touching your spine even after your three free meals.

So see, inside you have to make ends meet too, and I’ll admit, it can be annoying and even draining. But, you got to keep at it if you plan on being productive. Sure, there’s a lot of ways to make ends meet inside and much of it is certainly illegal. Is there anything you can do that won’t cause an issue? Yes and no.

Let me explain a little better. No matter what you do, the staff won’t like it. They will misinterpret some rule or regulation against you, even if  it’s not against the law. Why??? Misery loves company. I suggest that you learn their book of policy and procedure to ensure yourself that you won’t get caught off guard. Which by the way, they hate even more. Yes, even if you’re doing good and being productive, haters will always find a way to hate. Why??? It’s what they do.

Some ways are better than others of trying to make ends meet…

- Writing poems, books, articles for sale through publishers
- Draw
- Create cards
- Contests for all the above
- Arts and crafts (like making jewelry/crosses/picture frames)
- Legal assistance (inhouse or outside)
- Washing laundry or cleaning cells (*Although Not Suggested* people will look at you like a “b*tch”)
- Selling commissary to those who don’t have any
- Also allowing someone to order more commissary in your name
- Sewing (especially secret pockets for hiding)
- Gambling: but not recommended for many reasons!
