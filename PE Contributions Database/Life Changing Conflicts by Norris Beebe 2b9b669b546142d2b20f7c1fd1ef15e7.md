**"Life Changing Conflicts" by Norris Beebe**

In a lonely state of disaster, life begins a new sunrise with brilliance. Her shades of colour fades into her light baby blues that perfected the early morning skies. Her breath was fresh after a long evening swish of monsoon rainfall that shared a soft kiss against the skin, as it whispered by. The scent of fresh sugarcane coalescing around a mild mixture of burning hemp and herb pitches the mood of an unusually quiet dawn.

Darkness filled the evening’s twilight from the heavy rainfall. Its spatter ceased to filter out the expansion of constant explosions and rebel fire, even though they were custom to the ongoing endeavor to survive the conflict between their beauties and beasts. A never ending battle…

The sizzling aroma of breakfast cakes of rice popping on blazing lava rocks swept into a different, enchanted livelihood… Political power of democracy brought the My Lai people together to celebrate a victory of life with song and dance. Their troubles vanished for a moment, but just for the moment. Then came a rat-tat-tat.

Returning to reality, life seemed to revolve around constant threats of death and destruction. Controversy lies in the heart of a struggling culture of socialism in difficult despair. Their battle continues in a war on communism despite life’s dispute. War does not regard the people, or its spoils. War loves only the fight, taking all it can with its rage. Death and destruction are all war leaves behind. The countries’ natives are the only victims who pay the ultimate price of war.

Despite their nation’s dramatic fill, life moves forward with or without you, no matter the cause or what it brings. Life always seems to go on.

It was market day. Many of the village’s women and children who could not work in the fields scurried onto the road headed to town for buying, selling and trading the products of their labor. Up ahead was a detour into the wilderness that would hide their presence. They rushed through the trail to avoid the conflict and stay out of sight, but so did their counterparts.

Blades slicing through mid-air fight at low altitudes echoed dangerous concern. They found the main road once again that channeled their path near the rice fields containing wounded neighbors. Fear drew within their souls, stunning their actions as gunfire roared its discharge from the nearby villages. Voices travelling with an unknown tongue raised anxiety and panic through their minds. American troops crept closer, narrowing My Lai tribes men’s attempt to escape.

Losing their advantage and searching for a new escape route, the villagers pushed their way back into the wilderness in fear. Fighting began to break out all around them, realizing they were trapped and cut off in every direction. Their only hope of protection became the trench which ran alongside the village roads.

Silently, they eased their numbers into the clammy merk. The waters chilled them to the bone, stealing a whimpering breath as they slid into a dark, shadowless end. Gruesome speculation consumed them as they shivered in silence. Hugging the the banks, their loved ones and their neighbors, they whispered their prayers, I-love-yous and goodbyes when the gunfire began. Helos flew in low and fast, skimming at a three foot ground troop drop… The gun ships seemed to skim the Earth’s surface for less than a second, just long enough to push its troops out and lift off again on the prowl for their opponent.

The unit just began to work the perimeter when they spotted a crowd of women and children carrying empty baskets. They had just left the hamlet headed to the market. The crowd must not have regarded the moment to be hostile. None of the soldiers were crouching down, hiding, or seeming threatened. They seemed to be just walking around, then the fire began…

Her face became utterly white with fear when she took a peek after the gunfire stalled. What she saw was more than a teenaged, young woman should ever experience. From the muddy wet banks, she glanced into the road to find her neighbors, friends and their families on the road in piles. They had been executed. She covered her face with her hands when tears began to flow down her cheeks. She slid back down in the muck of the trench, knowing they have nowhere to go...caught in the middle.

Panic pumped through their veins when ship gun fire ravaged deep into the latter end of the trench banks. With nowhere to flee as they hug the banks, they awaited their fate.

Many let out screams of horror, though others looked them dead on with despair, hoping to find favor within the shooter. When an American ship landed uncomfortably close to them, four soldiers rushed toward them, armed with fear in their eyes. One soldier reached the edge with his hand out, shouting, “Come with me!”

No one moved, and no one took a new breath until the young, teenaged woman took the soldier’s hand. He pulled her close to his chest, turned toward the ship and began to rush her to the safety of the helo. 12 more followed.

Within seconds, its blades lifted their precious cargo into the sky and away from danger. Minutes later, they returned and rescued another drenched family from counter fire.

He flew many trips, saving as many people as they could. But with every return, more casualties stood motionless. As he was lifting his last victim from an erie, murky end, they all noticed the horrifying circumstances that were left behind…

In the late 1950’s, the U.S. became involved in a conflict between the North and South Vietnamese governments. Rebellion spread against the South which led the U.S. to send American troops to Vietnam. They were to help suppress the rebellion. By 1964, the U.S. was in a full scale war that was initiated against the VietCong rebels of the South and its supporters in the Communist government of the North.

By 1966, two-thirds of the American people supported the Vietnam War. Within four years into the war, protesters formed a great national movement. Draft refusal spread over the U.S. like wildfire.

During the early 70’s, the population supporting the war now opposed their stand. Resistance groups formed quickly and grew strong in a short period while the front lines extended into Cambodia and Laos before a cease fire could be signed.

Finally, in 1975, when the U.S. troops were recalled, Saigon fell which officially ended the war. 58,000 U.S. troops lost their lives. Vietnamese losses were in the millions, but its civilian population had suffered beyond what words could express…

On March 16, 1968, a company of U.S. infantry entered the village of My Lai. Without a single round of hostile enemy fire, the infantry unit searched out, found, attacked and slaughtered over 500 Vietnamese civilian farmers, villagers and common workers and their families, mostly being women and children.

After heavy losses during the evening prior to this tragic event, U.S. troops which were assigned to an aerial scout unit flew over My Lai working their perimeter and received orders from their platoon leader to strike the area. Unfriendlies covered the area just south of the village. Soldiers from the aircraft fired automatic weapons from its funship into the crowds of people and the trenches where the Vietnamese women were hiding with their children in their arms. Only a few survived this gruesome attack. The platoon’s justification for the orders given was that the VietCong staged the area. U.S. lives were lost due to the sniper fire and booby traps in the area.

When the gunships began to fire into the trenches of women holding their children, the waist-high murky sludge became their grave site.

Their casualties were unbelievable. Over 500 women and children were slaughtered in the road and trenches with 120 of more under the age of 5. A sad ending in a war that cost everyone more than it was worth. Is a war really worth the cost of its casualties? I would have to say NO!
