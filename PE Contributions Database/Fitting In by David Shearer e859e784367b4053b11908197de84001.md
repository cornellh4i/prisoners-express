You see all the laughter and fun everyone is engaged in and you want to join in, that's only natural. But in order to really fit in you have to be wanted, cared for, and most of all liked by everyone in the crowd. Well I've found out that I don't fit in, especially in this environment, because of my difference in attitude and outlook on life. See all I want is to be happy and loved and to have a really good job so I can take care of the family I dream of having one day, a wife, three or four kids, dogs, and other pets for my children and a nice house with plenty of room for the children to run and play with their pets. I want most of all for all of us to be happy. There are all different kinds of groups and walks of life out there when in order to fit in there should only be one, and in that group everyone, no matter what race, age, or ethnic background should not hate or disrespect one another but get along and be happy. Show the children that they are loved and teach them the value of life and honesty. To me that is what it all means to "Fit In" but that is my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own.
