One of the most popular ways for prisoners to disrespect each other used to be to tell them, “The cops rescued you!” This was often the response given to inmates who begged and mooched too much. Many inmates are fairly good at vending phony sob stories to the gullible and harvesting tiny amounts of value such as a scrap of food, a few crystals of coffee, a stamp, anything they can get. The more stuff that they mooch off of you, such as essentials like soap and toilet paper, the more they can go hoard for themselves, such as cookies, chips, and cheap noodle soups.

One very memorable mooch-artist named Smith taught hordes of other inmates how to simply go door to door whining for stamps to write his dying granny, then turn those stamps into cigarettes. Within two weeks, dozens of moochers fed their addictions this way. Finally, the Mexicans created a popular way to comment on this “assembly line” begging and to refuse it. They would say, “Stop buying what you want and begin paying for what you need!”

The biggest beggar-inmates tend to be the ones with most mental deficiencies. They have what the TV-experts like to call “Addictive Personalities”. This is a simple way to say that these people are narcissists. Their access to what they want is more important than friendship, morals, or ethics. Some are even psychopaths. Their love of drugs or other vices would normally eventually get them killed or lead them to murder themselves “by accident”; like Elvis, Janis, Jimi, Jim, Whitney, Michael, Prince and many thousands of not-so-famous others. In regard to the limited access to drugs inside prisons, these slow-death camps do indeed prolong the lives of the dopies.

All the cop-cams in prisons help the incurable moochers, beggars, and thieves survive longer than they normally would too. Alert persons may have noticed that the rise of prison “gangs” (In the TV-”News” sense) paralleled the rise of cop-cams in prisons. As the screws poked their cop-cams into every dark hole where somebody could get rat-packed, young, gullible idiots had to be connived into doing the rat pack’s stealing for them. This is the rat pack’s “entrance fee”.

In this state (Oklahoma), the politicians have decided that they have rescued more dopies and thieves than they want to afford for a while. They have passed four new laws that let dopies and thieves recycle in and out of our Oklahoma slow-death camps faster and faster. The “Re-Elect Me!” geniuses call this their new “Git *Smart* On Crime!” initiative. By giving these dopies and thieves yet another cool break, our Oklahoma (OK) politicians encourage these little darlings to rush out and get addicted to even more wonderful drugs to kill and die for. The survivors will perpetrate more, worse crimes, than get recycled back to prison with endless sentences. So, “Smart on Crime” looks a lot like (The exact same as) “Tough on Crime”, except with a smidgen of “Thin the Herd” added.

OK politicians prove that they know what they are really doing by buying another slow-death camp. CCA had to abandon it when, after a twenty year fight, California finally was forced to un-ass fifty thousand of their cursed slaves. That’s pure gold for OK “pols”, whose legal slave industry still turns a humongous taxpayer-paid profit. They are filling it up now. California prisoners, much smarter than Oklahoma inmates, sued their way out. OK inmates sit on their hands while OK prisoncrats shut down *fifteen* pre-release work centers!

OK politicians are smart on crime like a fox to throw their inmates out with no cash, no skills, and no better education than what they were thrown in with. These lucky dopies and thieves will recycle in no time!

One problem is that OK captives are getting too old to work and cost too much in medical bills. OK politicians have a cunning plan for ditching these geriatric captives too! It’s in inadequate health care! These old buzzards are eaten up with heart disease, lung disease and cirrhosis from smoking and alcoholism, so help them die faster by taking away their aspirin and making their only choice that liver-killing toxin Tylenol.

The first part of their plan worked beautifully: all the old inmates sport pus-guts so big that they need wheelbarrows to carry them. Decades of no exercise in tiny cages, and eating mad-cow scrap “meat” and nitrate-poisoned baloneys have given them all diabetes and cancers that they don’t even know they have. They get rich selling the inmates “Tums” and watch them die. Soon the whole herd of slaves will be young, stupid twerps again, eager to work all day for nothing! Yes, we in these slow-death state prison camps are indeed rescued!
