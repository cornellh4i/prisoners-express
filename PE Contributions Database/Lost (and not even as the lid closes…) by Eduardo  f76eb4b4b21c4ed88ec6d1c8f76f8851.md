***Lost (and not even as the lid closes…)* by Eduardo Araiza**

I have never-- I must never. I may not know what I am. I may never know where I am going. I know I shall never get where I should be. I may one day at least be on that not-so-turning road.

But: I have never-ever-ever-ever been lost. Everywhere that I go… I am there. Long ago, before the road was laid placed, I set one foot in front of the other. I just had gotten there, but I recognized the trees. The trees were none and now and then I appreciated sunlight. The light got dim-- I recognized the cold. The sun was high so I learned the word spelled: “s-u-n-b-u-r-n-t.”

The fools say they were the best spellers in class, but I organized the spelling shin-dig. I set the chairs. I scrubbed the floors and sanitized the toilets, typical: skipped actual “spelling.”

The people and the audience and the spellers scared me away from my event so I went fishing with no pole and nothing sharp and hurting.

I simply put a piece of string into the waters and explained the creatures to my situation: I hauled three sharks, a whale, and a musical octopus from a song I once heard, loud.

We were friendly after that, like fellow workers.

I suppose to be lost is to physically lose location, or to personally lose direction. I have hurt too many innocent people to smother more innocents with my actual-size maps.

There is not enough paper in the universe to make and remake every diagram in every hole in my mind, corner of my shaped cranium.

Plus, you and others prefer to walk, drive, crawl, jump, and fly to California with a small idea in a drawing of “where to go.” As for me? Not so, not so:

I make a one-to-one set of diagrams to go anywhere and confuse and enjoy my papier-mache better than the actual place.

It does not matter where I am or what I find. The only things I like are real

are in my head

(and)

in my mind.

One wonderful and quiet day it is yet to stop

and my mind rewind.
