**Accomplishments by Tommy Hightower**

Thank you Gary, and all you blessed students volunteers! I want to begin my true story, with a universal truth all parents share when we talk about life’s accomplishments. Children–good, bad, indifferent–but our children are a parent’s greatest accomplishment.

For me, I have 5 natural children, 2 formally adopted, and thousands informally adopted children, who I have been blessed to meet during my 25-year incarceration to date.

I failed my biological children, who grew up while I have served this term. They failed they children, because they became drug addicts as young teen, 2 adult children has since died, one while passed at on dope, drowned in 18” of water, David was 6’3” 285 lbs, pure outdoors man who swam Lake Tahoe regularly–yet he died while high, in a wading pool–thus leaving 3 young daughters fatherless. They too, now have kids–my great-grandkids–my life’s mission is to go home very soon–God willing, and establishing a family compound in the pacific northwest. With my sister and her 3 generations of offspring. It’s doable.

My accomplishments have been my adopted-prison kids–whom I have done for them what I was denied doing for my own. I give my all to teaching, parenting, and family values to the 1,000+ young men I have been blessed to mentor over 23 years. Most have never returned to prison. Most have become good fathers to their children. Instead of wallowing in self pity over my separation from my offspring. I choose to be a parent to young men who never had a father figure in their lives. Thus, what i ost with my own, was gained back a thousand fold by offering genuine agape love, mentorship, and self esteem building to young men I am proud to call adopted sons.

To all you older inmates–you have a duty to you younger inmate population–be a good father to those who feel the loss of parental love as much as you feel loss of your own kids. When we genuinely offer a helping hand to another it is the greatest reward life has to offer.

For every soul you help break the cycle of prison is a great accomplishment. It denies the system of mass incarceration the next generation of young, lost souls. Let us make prison unnecessary. Its doable if you try, and have faith in yourself, and patience with young men entrusted to you.

Being a parent to the young is the most noble accomplishment anyone can fulfill. It’s a blessing you will cherish forever.

May you all be filled with the blessing of life.
