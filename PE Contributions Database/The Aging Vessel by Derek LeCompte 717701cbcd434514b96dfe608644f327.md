**The Aging Vessel by Derek LeCompte**

I miss the days when I was cut up like Bruce Lee. The days of my youth. I had 1% body fat, I could run for miles and not even feel tired. Everywhere I went I biked, skateboarded, in-line skated or just walked. I was a machine.

Now, that machine is outdated. I laugh because I think of the irony of a fact from The Wizard of Oz. It makes perfect sense to me in my current state. It is concerning the Tin Man and how they made him cry… they used chocolate! In this day, I’m an obsolete machine like the Tin Man and I engorge myself on chocolate! Yes, I know, it’s sad.

I’ll be 40 in November 2019. I’m still athletic, I still play sports, I still work out. I just don’t feel the same. I ache. I’m slower. You’d laugh if you saw my last basketball game. I got a steal and ran down court, my teammate threw me a full court pass and you would’ve thought that I was moving quickly. Nope! It was the slowest fast-break ever!

Now, yes, I don’t look 40, I still don’t necessarily feel 40. But in many ways I’m a unicorn. I’ve never done drugs, I never drank alcohol, I’ve never had any catastrophic injuries. And, my winning percentage is still immaculate. The main part that aggravates people is that I’m white (French- Candian) with long brown hair kept up in a ponytail. People say, “Damn! I just lost to Steven Segal!”

Other than that, my body is a temple. I've never smoked cigarettes. Even with the junk food, I keep a regular diet with many rich fruits and vegetables. Other than the aforementioned chocolate (which isn’t that frequent), I cut out most sugar from my diet. You see, diabetes runs so high in my family that 80% of my aunts and uncles had it by the time they were 30. My grandfathers both had it so bad that one (on my mother’s side) had to have his feet amputated, and my other one (on my father’s side) nearly lost all of his sight. On top of that, cancer seems like a trend. Even living as purely as I can, it seems like everything is still high risk.

Now, one thing I’d like to see a study on is how many people who are in prison get cancer due to contaminants and chemicals, even the food and water of the prison. That’s a risk factor in itself, being in prison! Why aren’t there studies done by the CDC for that? I believe it’s justified. Two guys on my wing (and I’ve only been here for 4 months) went from energetic workout machines and athletes to having every single step being painful. I suspect different cancers. And this is the newest prison in the state of New Jersey. Imagine the ancient ones still in use!

That fact alone makes me constantly analyze my body and it causes me stress and anxiety worrying about my health. But, what more can I do? My options are limited and health services are a farce.

My body seems to be like a war-zone.
