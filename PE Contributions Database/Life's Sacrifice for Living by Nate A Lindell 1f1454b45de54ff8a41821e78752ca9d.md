**“Life’s Sacrifice for Living” By Nate A. Lindell**

The earliest life on earth consisted of non-eukaryotic cells, cells without distinct membranes around their nuclei. Then came eukaryotic cells, cells that had nuclei contained within a membrane (an anti-Marxist process by the way…). That control, restraint, order, imposed on nuclei’s molecular machinery enables cells to evolve and protect increasingly complex genomes that improve cells’ survivability.

The next great leap in life’ evolution occurred when two cells bumped uglies, joined up to help each other kick ass and eat food. Then three, four, more cells clumped together against the world.

Next, those colonies of cells organized/organised themselves so that some cells specialized their functions to help the whole survive. Some cells did the eatin’, some did the digestin’, others did the poopin’. Some cells formed a protective membrane for the entire organism which became known as the skin; other cells fed the skin cells to ensure that the protection continued.

As it is in the micro, so it is in the macro.

Consider how similar a “community” on the human scale is to cells on the microscopic scale. Human communities, too, have evolved. Sure, there are still single-celled organisms; there are also still less evolved (not necessarily worse or better) human societies such as hunting/gathering tribes. But there is also the uber complex multicellular organism known as homo sapiens sapiens, and New York City.

Just as cells that joined together necessarily sacrificed much of their individuality in order to join with other cells and make a cohesive, coordinated, most effective organism, so must people sacrifice their individual whims and characteristics in order to make a strong community. This is true even in supposedly divided communities, such as racially and economically segregated cities- all activities lead to Rome, make Rome Chicago, Dallas, L.A., wherever.

People joined together into a community must sacrifice some of their individuality in order for a community to function, to protect itself from external forces, to exist. Unfortunately, I can’t walk around naked in public, nor can I kill people as that would disturb some people and disrupt social cohesion. Some of those sacrifices I can’t bitch too loud about (you ladies, however, may wish to bitch), yet some unique characteristics of individuals that a community consciously or subconsciously peer presses away strike me as losses worth lamenting (e.g. a Richard Pryor in apartheid South Africa, an Einstein in Amish country, me in prison…).

This macroevolution is, however, unstoppable. Large, cohesive communities like New York City rule the world, pressuring smaller communities to join up or join each other into another macro-organism. The world has only so many resources, as did the primordial soup the first single celled life evolved in; organisms will struggle for those resources, and the most cohesive organism will be the most effective struggler, the fittest, the survivor.

Technology, as you can see by observing people passing you by on the street, facilitates the unification/de-individualization that is essential to the super cohesiveness needed for the microorganism of communities to surpass human individuals as Earth’s dominant life form. People are constantly connected to each other, electronically….

For now, I remain a single celled eukaryote.
