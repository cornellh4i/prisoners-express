***Sun God* by Roshan Sah**

I grew up in a small village in Nepal. Our family owned a big pond in front of our house. Most of the time, my mom would wash clothes at the pond. Sometimes, she would bathe here. At the end of the bath, she would go underwater and come out and raise her hands toward the sun and mumble something. One day, I asked her about this daily ritual of hers. She said she was praying to Sun God for me.

This picture reminds me of my mom. Oh! How much I miss her.
