**“Open Season” by Antwon Housey**

The best time to enjoy the open water is when you’re tripping on a heroic dose of peyote. Before my high kicks in, I sit at the edge of this wooden pier.

It has been about 10 minutes since I’ve eaten the first button. Within these 10 minutes, nothing unusual has happened. Now I bite down on my second button, let the games begin.

I induce my trip by skipping this shiny thin extra slick rock across the lake. This invigorates my perception to the maximum. As soon as I release the rock, it transforms into a yoshi look alike. As it skids across the lake, yoshi turns and asks, “Will you help me save the fish King.” Since this is normal within my current state of mind, I agree with earnest enthusiasm. I’ve been waiting to save the fish king for the last 10 minutes. Yoshi gives me an oxygen tank that’s very new techy. It’s like a bull ring with a tube.

*Splash*.

I jump in the lake as soon as I get my breathing-wear in place correctly. Now the fish king has been overthrown by his estranged lost cousin, The Prince of Eels. Under his dictatorship, the only fish who are not net bondage are the whales and dolphins because they claimed their sovereignty decades ago and formed the United Republica of Blow Holes.

The Prince of Eels army isn’t bold enough to wage war. The king of fish has promised everlasting life to any one who is brave enough to revolt against his cousin.

Now yoshi and myself swim through the lake. I notice that there’s a militia of sea horses equipped with automatic harpoons. Now I’m understanding the severity of the ruleship. The prince of eels shows no mercy upon those we dare to defy his laws and governance. As we get closer to the coral reef structured mansion, the tempo of the water changes. Before the water was roughly body temperature warm. Now it is at least 30 degrees hotter. I’m not sure of it, however, I’m positive that I’m sweating. Not only am I sweating, I am actually feeling my lungs being weighed with a profound amount of pressure. As I try to breathe, I feel the air get sucked out of me.

Then yoshi turns towards me and says, “Clear.” I feel my body spasm. Now there’s a tingling within my entire body. My adrenaline glands are activated, it’s now or never. “Clear.”
