**Debts! By James Bauhaus**

First, let me thank Catherine LeFleur for coming up with so many winners so far (arguments) and for bringing us Katherine Hatten, another Olympic class writer. Also, good job! For Ms. Hicks. I loved that sentiment, “weep at births, celebrate at funerals.” I had not heard that before, and it made a mark on me. And, I don't want to gush, or put off my fellow writers by having too high of an opinion, but in my opinion, Ms. Allenbaugh certainly deserves praise and encouragement for her work. I owe a debt to all of these writers for showing me how to be less critical of others. I **see** how they can write well without being so critical, even though I choose to keep criticizing. I do not; however, owe a debt to a couple of dope dudes who sniffed out my $ because one is smart and the other I feel sorry for. Mutt wears his life story on his scabbed-up head and nastily, busted-out teeth. I give him small items and let him swindle me on barters. His cage mate, Jeff, says he tried to pay the Mexicans his $1,000 dope debt, but his sis or daughter stole it. (I don’t listen too closely to scams.) Meanwhile, one of the “one-stop inmate services” stole $25 from me and never did the internet search I’d contracted for. (I’m trying to find a Jamaican word processor named “Yanique” who advertises on “Fiverr.” She does great work.) So Jeff says his 74 year old mother does great Google, and needs cash. I say, “Find Yanique and I’ll give her a fast $25.”

He said “Sure thing, but send it to me instead.” Days pass. It appears that his poor old mother has had enough of him. He corners me to sell me on his Big Idea about how, using only his brains and my $, he can pay off his dope debt and make me rich just by selling the Mexicans’ trash-dope, (which they get from the kops) for me. “We would be helping each other!” he says.

So, I help my first friend, and his reward to me for doing this to tell his younger dope-buddy, “Jay’s got plenty of money! I Know this because he doesn’t care when I don’t pay him.” I want to help my other friend too, but all I could do with my friend is bow out, because dopies can only learn for themselves that there are better things to do in life, even in prison, than exploit everyone for a few hours of buzz. I feel sorry for both of them, and wish that I could help them more, but this guy is not the fool that they wish I was, and can not be pulled down into the “emergency” that they have created out of their debts.
