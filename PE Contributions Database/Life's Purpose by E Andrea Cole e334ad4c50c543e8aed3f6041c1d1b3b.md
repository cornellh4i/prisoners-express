**“Life’s Purpose” by E. Andrea Cole**

If I told you I knew what your purpose for living was, I’d be a liar. Either that, or the wisest man on Earth. But I’m neither of these. I’m just a man trying not to fall too many times on this road called life.

So far, what I’ve learned is that my purpose in life is to be a joy and blessing to as many people as I can as they cross my path. It’s my job to make someone’s recollection of me a pleasant one.

John 15:17 tells me that the Golden Rule, God’s greatest commandments, is that I love others as He loves me. I’m supposed to treat everyone I meet the way I want to be treated. I would hope that the people I meet want to be a joy and blessing to me, too.

Once I had children, my purpose shifted slightly. You see, my worth is now measured by the joy I bring to my daughter’s lives, as well as their mother’s. Since my currency is now their joy and happiness, I plan to die a very wealthy man.

I don’t know your life’s purpose. But I know mine. I pray that I fulfill it. And I pray you fulfill yours too.
