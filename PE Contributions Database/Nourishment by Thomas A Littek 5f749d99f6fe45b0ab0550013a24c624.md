**Nourishment by Thomas A. Littek**

When I think of nutrition, several questions come to mind: What, exactly, is “nutrition?” And what is it that feeds me and provides me the satisfaction that I crave?

Too often, we tend to believe that food alone nourishes us. But, when I remember that I am more than just a body, I begin to understand that nourishment is not limited to food only. Indeed, the world furnishes a great spectrum of nutritional sources that humans need to maintain good health. Fresh, clean air, sunshine, even quality time spent with loved ones are but a few of many, many sources of nourishment.

I personally crave the sort of nutrition that feeds the spark of life within my soul. Now, since I’m stranded momentarily at the Graybar Motel, I find the best nourishment comes from a good book. Nothing seems to satisfy my wanderlust like a good story. It’s a means of escape that stone walls and steel bars cannot stop. Pillow fluffed, feet propped up, freshly popped popcorn by my side. With everything in place and set to go, I’m off to another time, another place.

Like you, I have my favorite genres, favorite writers, Still, I know our paths have crossed on the pages of some story. Maybe it was in Grisham’s Ford County. Or possibly King’s New England. Perhaps we followed Alice down the rabbit hole, or tagged along with Ann Rule in pursuit of some long-forgotten psycho killer. We’ve met before; we’ll meet again in some story far, far away from the Graybar Motel.
