**“Mountain King” by Forrest King**

When I see this picture(of the mountains) it makes me think of how the mountains are in me. I picture myself sitting sometimes cross-legged, sometimes with my arms behind me and my legs stretched out. Usually cross legged though. I’m usually, well always, right there along the river. Watching the water flow, wondering where these stones came from. How long have they been there? How many are there? Tortuga is my black wolf and he sits beside me. Always. On my right. Now Tortuga wasn’t always there and when I saw him the 1st time I found it extremely peculiar. He’ll just sit there, sometimes not saying anything at all. He’ll just sit there, sometimes not saying anything at all. He’ll just stare straight ahead. I’m not gonna lie, he used to scare me. But not anymore. He’s solid black with like these orange eyes. He’s actually become quite the companion. Ever still. Ever patient. Ancient wisdom. One day, I couldn’t help but ask him what he was lookin at. He said something short and extremely wise like he usually does. There was snow all over but you could still see the river. And so I looked and strained my eyes and I saw them. The herd of deer had been so patiently and persistently watching. They develop patterns ya know. And hunters like Tortuga must be very keen and still when hunting such an elusive meal. He’s very protective, Tortuga is, and I still wonder where the hell he came from. But when he’s around I can lower my guard because I know he’s got my back. I almost feel like a little boy with his dog.

Now on the left sits a small foot. He’s a young Indian warrior. He’s been gone for a while but I think he’s off doing something with his people. He’s young, maybe 20, and has a long braided ponytail which he is very proud of. He seeks to be a man. He sits to my left. He’s from the mountains and enjoys our sitting and relaxing by the river. We really like the spring. I’ll run my hands through the grass and stretch out, or maybe prop up on my elbow. One day, Smallfoot asked me about my world and I found it quite difficult to explain to a young warrior Indian life in the United States. I’ve never really had to articulate those things to someone who knows nothing of my land. So I explained the people and the habits of my people. The skyscrapers, and buildings, and cars. Smallfoot is in many ways like a child and is very curious. His heart is pure and I see his motives. He’s really a quite noble kid. However, if he ever heard me call him a kid he’d probably want to kick my ass. Good company nonetheless. Funny thing is, I’m not sure where the hell he came from either. Strange huh?

So me and my two buddies make up quite the trio. Most days, honestly, we just sit there and stare out across the river. Sometimes I wonder if Heaven is anything like this. I sure do hope so, with all the birds and squirrels, the leaves. Even the trees are conscious of us. Or so it seems. It’s crazy how I’m in such great company and we hardly ever talk. We don’t even walk. Don’t need to. Not here. Not in this place.

Tortuga’s really like the leader. He’s kind of rough around the edges though. He’s always serious and is sometimes quite the grouch. But, (sigh), you get used to him and his company’s always appreciated. We enjoy our times in the mountains by the river. In those times, man, life is good…

When I was at my old unit, a man told me to “let my problem float down the river.” So I tried it. And after a few years, this is where I’m at, this story. Just another part of my daily meditation practice.
