***Eyes to See, Ears to Hear, Heart to Feel* by Robert Clayton**

Within any city limits, in any given city in the world. Women will attend a service, looking for the divine within at least one male. While man attends in search of common ground. For this reason, he should be allowed to attend. She should not. In fact, the female species should only be allowed on the grounds.

Men read Holy Scriptures looking for purpose. Women read also, but they do so searching for a way-of-life. That is why you should allow her to study, but not him. Because the male species should be allowed to carry the book. Never to open.

Males prescribe purpose. For this reason, we seek to mark territory with our wine, as a signpost of protectiveness. Because we have learned from nature that urination is a survival mechanism. A gift to the animal kingdom. To both chase away spirits, and the self-proclaimed righteous.

Females manifest our way-of-life. Just as only within the womb may fire be born within water. Within pregnancies many secrets, you see, ovaries are the blessing ensuing the renewal of spiritual essences. A gift from heaven by way of: fetus swallowing an earthly fire, water, air mixture, leaving the womb and having a phantom umbilical cord.

Exceptions to life are those upon reaching our world. Some men are born into life, with ears to hear, no eyes to see. Just as females may come forth with eyes to see, not ears to hear. But few will be born with hearts to feel. Do you know of any? Allow me to help you find out. Thou shalt know them by their works.

She: will have a terrible disease in childhood, many outside her race. For the reasoning she holds deep within is that she couldn’t be the cause of her own suffering. He: shall be very understanding and receptive to the needs of another, open with true feelings, and literally adore cooking for family with kids. Finally, she will get her orgasm by looking at his nakedness stand before her. As he grants himself true pleasure, through: sweet scents, soft tones, and softly spoken syllables. Not in religious service though. That’s where you will find the heart that feels. They’ll be speaking in parables.
