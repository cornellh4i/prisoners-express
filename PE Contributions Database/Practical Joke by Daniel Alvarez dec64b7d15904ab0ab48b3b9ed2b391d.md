**"Practical Joke" by Daniel Alvarez**

Practical jokes can easily go wrong. Make sure that how you touch the person you play a joke on cannot be construed as a physical act. To call someone on the phone and play ghostface from “Scream” the movie is difficult, and I don’t recommend it. Because if you say “I’m gonna stab you,” or “I’m going to kill you,” it’s a federal offense. I recommend you call a friend, change your voice, and ask if they would like to be a nude model for an art class. When they say “no,” just offer them money. Once they say “yes,” tell them where to meet you, preferably by campus. If you want to be nice, talk to them a little more, change your voice back to normal, and say, “What’s up with you wanting to pose naked?”

Another good phone prank is to call someone and pretend you’re trying to sell something, then start talking. Tell them you like them and keep them on the phone. It’s actually a good way to get to know someone, except for the part where you continue trying to sell them cable service, new phone company, or magazine subscriptions.

Another one: when you’re with a bunch of your friends, call someone you all know and tell them you’re all gay. The game is to see how long you can keep them on the line, while the whole time you hit on them and tell them you want to meet with them. If you manage to do both simultaneously for over 12 minutes, your friend is probably gay.

As you can see, I recommend phone pranks because as long as you don’t make any violent threats, you’re in the clear. It’s also very hard for phone pranks to go awry. A final phone prank is to start your answering machine with “hello” wait three seconds and say, “Where are you?” Five seconds after that, say “Hey I’m not here so leave a message.”
