BELIEVE IT OR NOT

Word Theme by Jack Simpson

The public will believe a good lie, than the real truth. Prison has it’s tales of how we live, trust, respect, and believe our fellow inmates. The truth to the matter is no-one will believe what we say unless they are here and see it for themselves.

Here is one thing that I will not couch up for the sake of the system. There is a meat product that they call “Poultry.” The hot is labeled as such. Most of the fellows call it mystery meat. It doesn’t look or feel like any poultry I have been around.

Last week we were served this product at lunch. No-one wanted to eat it. I feel really bad when food is wasted. I never had poultry gravy on the street when I was young. I’m a stickler when it comes to food being called something it isn’t. Since we have so many people in this country and others starving and will eat it, I took the liberty to remove the gravy and rice fro the meat.

There are a lot of cats here. I’m not talking about ten. I’m talking dozen’s. They fend for themselves and do a pretty good job at it. There is one cat that is shy and will poke it’s head out of the scrape metal when called.

I call this cat Bob since his/her tail is twisted and short. Between the milk, chicken, hot dog wieners and other meat, this cat has learned my voice. Once it is called, it comes to the fence. It will not allow me to pet it. Must have trust issues also.

Once the poultry meat was placed on a dish, I backed away to see if the cat would eat it. To my surprise the cat sniffed the meat and backed away. I walked away to return latter to find the meat still there and not touched. The cat came back to take a second sniff. Don’t know for sure if it didn’t smell good o it detected Something in the meat.

Cats are real finicky eaters. I had my share of cats when I was young. Unless they are raised on special food, when I see a cat back away from food that we are served, then my flag goes up. I have ate it before, it took a lot of salt and pepper to cover up the taste.

Believe it or not most people treat their pets better than their own kids. I still have a choice to eat this meat or not. I elect not to, since process meat does more damage to our body than fresh meat. Lets just say the meat here wil have to be as it is called “mystery meat.”
