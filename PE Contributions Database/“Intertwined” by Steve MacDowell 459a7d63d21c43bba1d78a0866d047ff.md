**“Intertwined” by Steve MacDowell**

****Intertwined, fused intimately, a mysterious bond. A passion of fire, an avalanching destiny composed of erotic and ethereal eros! Two hearts reaching and coercing each other’s desires to be touched. Felt with emotion, embraced by vivid arousal, embarking upon a course to make love, and yet never touch the anatomy of her desired wantonness. The muliebrity of her existence is engulfed in a performance of tantra and hypnotized by the volition to make love, and yet ceases to be encapsulated by the act. The glistening sheen, a sheer arousal of tasting her lips, the fragrance of her flesh. Sensuality dripping from my thoughts: the beauty appears as never before, sitting beside you and looking into the window of thy soul as it interprets the value of the heart within the strategic veracity, such scientia of love. My existence misses the synergism of this moment as it’s allured by your facet of effluent aura. Intertwined by strands of existence through interpretations of its physics. My wisdom, knowledge, and understanding are posed in a pinnacle of Nirvana. We share and live among the extemporaneous creatures, and the physics which ignites passion intertwines you and me inexplicably.
