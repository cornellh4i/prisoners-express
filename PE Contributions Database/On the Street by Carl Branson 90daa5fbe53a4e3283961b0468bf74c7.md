**On the Street by Carl Branson**

“Making ends meet” typically conveys thoughts of the financial/economic realities of keeping body and soul together; food, shelter, and clothing being primary considerations. Having led a very blessed life, I have never had to worry about these essentials and much more being available constantly. As such, I can only relate on the intellectual level with those who have had serious problems with survival necessities.

Recently a young fellow prisoner shared the horrors he experienced beginning in his last semester of high school.

The catalyst for this man’s downfall was rebellion by a younger sister against parental authority regarding dating habits. Sis trumped up a complaint against mom to CPS in hopes of getting her own way. Under the guise of “investigating” the complaint, government workers constantly disrupted his school day. This harassment compelled him to (1) drop out of school and (2) accept the offer of an older, out-of-state sister to move in with her. The only stipulation was that he be a good role model for his niece. Unfortunately, some new “friends” thought that it would be hilarious to supply him with tainted marijuana, destroying his role model status.

Turned out with his few possessions in a rucksack, he took to the streets. Panhandling, “under the table” landscaping jobs, and other odd jobs kept him fed. Occasionally an acquaintance would provide a couch or floor as a place to sleep with pavement behind dumpsters being an all too common place.

After a few months an uncle and friend took him in. It wasn’t long before he was sexually assaulted by these benefactors to further their internet porn business. It was back to the relative safety of the street.

His recounting of events was far more detailed (and disheartening) than this arms-length summary. What I found strange, but extremely gratifying is his upbeat, positive attitude. Rather than dwell on the past, he takes great pride in having used the prison’s education department to complete his high school diploma requirements. What’s more, he is planning to attend college within months of his pending release to improve his future.
