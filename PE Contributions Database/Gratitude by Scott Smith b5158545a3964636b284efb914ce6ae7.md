**Gratitude by Scott Smith**

The degree to which a person can be grateful is reflective of and relative to the complexity and depth of that person. A person who is wise and experienced is capable of much gratitude. This type of person has been thoroughly tested in many of life’s trials, therefore, has the ability to recognize and appreciate what has been done for them. They definitely understand sacrifice and value. Almost every expenditure appropriated to such an individual is worthwhile, because they are conscious of its cost. It is good to give and assist these people.

Gratitude is also indicative of potential, and to what extent a person will succeed. It can be compared to personal competence because a person who can contemplate and grasp the totality of what has been done for them has shown that they are responsible and prepared for more. A child born into wealth is unlikely to comprehend the value of a dollar and is likely to squander is wastefully. This type of person is usually unprepared to be trusted with much. A person who has shown diligence and progressed through spectrums knows and understands responsibility wholly. They are grateful people who are ready to be endowed with much because they have already earned much and have shown prudence with what they have earned. This is how it is with a person of gratitude: they have shown keen awareness and appreciation in regards to what they have been given or what they have earned, and are ready for more. People who are grateful are always rich, sometimes in the material sense and invariably in the spiritual sense.

Like most things, gratitude appears in different levels and forms. Rarely is gratitude a natural capability, rather, it evolves and cultivates with the individual and the experiences that he or she endeavors. Gratitude is able to manifest into its most elaborate form within a person who has sojourned much tragedy and controversy. Although these instances are almost always traumatic, they are often offset with a grateful perspective that is only achievable through extreme optimism. It sometimes takes rough circumstances to perceive the diversity of the skills and assets you obtain. This is about being aware of what you do have, not dwelling or lingering on your sufferings and defeats. Truthfully, a superior form of gratitude develops from this.

A grateful person is a warrior. The scars we wear are evidence of life itself and, therefore, they are the essence of victory. These reminders are at times physically perceptible, and at others, they are shrouded and internalized. Whether they speak of external combat or emotional contention does not matter, what is of importance is the wisdom and insight that is gathered from them. The only type of person who can school a hardened individual is one who has earned multiple marks and badges in life’s tumult. Because of this, the weathered friend does fine.

Gratitude can be the best teacher. If you concede, it will guide and shape your mind, allowing you to accurately see the good in all things. With practice, your mind will start to recognize this trend of thought, validate it as a superlative, and finally, it will adopt this positive method and establish it as modus operandi, the norm. This is the lucrative base operative system for the mind---there you have the ability to consider all things realistically and rationally. You no longer view yourself as the victim of circumstance, contrarily; you become empowered by the truth and the knowledge of the things you can control. What you control are your actions and your perspective, those qualities alone are of the highest virtue and are worthy of praise.
