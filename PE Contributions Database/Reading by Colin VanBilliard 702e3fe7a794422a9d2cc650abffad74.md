**"Reading" by Colin VanBilliard**

When I got convicted I couldn’t read my court papers. I only had gotten to third grade so how was I competent to stand trial for robbery if I couldn’t read?

I started getting my stuff and the Old Timer in Elmire told me to get a dictionary-thesaurus. Every word you asked me to spell, so I worked in the gym and got put down for library. I stole my first hardcover thesaurus, put it in my bag and brought it back to my cell.

I asked the Old Timer to show me how to use the book. As he showed me my level of reading climbed little by little. In 2009 my friend that writes gave me a pen and book for writers. I learned to write poems and I wrote four movie songs with this book. It teaches me to read but I never really learned to read but I love to read about writing. When I read my name in the Prisoner Express for the first time I stood on my bed and made a speech. I was so happy that I almost cried. Just to make the magazine of Prisoner Express is an honor as it’s handled by college people. I’m still working on my reading and I use it with my poems. I love words!
