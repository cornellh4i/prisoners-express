**"Road Trips" by Catherine LaFleur**

I used to look forward to road trips. My parents took summer vacations every year in the Winnebago. It made road trips very luxurious. Then my parents got stationed overseas and the Winnebago was sold. In Europe, we traveled by train and a small Citroen. This began my parent’s love affair with economy cars. Upon returning to the United States, my father purchased a Chevette.

The car was a cream beige color with bucket seats, a small bench seat, and a cargo space with a hatchback. It was a great car for town and short jaunts. I loved going to theme parks as a child. Rollercoasters and gravity rides were my favorites. However, long trips in the Chevette made me violently sick. Somehow that car cursed me. This changed all theme park experiences, turning my favorites into “Six Blaghs Over Georgia,” “Barf in the Busches Gardens,” and “Let’s NotBerry Farms.” I can’t explain why that car made me so sick. Afterward, I was never able to travel without heavy medication and an ample supply of sick bags.

As I got older, my family took to the next frontier, cruise ships. Every year my parents would book a family vacation. Shipboard life was infinitely worse than the Chevette. At least with a car, you can pull over and the world stops spinning. You can’t get off a boat at sea, but by then I had discovered the steadying effects of alcohol. A partial transcript of the proceedings ten minutes after boarding any cruise ship:

Me: Give me something with a low overall volume and high alcohol content.

Bartender: *slides some concoction with vodka and lime*

Me: *Gulping*. Thanks, I hate vodka, but any port in a storm.

Bartender: *Smiles*

Me: I would like another low-volume, high alcohol content drink.

I would drink through several pink drinks, a few green drinks, some black substance, and finish up with vodka, Kahlua and tonic over layers of slivered ice. I would get wasted and collapse in my cabin until the next morning and spend each day pleasantly numbed from a series of tropical rum drinks that take the edge off of my clanging inner ear. No one minded much because I am a happy drunk. Really, I tried everything, but nothing the doctors prescribed or the acupuncturist did help me with nausea.

Being incarcerated, I have extremely limited opportunities to ride in vehicles. I only go where my feet carry me. I am disgustingly healthy. However last year, I developed a stone in my salivary gland. It swelled until I looked as if an alien were trying to hatch from my jaw. It was extremely painful. Surgery was the only option, which would require a “road trip” to the hospital. I am a high custody inmate so taking me out of the prison is an event for the officers and an ordeal for me. I have to be black-boxed on the wrists, chained at the waist and hobbled. Sigh... all quite unnecessary if you ask me.

I had not been on a medical trip for a very long time. Somehow the sheet detailing my motion sickness problem was missing from the file. Therefore, I did not get any medication and the officers would not give me a little bag. You cannot refuse a medical trip for any reason. To do so would be to refuse the treatment, and in my case the surgery. Did I mention the pain? I had been suffering for months. Additionally, because the van with seats facing forward was in for repairs, I had to be driven in the “dog cart.” The dog-cart is a van with no windows and is essentially a steel box with metal benches along the sides. Fabulous. I would be riding sideways in a box with no windows.

I remarked to Sergeant as I got on the van that I suffered from motion sickness and that she might want to get me a trash bag. Even though she had known me for a long time, the request was ignored. Sadly for everyone, there was another inmate in the van with me.

Sergeant drove like she was in a demolition derby. This is probably the way everyone drives in Miami and what followed was inevitable. There was no air conditioning and the heat was oppressive. All I can say is three-quarters of the way into the trip, Mount Vesuvius erupted and covered everything. There was no way I could be taken out of the van in that condition and it continued, violently, all the way back to the prison.

The van pulled in between the two gates and the officers leaped out of the van immediately. Inmate medical orderlies dressed in paper suits and armed with hoses and scrub brooms were standing by. Of course, I let the other inmate go out first, she was the real victim. Then I sort of rolled out of the van and lay on the burning asphalt while I was hosed off with the sprayer. I couldn’t get up for twenty minutes.

A month eventually passed and I still needed surgery. The prison doctor scheduled me for another appointment. This time, I was sequestered in the infirmary the night before. I was dosed with Dramamine and in the morning received two more mystery injections. Within the hour, all was pleasant in the world and everything took on a beautiful, hazy glow. The sergeant showed up with all of my steel accouterments and wound them around me. I was louche and relaxed, sort of like being on a cruise ship. I practically had to be poured in a pitcher and carried out to the back gate. This time I got chained in the front cage with windows.

The maxillofacial surgeon was tall and handsome. How lucky I was to get a sexy and young instead of bitter and curmudgeonly surgeon. As he prepared for the surgery, he explained I would receive another injection of...something wonderful which was fine by me. I didn’t even flinch or have any desire to bite him when he probed painfully around my mouth. He cut under my tongue, pulled out something disgusting and dropped it in a specimen cup. As he was cauterizing the underside of my tongue, wisps of smoke drifted out and I stared into his dreamy brown eyes and thought...well, I fell asleep.

The sergeant woke me and asked if I was ready to go back. I slurred, “home James,” and I walked out tilting slightly to the side with an officer propping me up on the right. The trip back was uneventful, but of course, I sang a few bars of “Show Me the Way to Go Home” before sleeping through the rest of the trip back to prison. I didn’t even get to enjoy looking out the window. So much for my latest road trip. I don’t think they are going to be in a hurry to take me anywhere for a long time, but Sergeant sings pretty good harmony.
