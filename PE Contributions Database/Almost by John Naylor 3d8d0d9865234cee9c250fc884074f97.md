**Almost by John Naylor**

This is the second article I’ve written on “almost.” The first was “almost” published by “The Sun.” I know writers face rejection. Though when I asked if they’d even received it, The Sun never replied. To this day for all I know it was wrongfully, illegally, confiscated or destroyed by staff, my narrative demonized, distorted in an action to define me or slander me to others in some way.

Wouldn’t it be more successful to mislead others concerning my narrative if it was printed? It was about a girl I met through connecting flights from Chicago to Dallas to Abilene, Texas. I was off to visit my brother at Abilene Christian University. The girl’s name was Ronnie. We were both in high school. Her guardians were supportive of her travels. To this day I know if I’d pursued her contact information instead of greeting my brother I would’ve had a lot of calls to Sweetwater, Texas. She was such a kind girl. She wanted to dedicate her life to working with foster homes. That would’ve been rewarding work. To this day I hope she’s well. I believe we both missed out on a great friendship at the very least. I wish none of you to hesitate as I regretfully did that day.
