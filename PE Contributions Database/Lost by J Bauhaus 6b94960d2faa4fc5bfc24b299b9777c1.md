Lost is what Jimmie Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, looked like when he delivered his annual terror scare today. “North Korea has a missile!” he shrieks. “They got a bomb. Run for your lives!” His real message was, “This is our excuse to pick America’s pockets for a few more billions of dollars to bloat up the Pentagon some more and make you buy us an anti-ballistic missile system to protect us politicians and bureaucrats. We’ve terrified ourselves by making so many enemies!”

Another reason for the terror scare is to distract thinking men from reasoning: “Korea isn’t going to shoot a bomb at us because our politicians have at least 20,000 bombs to shoot at Korea. No rich, privileged leader wants to commit suicide or have his tax-herd and country destroyed.”

So they all got together to punish Korea with unspecified, nebulous “sanctions.” Amusingly, it was revealed that South Korea has a factory over the border where it takes advantage of almost free North Korean labor by paying poverty wages for cheap manufactured goods that can sell at a fantastic profit. The amusing part occurs when they describe this flagrant exploitation as a humanitarian effort.

Lost is what Hillary Clinton feels when she learns that many young women and men are voting for old man Sanders. She thought all she had to do was smile and wait to be crowned.

Lost is the feeling Obama has at the outrage that the Supreme Court pulled on him. They decided to butt in, unasked, and stop the EPA from making coal-fired power plants that put pollution-scavengers on their chimney pipes. Looks like Scalia, Thomas, Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy have all the clean air that they need, and the rest of us can take a flying bite out of a rolling donut.

To avoid this type of nonsense, we need to find replacements who are altruists, and we can find them by giving them personality and ethics test to uncover the crazies and crooks. Without applying quality controls to our privileged leaders, we are the ones who are lost.
