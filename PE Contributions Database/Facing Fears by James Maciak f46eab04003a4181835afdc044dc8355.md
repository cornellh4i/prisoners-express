****Fear is an emotion felt in the presence of danger or threats. Many people live their lives in fear. These people can be considered cowards, spineless, or even straight bitches. Many groups use fear and scare tactics to their advantage. Also many people face their fears head on.

Fear is a mental emotion that becomes physical. It can be very bad for your health. It causes anxiety, stress, and nervousness. Stress causes all kinds of health problems and ages you far beyond your age.

Many people live in fear of so many things in their lives. Some are even afraid to come out of their home. Many are brainwashed by television, newspapers, and schools. They are being held hostage by their own minds.

Many governments and groups use fear to control their citizens. One example is the Filipino President, Duterte. He has had over two thousand drug dealers and users killed since he has become president. This is very extreme in today’s standards. Just like ISIS and other extremists, terrorism and death is used to put people in fear worldwide.

Some people face their fears head on to try to overcome them. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. Do you want to live in fear and be a coward? Will you let the media brainwash you into constant fear and stress? Will you let terrorist groups dictate where you go or what you believe?

My advice to you is to not let fear control you. Rather you control fear and use it to your advantage. It’s all mental to begin with. Train your mind to transform your fear to another emotion that works in your advantage. Don’t let fear hold you back in life.
