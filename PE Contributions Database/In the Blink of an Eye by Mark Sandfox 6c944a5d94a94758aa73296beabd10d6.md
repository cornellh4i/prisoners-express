**“In the Blink of an Eye” by Mark P. Sandfox**

In the blink of an eye

An action is etched in time

A choice to change many alive

A mistake hung deep dark in a closet

A skeleton that won’t decay

In the blink of an eye

A child is born wailing with life

A smile is formed, such a wonderful life

A word is spoken, a step is taken

A shoe is tied, a school bus ride

In the blink of an eye

A trigger is pulled, life its toll

A widow weeps, love is lost

A child cries, Papa, want Papa

A cell door slams, Mama oh Mama

In the blink of an eye

A love is sparked, two hearts as one

A hand joins hand, as two they are strong

A ring, a veil, bring on the wedding bells

A stitch in time forever to be one

In the blink of an eye

A knee is skinned, tears they fall

A frantic cry, arms open wide

A swoop of love, bandaged and clean

A kiss upon knee, a smile is born

In the blink of an eye

A screech of tires, busting glass

A world goes dark, fading fast

A head is cradled, tears they fall

A warm embrace for just a little while

In the blink of an eye

A blink before think can often sink

A sink can wash a blink if we think

A thought! Think of a blink as a sink

A final blink? Nothing more than a blink
