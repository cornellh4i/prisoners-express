***Expressionless* by Torrance Bailey**

“Divorce!” I gasp for breath as I awaken out of my sleep. Was I dreaming or is it the continuous sounds of my parents as they argue? They’ve been arguing more regularly within these past few years. I regain my composure, and my breathing’s back to normal. My senses have come to a steady halt. However, my brain is still foggy.

“Peter, I want a divorce! I can’t take this anymore! You’re always out doing God knows what and--” Sarah was cut off by Peter’s slightly barton and frustrated voice. “Why now? Why ever? Especially with Emily in her room who’s probably asleep! Every night we gotta go through this same shhh” Peter let his words trail off. “Mess!” His word trailed off to keep from cursing. “I’ve told you time and time again that there’s nobody else. Now must we have this conversation right now with Emily in the other room!? Maybe you’re--” Peter gave Sarah a cold stare. He turned off with a scuff before words slip through as mumbles. “Probably the one.” He really didn’t mean to say it or for the most part, for it to be heard, especially not now.

“Oh” Sarah let out one word with the sound of shock that he would say such a thing. Sarah learned in close to Peter trying to bring her words to whisper. “I probably am the one that’s been stepping out, getting my groove on with someone else better!” [Smack] Peter really didn’t mean to smack her, he never has. Sarah, too, didn’t mean to slap him back since she never has, but she was really trying to get Peter’s attention for more affection and love. “I want a divorce!” Her words seemingly at a whisper as it cracked with hurt. However, it landed on the my ears very clearly.

“Did my ears just hear that?” I whispered through broken exhaled air. My senses are no longer foggy. A lump swelled up in my throat. I heard the rain coming down, vividly splashing against the windowpane.

I jumped out of bed and quickly slid into a pair of jeans and a raincoat fleece. I grabbed the umbrella and shot out the door, not really caring if my parents would even say anything or come after me.

In a shocked expressionless daze, my mind came back to reality as the rain drops splashed on top of the umbrella and slittered their way downward, dripping off the side falling to the earth.

It’s been 5 years ago, and every so often, my mind drifts back to that traumatic experience of my parents’ melee and the slappings they’d given each other. How can my face not be expressionless?
