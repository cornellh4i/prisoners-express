**“If He Only Had a Heart” by Nate A. Lindell**

****Lawrence had no heart.

That’s what the judge said when he sentenced Lawrence to over 400 years in prison for a senseless murder that shocked their small town. The murder didn’t make sense, even to Lawrence, at the time. But with too much time, Lawrence began to ponder and to study subjects he didn’t even know of when he was 20 years of age: developmental psychology, theories about the nature of personality, classic literature, etc. It now made some sense to him how he came to do what he’d done.

*But what’s done cannot be undone*, he thought, many, many times, paraphrasing Shakespeare.

As far as Lawrence knew, he didn’t have a heart, not when he committed his crime. He had no need for one--a heart in the metaphorical sense of what enabled someone to love.

Doing time didn’t hurt. It was an empty routine, spent mostly in a cramped cell. Because he didn’t get in trouble and stayed to himself, he had a cell to himself. As he sat in his cell, considering these new ideas, after 22 years in prison, he struggled to restrain the new, myriad emotions that washed over him like 400 volt waves of electricity. His skin roiled from the intensity of anxiety, fear, desperation… anger, which was blowing through the bones like a nuclear blast.

*Is this what love is?* He wondered, choking back a sob that struggled to tear its way out of his throat like one of Sigourney Weaver’s parasitic aliens. Thick tears oozed from his eyes which he didn’t bother to wipe away.

How the fuck did this happen? He wondered, knowing full well that he was never getting out of prison. He never considered seeking a “real” relationship with a woman. When he started writing to a woman who wrote him in response to a penpal ad, it was merely a way to pass time and maybe get some sexy letters.

He had been writing the woman for three years and bits at a time, like a flower opening, he thought, she’d opened herself up to him, telling him things she didn’t even tell the boyfriend she met at church. For example, she didn’t respect her boyfriend for his unmasculine behavior. Lawrence, not feeling anything, shared things about himself too, such as why he hated pedophiles. He told things he’s never told anyone, yet he felt safe telling her.

It was three days after Thanksgiving as he sat on his bunk trying to get a handle on his emotions. Earlier, he got a letter from her that told him that her lame boyfriend proposed and that she’d accepted, and so she couldn’t write him anymore.

*She doesn’t even respect him!* He thought in a fury. *Why do I care?!* He tried to convince himself and think coolly. But he knew he cared, and he realized why.

It’s a good thing I don’t have a cellie, he thought, imagining multiple cruel ways to dismember him. Anger quelled the pain, he realized, and the thought peeped up that maybe he’d used anger to dull such pain before, before he could even remember, which made him more sad.

*Fuck!* He thought. He’d never suffered from the regrets he had about the crimes he committed. But he was suffering now! He found out that the judge was wrong.
