**Making Ends Meet by Master Builder**

Being born African in America, our people have never been a stranger to poverty, low income housing, welfare, and depending on the government for assistance to provide for our families. Since slavery our poeple have always had to make a way to survive the conditions white people create to keep their control over our lives. Making ends meet has become included in our DNA and genetics. What has been able to keep us alive for so long when the odds have always been against us from the start.

The hardest thing is for a parent to do is look at our children and they are hungry. Something inside of us will make us do anything to get food for our children to eat. So many black families all over the world suffer this same problem, a curse that plagues our people globally. Their greed has held our people hostage and living in poverty in the most deplorable and inhumane living conditions.

We slave night and day working to make them wealthy just to for us to make barely enough to buy food, clothes and provide shelter for our families. Surviving has become our way of life. A mother will sell her body or all herself to be exploited sexually if that is her only means to get money to feed and take care of her children. African men in America populate the prisons in America become of the system that was designed by white men for us to fail. But we take the risks on the block all day and night flippin’ crack like pancakes, knocking the harsh consequences if we got caught. But the love we have for our African queens and children we can not just let them suffer from hunger or lack of shelter. So we don’t fear the consequences. The risks for them will always be worth it everytime we come through the apartment door with bags full of food for our families. It will always feel good to have enough money to feed our families, to buy them clothes and pay the bills. How could an African man feel like a real man any other way?

If you can’t relate to this truth you will never be able to understand what it feels like to be broke, hungry, and homeless living in American being born Black. Most of us were poor growing up living in the ghettos and slums built for us to live on. Before we ever had money, nice cars, the bling-bling and the mansions next door to the same people that designed the ghettos. For our people and the conditions to keep us there. We were poor at one point in life.

Some Africans born in America seem to forget once they get rich. They forget where they came from and who they left behind on their way up the bracket crashing over the backs of others to make it out. The cost of life has gone up now that you have moved to a more expensive neighborhood and are paying for a bigger house, a more expensive life, more expensive jewelry, and you have the expensive foods you see the rich white people buy. You can never match their money and how they live horribly, so they are still eating off of money made back in slavery and the moeny we work so hard for to give right back to them. It’s like watching a hamster running in place inside the wheel. We are not really going anywhere, just as far as they want us to go, We will always just be making ends meet when they control the economic system we live under.

It was a message and a lesson to be learned at the end of the movie *The Wizard of Oz.* When the curtain is opened what we will find is an old, wrinkled, weak, white man hiding behind it controlling a machine he designed to trick us and keep us in fear of his powers. When in reality he is powerless and a coward. We give him control over our lives through his deceit and trickery. Now we know the truth, why do we continue living our lives just making ends meet?
