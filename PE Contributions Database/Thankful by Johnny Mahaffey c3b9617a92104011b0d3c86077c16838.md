**“Thankful” by Johnny Mahaffey**

I’m not really the kind of person that gives thanks to an outside source for actions of the individual--I’d much rather give credit where credit is due--and be respectful to those “doing the right thing.”

I agree with Gary that we should not “let the politicians fool [us] by dividing [us] into groups that dislike and distrust others” (PEN 17, p.30). Which seems to be their status quo: to divide and conquer. As cliche as it sounds; but, then again, it is a cliche title: politician. The raison d’être of most office holders. “Trustees of the people,” Grover Cleveland called them--but to be more accurate, I’d prefer Gabriel Chevallier’s branding: “A dealer in promises.”

Very seldom do we encounter a TRUE leader. Which, by my own definition, is an unbiased and qualified individual, who simply does what is right without regard to religious and/or political or societal class or affiliation(s).

Those are the people I am thankful for--not the showboats that want a “title,” and certainly no self-promoter drowning in self-worship who wishes to make water out of everyone else. One good thing about our current White House circumstance is that President Trump has thrown the system into such disarray that our government can now face TRUE change. It took corruption to expose corruption. Now, the country can reassess what “government” is and what we expect of it and the people WE elect to operate it. For that, I am thankful.

Every level of government--from country, to state, to Capitol Hill and all of its satellite locales--was in complete stagnation! The recession of the 2000s shook the foundations upon which all levels of office stood, and as a result, questions and audits ensued, knocking a lot of rotten apples and dead limbs out of governmental trees nationwide...For that, I am thankful. It means that the suffering through which we went was not in vain, because not all, but many of those responsible for the financial collapse were forced out of office. Now, new computer algorithms keep better tabs on what’s going on. No more “hidden books.” The whole political game has changed.

The problem, currently, is that some still try to hold onto days of the past, and they learn, one by one, that the Internet (as a medium for the people’s voice) keeps them on a virtual leash, as every act they perform, good or bad, gets judged by the web-surfing voters at large.

I’m thankful for this new information age that makes political corruption and law enforcement manipulations, biases, and corruptions known. Bad laws, and contradictory or outdated legal ideologies are brought to light. Publications like Prisoner Express give voices to those of us stuck inside a broken prison system that’s forgotten its purpose: rehabilitation. The public is now being made aware of *our* tax dollars being diverted from rehabilitation and used instead for the cheapest form of warehousing. And for that exposure, I am thankful.

I am thankful for those that work to expose corruption.

I constantly exercise my right to free speech. The prisons were a little reluctant at first in its allowance--but, now, ten years into it … they respect the truth. And for that, I’m not only thankful, but I returned the respect by only writing of factual events in my snail-mailed posts, and trying always to tell things from both sides, and all angles. Over the years, I think it’s helped me to become a better write, and a better person.

Writing, has been my mode of personal growth.

I’m thankful for those here trying to repair the Southern Justice System, as they call it. Driving out its impurities wherever found. If we could only get a non-conformed, fresh set of candidates to run for South Carolina Governor, and lower offices. We need someone to turn the whole “good ole boy” system on its head. We don’t need another “Trickie Nikki” or another F-ing lawyer in the office. We need someone with science in their background, that goes by the facts instead of the prayer circle and the bank deposit record. We need a complete state-wide rebuild, one that will bring South Carolina up to par with other states in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Get us out of the bottom five (or so) in the nation and up past the 25 positions. Is South Carolina reaching at least the middle too much to ask? I hate that the education here is so low. More resources need to be devoted to STEM, and liberal arts! The prison population of S.C.’s future will be greatly reduced by changes in the laws--making them more fair-- and a devotion to education, not just of the current prison population, but of all schools statewide of all ages.

I’m not the only one that sees this.

And some are actively trying to change it. And for that, I’m thankful. Our current DEFAULT governor, represents the old South Carolina. He’s the kind to take offense from an essay like this--despite its truth. The South Carolina Department of Corrections, SCDC, is--post-economic-fall--going through some changes, to say the least. It’s now obvious to the public, that laws set in place in the mid- to late ‘90s, are no longer sustainable, or even make sense. So, those laws that screwed everything up, are now being revisited-- and some have already been changed. And for that, we are ALL thankful. A complete sentencing reformation is inevitable. The only way to reduce the killings taking place here, will be to put hope back into the hearts and minds of prisoners. A prisoner without hope, or any human (or animal) without hope-- is a dangerous thing.

So, if you’re an honest, unbiased, science savvy person in need of a legacy--come to South Carolina, run for office, show them how it’s done. And for that, we’ll ALL be thankful.
