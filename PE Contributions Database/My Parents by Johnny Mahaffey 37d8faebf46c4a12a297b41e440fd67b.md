**“My Parents” by Johnny Mahaffey**

I do wonder what my father would think if he could see me now --here-- in this prison. Would he then question his own actions? What different life choices? I only met him a few times, so I don’t really know. Maybe he would have stopped drinking? Stayed alive?

Or, at least, tried.

I guess you can’t just stop being an alcoholic. Or maybe you could if you knew the end result, not just for you - but for your child. Then again, I’m a father, and I suspected - know; deep down, what the end result of my life choices would be.

My mother has the opportunity to tell me what she thinks about me --here-- in this prison. But it’s just easier to send a card every now and then. At least, I know where I get my procrastination from! Denial. Self-absorption. Bad- or to say it a nicer way - absent parenting. There; not there; along for the ride. That’s the way it was for me, as I made my mistakes. It wasn’t that I didn’t or don’t care, I just wasn’t in full control.

THere is no rehabilitation here, no jobs, no opportunity to become anything better. I’m surrounded by parentless children trapped in men’s bodies, and everyone has become embittered. The system is so broken, it has been for over a decade (or two), and there’s little hope on the horizon. We can each blame it on our parents, but ultimately we are who we are, and there’s little that can change that.

Acclimation to prison only serves to exacerbate criminality for many prisoners - it’s what separates the “prisoner” from the “inmate/convict/con”.

Mom and Dad would be proud…
