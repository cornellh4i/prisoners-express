***Hunger* by Steven Lee Adkins Jr.**

If you come any closer, I will attack you. Fear is a stranger to me. I am lean and in the prime of life. Something those before me, who made sacrifices so I could simply exist, can be proud of. I’m hungry. Hungry from the sacrifices I’ve made so my mate and pups will survive, so they too, can simply exist. What, you thought I was a loner? No, surface appearances rarely describe accurately what's deeper within, than your cursory judgements convey.

My family isn’t far from here. Sheltered in an abandoned house on a forgotten farm. Its door hanging half open from one rusted hinge. That’s why I’m blocking your path. Why you can’t go any further. If you try, both of our blood will paint the snow and you’ll have completely forgotten about trespassing into my domain. Just go your way and I’ll go my own. We’ve wasted enough time sizing one another up. I could’ve caught a rabbit or a sleeping pheasant, or scavenged some scraps by now. Or stole something, anything so that we can survive. I stole a chicken three days ago. It’s warm blood on my tongue nearly drove me mad. But I carried it back to that abandoned house, to my family. Salivating, I dropped the chicken by my family and was already heading back to find something for myself to eat, before my mate had fully got to her feet from the bedding she had gathered there.

The chicken was completely drenched from my watering mouth. I’m so very hungry. You’d better go, I’m not thinking clearly. The longer I stare into your wide eyes, the more I think I could take you...I think I could eat you.
