**The Real Debts by Benjamin Penny**

I’ll have 25 years, 1 month incarcerated, out of 39 years 1 ½ month living. Most in my situation would believe, based on erroneous victimhood feelings, that society owes them a debt. My earliest release after required parole programs is 3/5/23, and maybe then I can repay my debts and live a life outside. Let me tell you my debt story.

9/17/93, my mother turned my 12 year old self into the police. This after abandoning me at 6 months to age 2, and picking me up only to uproot and replant me every 9 to 12 months. At least once per school year I had to make new friends at a new school in a new neighborhood. Texas, California, Texas, Michigan, Texas, Massachusetts, Texas, incarcerated. She’s a runner; she drank, drugged, sexed, and blamed, I learned.

In the Texas Youth Commision (juvenile prison) I learned how to get beat up, to fear, to hate, and how to blame better. Luckily, they also taught me how to identify thinking errors and how to analyze behavior to determine the motivations behind thoughts and actions. Of course I twisted this to manipulate - staff and peers alike. To an abusive home I couldn’t go and had nowhere else.

4/20/99: At 17 I went to Dallas for independent living. They paid my rent, never teaching me independent living. I parted with a tribe of gays, lesbians, and drag queens at The Village Station, Sue Ellens, and the Z Bar, losing 20 pounds of physique, didn’t work, paid no bills, lived like a homeless street kid, and almost made 3 months before locked up again. “They should’ve actually taught me skills for responsible living habits” I turned 18 four days later in Dallas County Jail.

12/23/99: They released me. For 14 months I floated around aimlessly: job to job, house to house, girlfriend to girlfriend. Angry at Mom and Step-Dad for being the same idiots with my siblings as with me, I ran everywhere but home. I was no better role model. I did as Mom taught me: sex, drugs, rock’n’roll, blame the world, and I got 5 years in prison.

3/3/06: I returned home. Mom and Step-Dad still faught, argued and drank like fish. I ran, sleeping anywhere but home. I found a girl just like Mom who broke my heart. She cheated by prostituting herself. On a sex binge, I picked up a teenager and got 30 years. I was free for 6 months.

“It wasn’t my fault.” Society owed me. Never collected on that debt :) I couldn't understand why all the world was against me. After 14 years 8 months in one institution or another, lost, and the Truth found me. I haven’t been the same since.

No one ever owed me. I grew up poor, in ghettos, with abusive alcoholics, and constantly moving; TYC from 12 to 18, prison, and more prison is exactly what was owed to me. Life isn’t poker where you go “all-in,” lose, and walk away. I got what I got in life (like so many others), and looked at it all wrong (like so many others). Taught to live on nothing; to adapt to new environments; to let pain and frustration roll off of me; and to move on with life. At 29, all TYC’s Resocialization and Cognitive Life Skills rushed back. I learned how life maps from unmet needs to critical situations, to internal reactions, preparing to offend, offending, and then avoiding consequences.

My debt is to take what life gives me and work with it. To be a living example to “victims” like me and building a world instead of destroying it or letting skills and resources stagnate or pine away. This world only gives what it has - the chance to learn. Whether you do or not will determine your debts.
