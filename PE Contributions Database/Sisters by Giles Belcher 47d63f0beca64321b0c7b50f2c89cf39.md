**Sisters by Giles Belcher**

That’s a bond that can’t be broken that I know of. I have two daughters, Taylor and Heather, age 21 and 17 years old. What I know of them is that they love each other, fight with one another, and fight for the other when it's called for. Both are very outgoing people from what is seen and told to me. One is sensitive to things around her, and the other just doesn’t care - happy go lucky! One a red-head, another is brownish-blonde, both blue-eyed young women. Both are argumentative with each other when they disagree, but they talk out all things. I am proud of them both, pray for those two daily, and love them with all my heart. I want them both to do and be better than their father. It is all I can ask and pray for. May these both be more and better than their father was. It’s all I can say and do at this point in time.
