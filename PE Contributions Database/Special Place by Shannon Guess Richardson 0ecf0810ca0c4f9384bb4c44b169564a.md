"Special Place" by Shannon Guess Richardson

Everyone has their own special place. Their retreat. Their heaven. This is mine.

You can’t tell from the picture, but I have a hammock in the back between the trees. It is amazing what lying in the hammock can do for one’s mood. Lying there listening to the waves of the water, the birds in the air, and the breeze through the trees… just describing it to you brings about a peace in my spirit.

My home is simple. You see, I don’t require much anymore. I used to be so materialistic, my clothes wouldn’t even fit in my home that you see now. A lot has happened to change me.

Prison changed me. I always considered myself to be a good person, but I was also very materialistic. I had to have all of the trendy clothes. I had to have the shoes to match. Oh, don’t forget the purses and jewelery! After all, accessories make the outfit, right?

Prison has a way of taking all of that right out of you. As for as pants goes, you have 3 options--khaki uniform pants that don’t fit, gray sweatpants, or gray shorts. When deciding what shirt to wear, you have a few more options--a brown t-shirt, a khaki button-up shirt, a gray t-shirt, and a gray sweatshirt. When it comes to accessories, the options are even more limited. They sell one pair of earrings on commissary. That’s your only accessory--unless you buy something off of someone else, but that takes money I simply don’t have.

Prison has humbled me and brought me to my knees. I no longer have the need to fill my life with stuff. This is why my simple home is perfect for me.

Being separated from my children has put a hole in my heart that I can’t imagine ever being whole again. I went from never being away from my children to having no contact whatsoever--their father won’t allow it. Unless you’ve been in this some heart-wrenching situation, you can’t imagine the pain this brings. Words simply can’t describe it. THis is the reason I chose such a peaceful place to live. It hasn’t healed my heart, and maybe it never will, but my surroundings keep my spirit at peace-most days.

Being claustrophobic is not a good thing when you’re in prison. Have you ever heard of a “paddy wagon?” Let me describe it for you. Imagine the back of a normal-sized van. Split that in two and put in a metal cage. Imagine 5’9” claustrophobic me riding in that! Once I survived that, I was locked in a cell not much bigger than that--with 2 other people. That’s where I am locked down for 4 pm count and all night. This is why I need a place that is open. I have been closed in for too long. Did you notice that I took the front door off? That’s because I refuse to be locked in anymore.

What’s unusual about all of this? When you look at my name in the system, beside it reads, “escaped by death.” That’s what they call it when you die in prison before you are released. They’re right, I did escape because now I am free. Now my spirit lives on and I am at peace. Feel free to come and visit. You will never want to leave. I didn’t. But you’ll have to find your own special place to stay--this one is mine.
