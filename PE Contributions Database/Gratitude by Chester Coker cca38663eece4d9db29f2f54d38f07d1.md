**Gratitude by Chester Coker**

Driving down the country road, a white house was pointed out to me. It sat up on a hill. As the car slowed and turned into the driveway that wound its way toward my summer vacation, I caught glimpses of the barn, some sheds and the chicken coop. The cornfield was already taller than me, taller than anyone in the world.

Then I saw it. It was the same white color as the house with the same yellow trim. It looked like a narrow version of Grandpa and Grandma’s house. “What’s that?” I asked. “The bathroom,” answered my dad.

After all the hoopla of greeting, the hugs and hello’s, my brother and I ran out to the outhouse. I opened the door and was fascinated; I couldn’t wait. This was going to be great. When you are nine, you’ve already peed on everything and everywhere. So the chance to poop in a hole still had an attraction. At just about the time I was unsnapping my wranglers, my dad yelled, “boys, don’t fall in there, we’d never be able to get you out!”

I don’t know how, but in the blink of an eye, I was hyper-focused and crazy afraid. The hole suddenly seemed like it was two feet across, and the mantra in my mind was “fall in--never out, fall in.” I could feel some strange tug pulling me into the abyss. I got out of there without thinking twice.

My brother, two sisters, and I were spending half a summer there. I was brave, adventurous, and creative. The first couple of days were simple. I was curious the first time that I realized my poop was gone. A week into it, a couple of chickens followed me around the side of the house. It wasn’t easy trying to take a dump with a bunch of chickens pushing you around.

Chickens are snitches. They tell everybody. I had to hide from the chickens just to use the restroom. I came strolling out of the cornfield with about thirty hens on my heels. I looked like the Pied Piper. I actually felt like a king with his court. Then grandpa tells me “you know them are them same chickens you been eating? You stop feeding them chickens shit.” “I’m not” I’d say. He’d just looked at me.

I remember exactly how I felt. You don’t have to lie to grandpa; you don’t need to or think to. So the first time I did it seared into my memory. I didn’t take it back or apologize. I quit feeding the chickens though. My shame was a more powerful motivation. I used the outhouse every day. I quit being a chicken. My gratitude is to the chickens, because of them I had to overcome fear, shame, and embarrassment. I found inner strength.
