**“Picture Theme” by William Swiderski**	

When I see a kid with a musical instrument I think of when I first picked up a guitar. At first I sounded terrible. Learning to just play chords you would have thought I was on stage in front of thousands cheering me on. But It was only my nana who told me I sounded great. But that was enough for me.

Now. As I look back 40 plus years I had more fun sounding terrible than you would expect a kid to have. I guess learning something new doesn't come easy but if it’s fun and you have a nana like mine cheering you on then be a 9 year old kid and play on you crazy diamond.
