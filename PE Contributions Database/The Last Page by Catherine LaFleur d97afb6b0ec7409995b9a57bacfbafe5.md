**“The Last Page” by Catherine LaFleur**

The sun is blinding on this Spring Everglades morning. I hurry along on the way to meditation class because today dada, *brother*, a traveling monk is coming to our prison. He stands in front of the building where our class will be held; his bright orange robes flap in the breeze. Dada looks like an exotic peony as he waves to the line of inmates pushing past to the recreation yard. A few stop, confused at the sight of this colorful character and wave back. But no one comes over to find out who dada is. Only the twelve members of class step out of the crowd.

Once inside the classroom, I sit in lotus position and clear my mind. Today I will be coloring outside the lines. Dada guides me with his voice to a forest glade with a calm pool. A droplet of water plinks into the pool in intervals. As I sit beside the pool, a book appears on my lap. Upon opening the book, an image of a person whom I love forms on the page. I follow dada’s spoken mantra silently in my head while gazing at the person’s face.

May this person be whole, mat this person be healthy, may this person by happy, may this person find peace.

A drop of water falls into the pool and I turn the page. Another person’s image forms except this is a person I’ve had a conflict with. I repeat the mantra: whole...healthy...happy...peaceful. Dada leads me through several pages and I release each person until I come to the last page. The image that forms is indistinct, dark and murky. Suddenly there it is, the twinge like a tickle in the back of the throat right before tears begin to fall.

I can’t recall too much of what happened. His face and clothes are blank to me. I only see the back of his head on the page, thick hair trailing slightly over his collar. Of course he had a knife. They usually have something: a knife, a gun, brute strength or the element of surprise.

He doesn’t speak at first, just punches me in the face. I fall down onto stuffed trash bags. One of them breaks as I land on it. Next he’s holding the blade to my face just under my left eye. I try to remember what I learned at a rape awareness seminar I attended in college.

Don’t resist. Don’t struggle. Don’t fight. Don’t do anything that might cause your attacker to kill you.

My skirt rips along with a part of my mind, which flies away from my body. The assault seems to drag on and on but is really over in minutes. I’m safe in my detached refuge watching what is happening to my body lying on the ground.

I can’t feel anything in this moment, not even anger, which comes later. I’m just relieved it looks like he’s going to be done soon. He groans and goes limp. It’s over. I snap back into my body. He’s heavy and leaning on my chest. I can’t catch my breath but I try to push him off. Then his fingertips brush across my face, closing my eyelids as he turns my head away to the wall. I’m waiting for the blade on my throat, but he pushes hard on my shoulders and gets to his feet. Then he’s gone.

The cold air slices my body; rolling to my knees I push my skirt back down and hold the torn edges together. The car isn’t too far away. I fumble with my keys and manage to lock the door. Finally, I get the car open and collapse into the passenger seat, crawl behind the steering wheel and engage the automatic locks. I sit and sit until I start screaming, shaking and banging the car with my fists. I’m so mad at myself. Why didn’t I fight him, hit him with my fist or at least with my big purse?

But that was years ago and today I am sitting by a calm pool of water. Droplets hit the surface one by one. Like an old soldier, I am looking at this wound clear of shrapnel and long healed. Almost. Almost, I am saying the words with gritted teeth and turning the last page.

May this person be whole, may this person be healthy, may this person be happy, may this person be at peace.
