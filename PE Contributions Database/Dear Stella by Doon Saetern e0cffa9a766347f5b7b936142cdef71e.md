**Dear Stella by Doon Saetern**

Hey, what’s up? How you’ve been? I hope you are doing well. As for myself, I’m all in my feelings right now … I can’t ever focus. I’ve been staring off into space fluctuating through time. Trying to find the right words to say to you is like trying to find life on another planet, and the amount of pain that’s involved doesn’t help.

For these past few months I’ve been thinking about you a lot. My celly’s the only person in the whole entire world who knows how much you really mean to me. All the sacrifices that you made, and all the love that you gave, helped create memories for me that will never fade.

I wish I had the courage to reach out to your cousin, and ask for your info. The reason why I don’t … is because of all the things me and your cousin have been through.

If I was at home, or even had access to a phone, things would be a lot different. I feel so powerless here. I’m way out of my element.

I force myself to do things I don’t want to do. The only good thing about that is sometimes when I connect the dots, I discover things about myself and everyday eke I never knew.

One of the most painful things I had to learn to embrace this year is that no one understands me. Some people think I’m out of my mind … Not realizing the main reason why I act a certain way is to make them laugh and see them smile.

I guess I don’t deserve their empathy … Not even your’s. I’ve neglected it in the past so how the fuck can I ask for more?!

Please don’t worry about me. I’m doing just fine. I just got a lot of stuff on my mind … Like what’s the point of keeping my head up high when I can’t even get a clearer view of the cold desert sky, to see if our stars are once again aligned?

If you don’t mind, I’m just going to keep on writing. Hopefully it will make everything between us right and … eventually give me the opportunity to explain to you in person what happened with me that night when … you texted me … predicted my destiny … about where the HELL I’m going to be the moment my life ends. Until Next Time.
