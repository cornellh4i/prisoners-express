**“Little feet” by Monica Ullom**

These tiny little feet

Oh, the roads that you will travel

Thousands of miles you will tread

Which paths will you choose to wander?

Paths they lead you down dark alleyways

With drugs and heartache or

Paths that lead you to alter giving your life to Jesus? A true and trusted friend.

To be sure these little feet will get boo-boos

And be sore along the way

Blessed are the feet that bring the good news

Will you be a little talebearer, a journalist

Or an evangelist, teaching others far away?

These little feet are so tiny and tender

Innocent, smelling so sweet

I hope these feet take you places filled with friends and loved ones, and delicious things to eat

When all is said and done and these feet are wrinkled, bent, and beat

I hope they walk those streets of Gold

Where we’ll both, one again, have beautiful little feet.
