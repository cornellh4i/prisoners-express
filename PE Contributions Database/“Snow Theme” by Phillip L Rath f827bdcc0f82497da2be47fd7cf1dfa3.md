**“Snow Theme” by Phillip L. Rath**

Snow stream, a cold but reassuring scene of perpetuity. The moisture in the clouds turns to snow and falls to Earth. The sun melts the snow which soaks into the earth. The moisture in the earth flows downward until it collects more moisture and forms a stream through freshly fallen snow.

This is a frequent event in northwest Nebraska, where I’m from. Snow streams are a fresh, wonderful reminder that this circle of life started millions of years ago and inspires hope that they will exist millions of years in the future.

No such freshness exists in the cities or southern United States. I pity those who will never know the experience of drinking from a snow stream.
