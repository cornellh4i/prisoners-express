**“Dog Pound” by Steven P. Arthur**

His name was Buddy. He was two and I was five years-old. He was my best friend, confidant, and keeper of my secrets. He knew when I was happy, sad, or just needed to run off some sugar-fueled energy. He was my protector; from animals big and small. We swam in the ponds, streams, and irrigation ditches. We ran in the cotton fields, and chased down lizards; who detah their very own tails to get away from us. We shared a room, and against my Mom’s permission, sometimes my bed. He finished what ice cream remained on my hands and face. Buddy lived a long and healthy life, but for a dog like buddy, it was still too short. I was eleven, still a child myself, but Buddy had grown up and got old, a life well lived. Not a week goes by that I don’t think about that dog, that animal, that midnight barker, he was my Buddy.
