“Namesake” by William Andrews

He was a big man, and nearly blind, my grandfather was. An accident at a furniture factory completely destroyed one eye, later replaced with a glass eye, and damaged the other. That happened early during his long life of 96 years. I met him maybe a total of 10 times throughout my entire time of knowing him. He resided in my dad’s hometown, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge in Virginia, a little town named Pulaski, for nearly his entire life.

Before the world became merely dark shadows seen through his damaged eye, he worked as a field detective for the CIO. It was some sort of labor organization in the 1940’s. I’m not fully sure what that entailed, but I found a picture of him in my dad’s stuff after my dad passed away. He looked like Dick Tracy with his hat, strong jaw and squinted eyes, along with a cast of noble, determined looking men, posed for a company picture.

I’m his namesake. A presidential name, or at least it could be. Though I never asked anyone where it stemmed from originally, I’d guess it's from a string of presidents, William, Franklin, Andrews... that’s us.

I remember visiting my granddad as a kid, just old enough to appreciate the uniqueness of an almost fully blind man, living alone in an old apartment located downtown of that Mayberry-like setting, almost like stuck in time, except for the cars and some billboards exposing the current era. Remove those and you could film remakes of those old Twilight Zone episodes there. The ceiling of his apartment was very high and the doors were sturdy and tall, as most were back in the 40’s.

He collected various things, some odd things, that he maybe liked the feel of in his large hands. Skeleton keys, silver dollars, old glass door knobs that looked like large crystals filled a box catching the dim light, and after each short visit, he’d give us some sort of heirloom to hold on to, always reminding us kids to save for the future.

In the 1970’s, my dad showed me a picture on the frontpage of the Pulaski newspaper. It was of my granddad standing there, in front of his apartment front door, pointing his red tipped cone towards something on the door, and a policemen looking at it with a sheepish grin on his face. Someone had tried to kick in the door while my grandad was there. He was well known in that town, along with his handicap, so the would-be-intruder marked him as an “easy” target.

Little did he know, a blind man's aim can still be fairly true, and as the thug was kicking on the well-made door, my granddad was aiming his 32 snubnose aligned atop his cane towards the noise… Five shots were sent through the door, which sent the would-be-robber limping away, and later caught at a local hospital.

Many years later, I went to visit him, as a young man with a girlfriend by my side. He seemed much smaller, almost frail, but still sharp and aware as ever. Still alone. This would be my final visit, for the years afterward would lead me to a place too far away to visit again, so it seemed.

My life blurred for a while. Family and friends either disappeared or gradually became people I no longer knew.

I received a letter at work in the middle of pulling a transmission from a vehicle. I’m guessing it was the only address my uncle could trace me to, probably by the SSN number. It told me of my granddads long death, having spent most of his life savings on medical bills and hospice, until my uncle just brought him home to die at his place. I’ll always remember my grandad as a giver, as strong and independent… my namesake--
