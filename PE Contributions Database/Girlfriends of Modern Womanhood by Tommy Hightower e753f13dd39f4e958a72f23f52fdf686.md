***Girlfriends of Modern Womanhood* by Tommy Hightower**

****“You go girl!” Today we can be so much more than our mothers’ generation. Being a modern woman means others blazed the trail that I’m benefitting from. My sister Mary is a pioneer of modern womanhood. She and I are ‘60s children, and as children, we saw most women as homemakers, and women made 50 cents to every dollar a man made for the same job.

Mary was tired of being told she couldn’t see her dreams fulfilled. She was a woman and a divorced mother who refused to be that passive “June Cleaver” character from “Leave it to Beaver” in Post-WWII America. She put herself through private high school with hard work and supreme study skills. She threw off the shackles of being a passive partner in any abusive marriage. She chose to join the Army, to fight as part of combat groups and to become a nuclear weapon specialist, a female officer. She was the first in a long list of fields women never delved into before her.

Mary then joined corporate America. Becoming a fast rising female executive in the all boys club, yet never gave up on being a good mother. She climbed the corporate ladder while demanding the weekends as her own for family time.

Today, girlfriends of the 21st century enjoy such a wide open field to pursue their interests, only because of women like my sister Mary, a child of the ‘60s who blazed in a trail of overcoming sex discrimination for the sake of her daughters’ and granddaughters’ generations. Never stop striving today, for so much more hurdles still lay in the way of true gender equality. But please, say thank you to these girlfriends who came before you.

Mary, you go girl. You earned kudos for a job well done in gender equality.
