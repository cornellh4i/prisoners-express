**Tricky Business by Myron Martens**

It was nearly two decades ago when I was introduced to the YPALS mentorship program. I met my current mentor through this YMCA program for “At Risk” youth-YPALS. After two failed matches we clicked almost instantly. He was everything I wanted to be and everything I wasn’t. The more I hung out with him. The more I admired and respected him. He had his life together.

His name is Paul. He is an expert in the information technology field (IT), something I’ve had a passion for all my life. He had his own home, a nice vehicle and a great job in the field. He’s also a web developer, something else I loved. He was in the AirForce, signifying to me a highly trained individual and in my estimation, highly successful.

After a while, he let me stay with him for a time when my mom kicked me out at an early age. But like a faithful he was there for me when I graduated Tarheel Challenge Academy (TCA) Boot camp and he opened up his doors for me again until I went off to trade school. He took me to the RDU Airport to catch school to Chicago. He was very helpful to me.

Chicago is where I awaited a bus to a trade school in Kentucky where I studied hard and earned certificates in Business Technology, Microsoft and Apple's-Hardware and Software troubleshooting. I was then hired right out of school by a local corporation as a technical support specialist. There I handled PC and internet related issues. It was an easy job and I loved it.

I bought myself a truck, got me a small rental to live in and I was firmly established there in Kentucky doing what I loved. But I moved back here to NC after two short years because my little sister needed me.

Upon returning to NC. Paul and I began to develop business partnerships. I started up two computer repair companies-ASAP and Gaston Technology through the years. He hooked me up some domain space on his web server since he’d already done web development with network solutions. So I started developing websites for my clients.

We kept a consistent dialogue on the rapidly growing computer tech industry. It was hard for me to keep up. We had business accounts with Sprint for years until he got fed up with them and we moved on to Verizon. Often I would seek his expertise on computer related issues and occasionally he’d send me a repair job.

My good friend and mentor Paul is definitely, without a doubt, the best business partner I ever had. He is an honest, noble, man of God who I trust and I am truly grateful for him. Now he comes to the tricky part.

One day I stumbled into a deal with one of niy ASAP partners who need me to host a router or server-some physical networking hardware-on my network. The job seemed simple enough, the only problem was that they rewired a Time Warner Cable Connection. I had a charter.

The awesome thing about this deal was that the partner would pay the entire bill for hosting their hardware. As much as I wanted this deal for myself, I just couldn’t get TWC in my area. I mean, who wouldn't want their cable, internet and phone bill paid each month. That’s nearly $1,500 a year in savings at 120$ a month, which is about what my charter business bundle cost back then.

So as a token of my appreciation and gratitude for all the good business and kindness he’d shown me over the years. I gave that deal to my great and awe -inspiring mentor Paul. He was, no doubt, more qualified than me anyways. But, in all this, I’ve learned a little secret to life called the “Boomerang principle.”

Wrapped up inside this principle It states, “Give and it will be given unto you. Good measure, pressed down, shared together, running over will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.”(Saint Luke) give, and like a boomerang: It comes back to you.

Paul my PALS mentor - has not forgotten about me in my incarceration either. He regularly responds with me by mail and he loyally provides the funds for most of my canteen purchases. And for this Tricky Business I am in, I am truly and forever grateful anyhow.
