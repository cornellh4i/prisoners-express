**The Goat’s Leg Messenger by W.B. James Jackson**

I’m detective JamJack for precinct 409 of Metro City. I’d been solely assigned to the Peculiar Crimes Unit.  I’d been pursuing the perp known as Coy “The Goat’s Leg Messenger” for nineteen months. My superiors told me long ago to turn the case over to the Feds. They were ready to fire me. Everyone thought it all a joke. The daily rag that called itself a newspaper had already used some pretty judgemental words to describe my investigation; words like asinine, moronic, and a waste of taxpayer’s money, but I was three months past retirement and had no intention of handing in the shield until I’d put Coy behind bars.

This criminal mastermind had a most macabre M.O. He’d break into businesses or vehicles and steal obscure items, then he’d leave a goat’s leg with a strange message attached by a ribbon. The Pot Smoking Chimps that passed for the Intelligence Division refused to listen to my observation that the messages were not riddles. It took them four months and eight goat’s legs to concur.

The G. L. M. had broken into an S.U.V. and stole a 30 dollar wig; leaving a bloody goat leg attached to the steering wheel like a sick version of “the Club” auto theft device. On the leg was a message that said “the best part of waking up is goat’s leg in your cup.” He broke into a hardware store and stole a spool of rope, and left a goat’s leg on the counter with the message “all I need in this life of sin is me and my goat’s leg.” The most disturbing of all was the Dollar Store heist. I got a break with some DNA and video surveillance. He’d stolen a purse and some lady’s hygiene products. The note on his gory calling card said “hey goat’s leg, no we can’t get together. No, we can’t talk at all.”

The footage showed Coy shaving his legs in the chip aisle, drinking a Dr. Pepper. I took a hair sample and ran it in the 409’s lab; cleverly disguised as a closet. I came up with a match for Coy, and I discovered that Homeland Security wanted him for questions on goat smuggling charges from Mexico. I’d no idea where those goats were, but their legs were right here in Metro.

I got a tip from one of his old crew mates. Johnny C, “The Twerk King.” Johnny had beef with Coy, and spilled the beans. Coy knew that I was getting close and bought a ticket to catch the train out of Metro. No time to fill out the 98 Page Form for a vehicle. I had to hoof it.

I ran 15 blocks before I saw Sal “The Sausage Guy.” I was in a hurry so I got a footlong with onions, peppers, coleslaw, relish, cheddar cheese, horseradish sauce, and bacon bits with a soda and a snickerdoodle cookie. Then ran the other 8 blocks to the station. Somehow I forgot to pay Sal (so focused on police business) so he called it in.

I made it to the terminal. It looked deserted except for a lady, leaning up against a column. Some officers had made it to the platform as I looked for any sign of Coy. “JamJack, you’ve gone too far now” said one of the cops. At that moment the train came in sight. Then the lads turned. Dammit, it was Coy with stocking on. That’s why he shaved his legs. “JamJack, we got to take you in,” said a cop. They were big fellas. They grabbed me and I screamed: “Arrest that man dressed as a moderately attractive broad, that’s the goat’s leg messenger.” They laughed. “Sure thing, let’s get you in the car” I screamed “He’s getting away.” They got rough, and put me on the ground. I wrestled with them.

“You’re not fooling anyone Coy with that cheap wig on. Give yourself up,” I said. He just looked at me with indifference. Yet I was still confused. All the heists made sense except for the hardware store. Why the rope? “Dammit Coy, you’ve got a goat’s leg tied around your waist with rope don’t ya? I fought hard against the two cops. Dammit man, arrest that broad, at least look under his dress. There’s a goat’s leg under there,” I screamed. “It’s a dude, it’s the Goat’s Leg Messenger, look under the dress.” They hit me in the head, hard. I blacked out.

I’ve been here at Metro Mental ever since, loaded on pills and jello. Yet burned in my mind is Coy with nice legs and sensible shoes, and a goat’s leg somewhere under that dress.

I’ll get you yet, Coy. I’ll get you yet.
