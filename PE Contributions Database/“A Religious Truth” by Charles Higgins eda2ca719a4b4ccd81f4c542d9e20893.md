**“A Religious Truth” by Charles Higgins**

By reading the Sacred Pages, I’ve been inspired to believe in David rather than Goliath, look for favor from our Father’s Law and abide by it. I choose to call Him Yahweh as His Names have been provided, just as scripture says and every witness said. To be revelling and celebrating in Chr*stmas is misled, there are other Holy Feasts we eat unleavened bread. People should be educating themselves in history, instead of all these pagan religious theories and what they believe Yahshua the Messiah died next to two repentant thieves what the wealthy didn’t give you, the wealthy won’t receive. Follow his example, have faith in His Name and believe.
