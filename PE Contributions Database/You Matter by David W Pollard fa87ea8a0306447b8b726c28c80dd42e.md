**You Matter by David W. Pollard**

**P**ut them in cages and throw away the keys

**R**eturning again and again put ‘em on their knees

**I**nside walls and fences now numbers not names

**S**laves of the system no more fun and games

**O**utside the world continues oblivious to their pleas

**N**obody ever grows up thinking they’ll go to jail

**E**very boy and girl has hopes they’ll never fail

**R**eaching for the prize some take the wrong turn

**S**uddenly freedom’s removed as they watch dreams burn

**L**osing everything and now only looking forward to mail

**I**t’s a lonely existence where everyone is so cold

**V**ictimization abounds when dignity and honor are sold

**E**very now and then a lone figure stands tall

**S**peaking a truth that accepts one and all

**M**aking some reevaluate the lies they’ve been told

**A**re you not in charge of your life, master of your fate

**T**o choose your own attitude, picking love not hate

**T**elling yourself there’s nothing you can’t do

**E**ager for one more change to live this life true

**R**ealizing you’re vital to make a difference is never too late
