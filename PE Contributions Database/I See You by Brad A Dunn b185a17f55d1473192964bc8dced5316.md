**I See You by Brad A. Dunn**

I see you, do you see me, I hope so

If you cross that river between us, it’s a go

It’s not that I’m mean or a bully or even bad

I’m hungry, it’s what I do, I don’t have rabies, I’m not mad

Look at me, do I look scared, I hope you got a gun

Because if you don’t, I’m gonna chase you, that’s what I do for fun

I am the alpha male, you are second to me

If I were you, I would quit staring and get up off your knew

I have cubs to feed and a mate who is very demanding

Even though it’s winter, I can’t come back without food, she’s not understanding

In your eyes, you got to see a wild animals, made your day

In my eyes, you’re the biggest food I’ve seen in weeks, you’re my prey

I wish I could show you my playful side, show you my howl

RIght now all I can show is my teeth and my growl

But once you see my fangs and hear my battle call

I would suggest you run and by no means, don’t fall

What’s that on your hip, food, no, oh you brought a knife

So you’re not scared either, you mean to take my life

You wish to cut off my hide and lay me in front of your fireplace

Well it won’t be easy, I also have claws to cut up your face

To win, to be the victor, you got to stay on your feet

For me, that’s easy, I got 4, so if you slip, you’re fresh meat

Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just be friends

You could pet me, we could hunt together, two old enemies making amends

You came to feed your ego, make a trophy out of me

I came to feed my family, I see you, do you see me?
