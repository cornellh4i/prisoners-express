I have a problem with names. It must be genetic. Growing up my parents used to call me by each other’s names, Alain or Virginie…. And by the dog’s name which was Fifi. I got called Fifi a lot.

Whenever we got in the car to go somewhere, my parents would play the name game. Their memories left something to be desired. My father would start to talk about movies and would ponder the name of this or that actor. My mother, who was heavily involved in church activities, would forget the name of a particular church member. As a captive in the back seat, I would have to listen to these endless discussions of who is who. I had to develop protection early, so I started memorizing names. Now, once I see a written name, I have a difficult time forgetting it. It’s one of my positive superpowers.

At the Camp Prisoney Land Library, there was a revolt of the law clerks and the secretary. They all quit. So it was just me, the typist, 654 inmates, and the work release centers. They all got to spend six weeks of quality time alone with me.

Yay!

Because the secretary quit, another inexperienced inmate had to step Into the breach. Adelie has done an excellent job of supporting me but a few things slipped through the cracks. As mentioned I had to wait on the work release center inmates. A few came through. Unfortunately they were not logged by the secretary. When it came time to make the monthly report, the names of those inmates who had received services were a mystery because I don’t write them down. That is the secretary’s job. Time to activate the superpowers.

The secretary collected the sign-in sheets for all the inmates who entered the library that month. We sat down and I reviewed all the sheets. I totally creeped her out by making a mark on everyone who came in that was assigned to Camp Prisoney Land. If I was unsure, I would close my eyes and do a little humming thing and wiggle my fingers in the air. In truth, I only do that for effect. There were six unfamiliar names. I wrote them down for her. Two of them were the names of the work release people. Magic, right?

Unfortunately, I can’t match names to faces. So half the time when people are talking to me, I have no idea who they are. I have to look at their name tags. You would think I would be able to remember people’s nicknames. Alas, I cannot. There are too many. And people don’t pick original names. Philadelphia, Texas, Velvet, Tay, Murder. These are not very original. Maybe if they picked something like Honey-Boo-Boo Lips, I might remember that. Instead I have the government name in my memory selector. Sorry if your name Is Eunice, Bobbi-Rae-Sue, Norma, etc. If it’s not thug enough for your tastes you should take that up with your parents, Tiffany. Or the person whose identity you stole. And I am sorry you are identifying as a boy now, Amanda. It’s just too hard to remember your new nickname. In fact, if I am too confused about whom I am speaking to, you’ll be lucky if I get the first letter right.

One day I was serving one of my clients in confinement. The girl’s real name was Shanna Kurlew. Thus her nickname, Shank. She was in administrative confinement. That day I was in a hurry and I was tired. When I called her to the door, I mistakenly called her Skank. Oops! She leapt as if I’d slapped her through the glass window and said “Ms. LaFleur, how could you!” The officer with me thought that was hysterical and nearly flipped over the second tier railing. I told Shank, you have a choice of Shanna or Kurlew. Pick one.

People often forget my name. I get called by Charlotte, Christine, Lurry, Flora, Floor, McFlurry. One calls me Renee. She is age 74 and when I respond, she remarks how thrilled she is to get my name correct. I tell her you sure did get it right, honey! If I think someone is talking to me I will respond…. Even if you call me Fifi.
