**“Who’s That Lady?” by Jason Omar Moreno**

Sitting on my sofa staring out into the city through the window, I began to think: What doesn't happen out there? People come, and people go. We see it that they go aimlessly. As I’m in deep thought … She comes through the door. She slams her bag on the floor and doesn’t even acknowledge me. She fixes herself a hot cup of tea and then leaves it on the counter. She walks to the window and slowly sits on the floor staring out. Tuning it all out. I sit and watch her every move, but she won’t move. She just looks out over this city, blocking my view of the world outside.

When a woman will not look into a man’s eyes, a man feels overwhelmed, so much crosses his mind.

“What did I do?”

“What was I supposed to do but didn’t?”

“What? Did I forget her birthday? To take out the trash?”

This feeling can hold a man hostage! I remember asking my uncle Chuy,

“I don’t understand girls.” He mumbled,

“Don't worry that’ll change. When you get older, you won’t understand *women.*”

It's uncomfortable on my comfortable sofa.

What is she thinking? In my head I begin to wonder, my conscience screaming, “squirm you measly worm!”

What I do know is that when she leaves this world in her mind I feel more lonely. Then I can stand; I become an island.

She won’t turn to look at me. The room is quiet. Maybe she only needs some “me” time? Do I get up and leave? Do I say something? What if I say the wrong thing?

The first time I laid eyes on her I was mesmerized. We met at a bar. We were just out relaxing on our own. I asked her, “What happens when an immovable object collides with an unstoppable object?”

She looked at me as if I was from another planet. She let me talk, was she listening? …

And I was even able to prove my theory that for every action there is an equal or opposite reaction. She was lost.

She said,

“All you have proven is that you know absolutely nothing about women.” I lost my nerve, I paid my tab and about to walk out when she said,

“Where are you going?”

I said,

“Home.”

“But the night is young,” she said.

I pull out my pen and write down my phone number and give it to her.

“When you want to teach me about women, call me.” A few days later my phone rings. “Hello,” I answer.

“Is this yon?”

“Who?” I reply.

“Thy guy I met at the bar.”

“Who?” And then I did remember. “Oh, hi, hello, how are you?” I say.

She laughs.

“Well, it’s good to know you gave me your real phone number. I’m glad you didn’t pressure me in anyway. Most guys just want one thing and well I thought you are genuine. I mean who would’ve known I’d actually like what you explained to me?”

I wanted to say, “well it was actually the alcohol talking because I really don’t know what I said,” but I said,

“Really? That's a first, not many people pay me that much attention. Really I was trying to impress you. Hey, what if we met somewhere? Where do you like to eat, how about dinner - your treat!” Why not? Women want to be independent so why not see if this was a miss independent?

She said,

“Ok, my treat but you got to explain why water is wet.” It took me all five seconds to guess “I got a live one here”. I said,

“Okay.”

That seems like it's been forever ago. That young woman now mature with real-world issues. Being independent, it seems the world finds reasons to hold her back. Once she explained,

“The hardest question a girl can ever be asked is ‘is it hard being a girl?’ Then she asked me, “Can you be a man in a woman’s world?” I know this was a question that needed an answer like no other,

“Women and girls of the 21st century wear their empowerment on their sleeves. But sometimes I think that all those ‘We can do it’ and ‘girls rule’ T-shirts are meant as much for their own reassurance as they are brave declarations to the world - mantras I hope will carry them into the future. “That they keep and should insist will be female,” I stated. She just stared at me as if I was from another planet. As a man I totally do get it that women are as valuable as the next man. Why can’t we just get along … Whoever coined the phrase “women, can’t live with them - can’t live without them,” understood their true value. But then there's the question, what happens to women when men fail, and the storyteller is a woman? My mother always spoke highly of my father. They spoke to each other with respect. Wasn’t that the deal maker, to have someone honor and respect you?

And watching her sit by the window, I wanted to say something so bad, and I decided to just speak and see what happens … So I say “It’s you I like, It’s not the things you wear, it’s not the way you do your hair, but it’s you I like.”

She is looking out of the window and then responds with,

“Please don’t think it's funny, when you want an extra kiss. There are lots and lots of people who sometimes feel like this.”

We were in the same room after all. Often all this time she has me guessing yet never disappointing.

“I’m here for you when you need me,” I told her. Her eyes turned to meet mine.

“What else could a woman need?” was all she said. She turned her eyes back out to the city and its endless sky. “After all … it’s for me to know and you to find out!”
