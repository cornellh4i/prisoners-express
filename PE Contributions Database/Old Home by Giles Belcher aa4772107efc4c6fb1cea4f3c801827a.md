**Old Home by Giles Belcher**

Man, the structure is at least 100 years old or older. Are stone, bricks, and granite even used in construction? It’s somewhat windy here, even a little bit of a chill air wise! Who lived here and when I couldn’t tell you? Could have been a lighthouse too? I am not sure of that tower though. Some of that brick and stone are crumbling and decaying away from the ravages of time. Any ghosts haunting this place? Don’t know at all? A strongly made, defensible home definitely!

It’s a peaceful, beautiful place this is! I could stay here for a long while and beat defiant peace with this. Root and walls sturdy and good year around living here, just need to get a good lay of the land here? Maybe good growing crops, hunting, possible fishing maybe? If the walls could talk, what would be said? What memories of life would be revealed? Only God and the people who lived here could say! Old world craftsmanship says to time, I am still here and standing tall! Maybe still be standing another 100+ years, don’t know. Gotta look up the history of the area to find out the who’s who, and ways of life here before now! Gotta take this picture and try to come back here soon! Don’t want to leave this place! But got to see the surrounding area too! I’ll see this old home again for sure! Got to! Sunlight setting lower, darkness is coming! Got to go on.
