**“Aspire” by Scott Smith**

Almost is usually descriptive of something that was nearly certain or true at one time. In that sense, it is used reflectively. It can be used to refer to a regret–in that case it is pitiful–it can also refer to a miracle in that instance it is fortunate. Now, when I utilize the definition of almost, I translate it in it’s most present form, and also its most forceful. I use it to describe my current state in measure against where I envision myself to be in the future. In doing so, I have set a likeable and feasible throne which I must reach and powerfully claim soon. To sit when I desire, I most accurately and systematically progress each breathing and deliberate moment towards where I “almost” am, or, where I want to be. This is what or who I almost am.

Those of non-action will slug uselessly in the realm of waste, deceived under good intentions, lazily amounting to nothing. They will never line up to their gilded intentions, because they are devoid of a passion strong enough to urge them into motion. As time passes, those good intentions turn into haunting regrets that possess and haunt the individual. Those intentions, that almost were a priority, never became anything, therefore, were worth nothing to begin with, they were merely delusion.

There are also people of action. All major contributions started first as ideas which all were later to be nothing in hiding, our lives will be transparent. It is better that way. For our brilliance will have the stage. It is this presentation that I desire, and I am almost there.

Today, I utilize my mental microscope to magnify the errors of my ways. For these errors define me almost, they stand between me and my crown. For now, these shortcomings have become my most personal relations, for I stay and dissect them with vigor. I give them no rest, they are constantly assaulted with my skill and efforts. This barrage has made significant progress against my inborn foe and has allowed me to identify the tactics of the enemy. This is good, because I understand the nature and capacity of those idiosyncrasies, they are labeled and marked.

Opposite of these errors lay their counterparts and virtues. This is a strong lot. They are almost in the form that I would deem fitting. I rely on my knowledge so that I will know more. My wisdom reveals the path of least harm and the one of highest potential. Stamina allows me to face all tasks enduringly, and now it sustains me longer than ever. These are few of many that deserve mention and are the paving stones of glory.
