**“Toothless Smile” by Vicki Hicks**

My Yorkie is registered as Sir Rockie Balboa V. He sired many pretty, yappy puppies in his prime. As with any stud, they mark their territory often. Once Rockie’s stud days were over, we decided that he needed to be neutered to calm him down and eliminate the need to mark everything. My days of being down on my hands and knees cleaning up after him were numbered. Fun fact: Did you know that there is a company that makes a belly band for studs? You place a sanitary napkin in the band and velcro it around their studly parts to keep them from breeding and marking their territory. We tried the band for a while only to find that we also had to use wipes to clean him because he would hike and pee in the diaper. I made the appointment to have him neutered. When we got there, he had the saddest look in his eyes. I can only imagine what was going through his mind. After work I went to pick my boy up and the veterinary technician handed me a clear baggie. I thought, *No way are his testicles in that bag*. Sure enough, they weren’t testicles, but a bag full of teeth. She explained that while he was under anesthesia, they went ahead and cleaned his teeth and they all fell out. I was flabbergasted. The technician let me know that there was no charge for the cleaning. I would hope not! My question to her was, “Are you going to pay for doggie dentures?” She laughed and said they don’t make them. Rocky Balboa V still lives today with no teeth and a soft diet. His poor tongue hangs out all the time. Beware, when you take your dog to the vet to get neutered, they may come back missing more than a set of testicles.
