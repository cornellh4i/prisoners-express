**Flyer’s Choice by James Hochschild**

When others think of flying, probably the most common method is by airplane, helicopter, or for an astronaut, a rocketship. There are other methods but I’ll mention them later.

My first experience with an airplane was initially a dreaded one. It was the winter time in which we had a surveying job to perform on South Bass Island in Lake Erie of Ohio. The lake was frozen at the time. So, there was no ferry service available. We had to take an old Cessna plane from the Sandusky, Ohio airport and land on the island, and to return back later in the day. I was in a mild panic while on the plane. And I endured the trip because I valued my job more than the emotional mess I was in at the time. About 15 years later, the next plane trips were on Con-Air of the Federal Bureau of Prisons system. The same dread was there. Yet, I got through it.

A helicopter I haven’t been on, per se. The closest to it were carnival rides that simulated the experience.

As a kid, I dreamed of being an astronaut to go to space which is an extreme case of flying. However, that was a dream I did not pursue, once I got older.

Other methods of flying are hot-air balloon, hang-gliding, parachuting, and jumping off a reasonable height into the water safely.

I would try the hot-air balloon, but not any of the others.

Another method is to simply dream that one is a bird or even a superhero flying through the air. I believe I would get vertigo from the open air up high.

Fear of heights, and falling from heights can be managed like mine. There are those with extreme phobias that need supportive help to get through it. Remember Mr. T on the A-team show as an example.
