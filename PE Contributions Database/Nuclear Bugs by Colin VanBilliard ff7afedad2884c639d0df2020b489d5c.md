***Nuclear Bugs* by Colin VanBilliard**

****I was listening to World News when it said a country unleashed a breed of mosquitoes and yellow jackets called MYN which glow a bright, blackish-yellow in the dark and that this breed took scientists 4 years to research. These MYN are a nuclear experiment, worse than any nuke or plane, and they have a lifespan of 5 years. The news showed the cloud over one city: millions of these bugs were there. How are we going to stop this? We may have to start 2-3 large hurricanes in its path. Many people may die because of this nuclear bug, though they look like Christmas lights in the dark sky.

I ran upstairs to call the President of the United States. Obama picked up, and I said, “Barack, what’s up? I’m calling you about the nuclear bugs that the country released.” Barack responded that they’re working on it, though they never faced something like that. And so I told him to put a hurricane in its path, and Barack told me that it was a good idea. He asked me how old I was, and when I said 10, he told me to stay in school because maybe one day I can become a scientist. I told him I’m going to sit in his chair one day, and so he told me to study hard and that we’ll see what happens if the bugs try to come to the Americas.

***Blood of our Ancestors* by Red Dot**

Red Dot was walking down Main Street when a drop of blood landed on his forehead. When he realized it was blood and saw something in the sky, he dropped his 40 ounce and blunt. He started to hear unclear voices, and he was so scared that he couldn’t run. Another drop of blood, then more, started landing on the sidewalk. It spelled out: “This is the blood of everyone’s ancestors. We love you, Red Dot.” Red Dot looked again, picked up his blunt, and then sat on the curb. He then asked a girl if she saw the cloud, and she told him that he’s crazy. So he got up and showed her where the message was, but she couldn’t see it. Then another drop his him in the face, and Red Dot started crying, “Who is it? Please tell me…” Then everything cleared up without telling Red Dot.
