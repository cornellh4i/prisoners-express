**“The Black Widow” by Lorraine Bennett-Kenitzki**

The black widow feels the greatest of the loss. Her emotions are in a turmoil of loss. The love of her life is gone. She is no longer a wife and now sings a sad song. Without her true love, she is going crazy. Her sight of others has become lazy. Her heart is at a disadvantage, for her one true love was vintage. The black widow feels like a crow of sorrow for her heart will never again be out to borrow.
