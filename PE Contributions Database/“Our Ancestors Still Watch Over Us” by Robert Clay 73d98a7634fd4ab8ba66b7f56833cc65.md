**“Our Ancestors Still Watch Over Us” by Robert Clayton**

****Families are forever. At least, they used to be. Just as leisure is the best part of life when you’re spending it with those hearts created equal to yours. If you don’t have that, for whatever the reason, you may still have enough time to create it.

Marriage, and the blessings that come forth from it, are the vital sparks within all lives. Could you be kind enough to try and picture something for me? A grandparent. In light of being the main artery of your household though, even if you’ve never known yours, there are still several ways through which you yourself might become one.

Adoptions happen all the time, even by those that were themselves formerly an orphan. Every single Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chayah, and Yechidah do not have nationalities or a skin color. Or even a profession of faith. However many have, and do, thought that. Feeling especially set apart. Mostly due to those particular outward attributes.
