**A Close Call by John Naylor**

I think back on so many close calls. You may well know that as prisoners everything we write is read by correctional staff, so there’s a great many close calls that I’m not welcome to share.

I think of Andrew Zimmerman. No, not just because he eats some seemingly disturbing things. No, it’s a philosophy he carries that I believe is a poignant thing he probably learned from his Dad, that there is no better way for people to connect and share each other’s cultures than through food. Well, there used to be a local grocery store in Anderson, Indiana. Pay-less had several locations -- one used to be off of Broadway. I was never the type to pass on samples in any grocery store -- my brother didn’t either. It’s not just because our family were long time customers. There’s not necessarily a sense of entitlement, though if you’re handing them out right in front of me and the store is paying for the food and an employee to hand it out, then I want mine.

The thing is, I’m short compared to adults. Just a country kid unwilling to walk by frying sausage and not partake. My brother ate his first. His expression said all I need to know. So I reach up to the griddle and try to grab a toothpick, and then catastrophe! I had a burn from the hot griddle and grease the entire length of my forearm. Suddenly I went with Mom to customer service for an incident report.

I can’t recall whether I got any of the sausage, which should be clear. If I did, it was only because my big brother Andy grabbed one for me. I think I got some. Not even your own flesh burning can take away from how great free sausage tastes. Of course I could feel by body disagreeing too as the outer layers of my arm had second degree burns.

I went to the E.R. at St. John’s Hospital in Anderson. The doctor confirmed second degree burns and wrote a prescription for the Silvadene burn ointment. Through many products I’ve used, Silvadene is the best (or arguably the best) burn cream. We talked about the medicine and how the injury occurred. “A stupid injury,” I remember thinking. “The whole thing could have come at me, grease and all.” Not a great way to take care of your face, etc.

Mindfulness wasn’t a term I’d heard until prison I think. Awareness isn’t as hippie-sounding. That’s probably why. Though in any case, conservative teachings aside, situational awareness can be very important, like Jeff Cooper taught. Sure, it could have been worse. A close call for me, to be optimistic, and for the poor girl’s job I imagine. I’m still a fan of Pay-less supermarket. While she told me to grab one, surely, by her reaction, it wasn’t to see me burned. Still, as far as the ability to have a nice lawsuit for her and the store, it was also a close call.
