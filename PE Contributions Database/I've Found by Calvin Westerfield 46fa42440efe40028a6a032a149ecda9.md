**“I’ve Found…” by Calvin Westerfield**

I’ve found freedom to be purely in a neutral state, not the absence of restraint placed on one’s will, space, or time.

I’ve found prison to be an extraordinary place of learning for those that discover time is not something being done to them but a period they resolve to do something with.

I’ve found all men to be flawed and none to be perfect. Everyone makes mistakes and has bad days. The difference between a prisoner and a member of society is that the latter has never been charged, tried, and convicted for their mistakes.

I’ve found that it is only when one ceases to fight against adversity that they discover its benefit.

I’ve found competition to impede spiritual growth by catering to the ego. The celebration of winning ruins the creative mind, and the agony of defeat only breeds revenge.

I’ve found all religions must have spirituality, but spirituality does not need religion.

I’ve found the term “unconditional” to be deceitful since absolutely everything, both tangible and intangible, depends on the existence and condition of something else. Especially love.

I’ve found that trust is not earned. It must be given first in order to ascertain if the decision to do so was sound.

I’ve found racism to be a mental illness due to the fact that race is predicated on a constituency of shared genes, not hue. The only race of mankind is the human race.
