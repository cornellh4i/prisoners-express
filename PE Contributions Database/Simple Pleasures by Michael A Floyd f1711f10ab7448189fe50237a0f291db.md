**"Simple Pleasures" by Michael A. Floyd**

First off I'd like to start out by saying pleasures come in all shapes and sizes, some are edifying to mind and spirit but people make the choice at lavishing themselves with them anyway. I can't be the decision maker for the world and in most cases my ideas and what I think don't count anyway. I think the choices people make these days about the things that make "them" feel good is mostly a choice made of impulse instead of rash thinking.
I also believe through the years the things in which are called simple pleasures are entirely misrepresented and misused and given unto exaggerated emotions.
The only common pleasures of the world, now exploited by government are no longer simple. People are being accused and publicly accosted for the right in which this nation was built on. And that being free will and choice. Values this country once had have subsided and new fashions have taken over, again, the "simple pleasures" in life.
Now by all means I'm not trying to be a pessimist but a lover of things that work in faith and goodwill towards mankind. I have all ways been a believer of dreams and a supporter of maintaining positive goals and desires in my fellow man. I think that there is too much red tape and underlying pressures in dealing with creating a movement that is capable of dissolving public reverence supporting this issue.
People in this day and time really lean on not having to interact or defend themselves on what they should or shouldn't do in their spare time.
So really folks, what do we mean when we say "simple pleasures"? What does the simple part of the metaphor entail? What is so simple about a married man or woman spending an exuberant vacation in the Florida Keys with a mistress or lover while their families are left to suffer? What is so simple about a child, whose mother lets him smoke cigarettes, burns the house down falling asleep with a lit cigarette, which has again provided a simple pleasure?
A mother on AIDS benefits checks has been a prostitute most her adult life and has two little boys that have also contracted the disease, she smokes the check up not caring to feed nor clothe the two young boys.
You see when you say simple it covers a world of pain and uncertainty, some things are as simple as the examples I have just given. And mostly given in to pleasures, very sinful and misguided actions.
Now let's shed lights on the positive side of the track. Some of us love one another as much as to be an activist and make a change in the world. I'd like to see that the morals my father, through Almighty God has instilled in me give me pleasure to help and lend a hand out to my fellow man, and nor does -- the simple pleasures in my life include anything that I've listed or made mention of in this letter. I for one am a supporter of simple pleasures and the simpler the better. I have learned through my rough and bumpy road in life that what makes most men breaks most men so be careful; for what pleases many destroys most.
