**Keeping Calm by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

Should e’r I fear the rising tides

When salty wares make sport of mighty ships

And ev’ry deep abyss a monster hides

When mainsails luff and topsail canvas rips?

Or should I rather fear the mountain’s height

Or stony canyon’s steep unstable side?

Should thunder clouds give me a fright?

The Ferris wheel or roller coaster ride?

These things and many more gave me a fright

I contemplated life and death sa one;

And then you turned my darkness into light

And all I had to do I counted done.

The nighttime terrors yield to morning’s dew;

And when I die, I’ll still be loving you.
