**“Passing Me By” by Chad Frank**

My childhood was over…

In the blink of an eye.

My teen years -

Gone, in the blink of an eye.

My 35-year prison sentence,

Halfway over… in the blink of an eye.

My nephew’s grown from baby to boy…

In the blink of an eye.

“Chad, the world’s passing you by,” I tell myself.

… in the blink of an eye.
