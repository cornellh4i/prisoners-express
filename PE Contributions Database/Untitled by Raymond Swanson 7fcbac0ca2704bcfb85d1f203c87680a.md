We spent the night making love in a mountain cabin and sat down for a candlelight dinner around 6pm the night before, but the half-eaten plates are still on the table. We started outside on the open deck, overlooking a serene reservoir lake, and then we woke up this morning in front of a gorgeous fireplace before going at it again.

I walked out into the morning sunlight and heard what sounded like a man’s humming. Then I heard a deep, raspy voice. It was heard to place but sounded as if someone was meditating. I don’t know how much time had actually gone by when she came up behind me, wrapping her arms around me.

“I need to get home,” she said. “People might get curious if I get there too late.”

“Yeah okay,” I said. “I want to walk down by the water for a few moments.”	“Are you fucking serious?” she snapped.

“As a heart attack,” I said, walking down the stairs. I stopped and looked back.

“You weren’t worried about being home last night,” I said. “What difference is another hour?”

The noise only got louder as I walked through the trees. There was a small clearing, and I edged closer to the water’s edge, careful not to break a twig and disturb this man standing in thigh-deep water with arms raised toward the heavens. His humming continued for a moment, and I realized he was talking to me.

“Devils must leave now,” he yelled. “To bring someone who’s married out here to commit adultery. To subject our beautiful forests to such sin is intolerable.”

After turning around to face me, he lowered his hands and began wading toward me. I didn’t stick around. I ran as fast as I could to the cabin. The truck was ready to go because nothing was unpacked the night before.

“C’mon,” I yelled. “Let’s go!”

“Oh, now you’re ready.”

“Hurry up. I’m leaving in 8 seconds.”

I spun on the loose gravel to get back to town. As we approached pavement, I noticed an old man standing along the road. As he raised his hands, it began to rain.
