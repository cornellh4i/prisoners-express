**Oatmeal by Vicki Hicks**

Way to know, about great nourishment. It is a part of anytime, bowl of oatmeal, it’s great porridge. Oats give wonderful nourishment to the body! You would be getting lots of vitamins and nutrition. Having oatmeal for breakfast or anytime of the day makes a person run, jump, and have a hearty day.

With the grander ways that life has to offer to us, oatmeal is the best I ever had. I do oatmeal in a lot of different ways like putting sugar in it or fruits. Children and adults alike are rewarded by how fulfilling the oatmeal is for the mind and the soul.

The old saying goes like “Eat em up” and that is exactly what my grandma would say. Oh how times have changed! We need to love our bodies. To live with and understand what our body needs to be a healthy one!
