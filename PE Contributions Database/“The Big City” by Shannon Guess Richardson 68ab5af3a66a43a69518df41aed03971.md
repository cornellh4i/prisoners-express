**“The Big City” by Shannon Guess Richardson**

Curiosity is a part of human nature. Regardless of where they are from or how they live, people wonder how the other half lives. It’s where the phrase, “the grass isn’t always greener on the other side,” comes from.

I grew up in a tiny town: Flowery Branch, Georgia. When I was growing up, there was one red light, one gas station, a Post Office, and a pharmacy. Like on Cheers, everyone knew your name. It was just far enough away from Atlanta to be considered country, but close enough to not feel disconnected from the rest of the world as some small towns do.

Now, in addition to Target and many other stores, it’s where the Atlanta Falcons do their training. I remember when I had to go on a 30-minute road trip to get what I needed. Not, it’s all right there in the Flowery Branch! Hungry? Any type of food you could possibly want is right there in good ol’ Flowery Branch.

It’s funny how when I was a little girl, I wondered how it would be to live in the big city. Now, years later, my little hometown has become the big city. I can’t even tell you how it happened, or when, but it is amazing to view this big city with eyes that remember the town with one red light that most people had never heard of.
