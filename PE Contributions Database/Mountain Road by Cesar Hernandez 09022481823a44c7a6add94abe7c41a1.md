**Mountain Road by Cesar Hernandez**

Look for a tree that doesn’t have a nick or a broken branch. Or a road that doesn’t have a crack or a hole. Or a home whose foundation hasn’t shifted in a storm. Then look for a heart that hasn’t been broken by pain or love. Or a mind that hasn’t been knotted by the tensions of life. To be alive is to be radiant and broken. Living with an oen heart is the art of meeting our brokenness with our radiance.

It’s a reflex to close when we break, but the radiance that emanates from what’s been broken is what restores us. Understandably, we live in the midst of this strain: not wanting to be broken further and needing to let what’s living within us come out, once a way is revealed. For our deepest nature shows itself in the darkest times, the way stars are more visible at night.

Sooner or later, everyone is presented with an experience that will jar them to their ore. At that time, we’re faced with the coice to say yes or no to life. There is no judgment or value attached to how we arrive at yes. The path to yes might unfold through a thousand no’s. Or descend like lightning in one cataclysmic yes. What matters is our willingness to enter and taste life’s wholeness without reservation. What is opened in us is always more important than what has opened us.

When you feel you have no more to give, keep your heart open just a while longer, because this is when the deepest gift we have is about to show itself. This is the foundation of a paradox that cannot be explained: as we’re humbled over time to honor our very real limitations, the light we carr is ever more exposed through those limitations. Just when we’re at the end of what we know, the soul’s lips are ready to meet the world, while the container we can wear down and weaken, the spirit we carry is indestructable. Just as we’re feeling frai, we’re asked to trust in the inexhaustible resource that is the heart.

We all experience the dilation of acceptance and the constriction of fear. When the tonsle of the daily has us forsee how precious life is, we tend to keep what matters from what needs to be done. Somewhere in the press of our day, in the press of a conflict that we won’t let go of, in the press of a fear that makes us forsee the deeper order of things-suddenly there;s this ship and we make what matters a reward for getting to the end of trouble. Trouble never ends. It comes and goes like clouds. This is why what matters need to come first. It needs to be a constant companion. For what matters is necessary in order to endure the weather of life. Even when we forget what matters, the foundation of life waits like a faithful friend to be found in the very trouble we move through.

Under all these useless facts speeding us through all that matters, what cannot be broken down is what’s beautful and what’s left once everything is moved out of the way is what’s true. Isn’t this what time does to us? If we don’t give up or give in, we become in time beautiful and true.

Inevitably, we all lose something along the way. We each are hurt and we each do the hurting. When we can accept this fundamental truth, we’re grounded in humility and compassion. If we fight this truth or deny it, our pain and isolation only grow. So what can anyone offer but a nod and a bow to what lives in the silence under all that we feel, which we’re very close to when pried open by life. Its the radiance of life that lines our self worth.

**Submission number 2**

Often parents, as they get older, start acting like children. If your parent’s behavior is improper, like gambling, drinking, or quarreling every day, advise them gently and avoid sharp words or a stern attitude. Once, a young man says proudly, “Today, my father made a big mistake, so I chastised him fiercely.” Even if his father were wrong, what he did wasn’t appropriate. Parents are elders, so we should advise them with gentle words. If due to different perspectives your parents reject your ideas, express your reasons tactfully.

There was a child who was respectful to his elders from an earl age. His father, however,

was unfaithful to his grandfather. One day, his father abruptly put his grandfather, who was old, sick, and weak, in a basket, planning to leave him deep in the mountains to live out his final days there. He pleads with his father and kneels on the floor crying, but he can’t make his father change his mind.

Suddenly, he has an idea, wiping away the tears, he says, “You have decided to discard grandfather, and I can’t do anything about it. Can you do me a favor and please bring the basket back?”

Puzzled, the father asks, “What will you do with it?” “When you re old, I will use it to discard you,” he replies.

Alarmed, the father says, “How can you say that?”

He answers, “I am just trying to follow your example.”

Shocked into understanding, the father immediately brings the old man inside and takes very good care of him from then on.

Therefore, even if your parents are incorrect and by nature difficult to communicate with, you should gradually induce them to give up their wrong actions with skillful means and avoid using sharp words or embarrassing them. If they refuse your advice, keep asking them with respect and a sincere attitude. After repeated admonishment, wise parents will eventually accept it. If you persuade your parents gently when they are mistaken, it’s much more likely that they will change their minds. That way their honor is preserved, and your duty is fulfilled.
