**“Thankful” by Yankee Lawyer**

I’m a political prisoner in the Tabor Correctional Institution, one of the most oppressive gulags in the Dirty Dirty South. I was an attorney at law in Massachusetts in prior decades. I had land, property, gold, silver, rare coins and stamps from around the world. In North Carolina, prison guards give me one (1) roll of toilet paper a week.

I have eaten in fine restaurants and drunk some of the best wines in the world. The TCI dining experience can be very frustrating. I had a big garage and I had different vehicles for different purposes, but whether I was driving a big luxury car, a Jaguar convertible or a truck, it had to have a good stereo system and a powerful air conditioner. Now I doubt that I’ll ever charter a plan again. When my leg broke two years ago, I couldn’t even get a wheelchair.

I haven’t got time to be angry or bitter. When I began my campaign against one of North Carolina’s major industries, I knew the risks. I gave up everything I had for people who were too young and innocent to defend themselves.

The United States of America is the largest consumer of pornography in the world; and its largest producer - not Sweden, Denmark, Thailand or Iran… the U.S.A. Within the U.S.A., North Carolina is a major supplier of pictures and bodies of children.

One of the areas in which I was prominent as a lawyer was juvenile law. I defended children and families in the only modern industrialized nation-state in the world that refused to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. (That’s right. In N. Korea, Communist China, Iran, almost everywhere else, children are guaranteed due process of law; but not in the U.S.A.)

I opposed all forms of exploitation of children. To protest my three children and your’s, dear reader, I revealed names and dates in the newspapers and on TV.

Sgt. Dexter Lowe lost his job in the Burlington police department because of me, but got it back after he had me put in prison. He things he is having the last laugh.

He fails to understand two things:

1. Sexual abuse of children in no laughing matter. I didn’t derive much pleasure from attacking him; I sacrificed to make the world a better, safer place for the next generations
2. He will have to stand (actually kneel) before God and answer for his unspeakable crimes.

I don’t have much in this world; but looking towards the future I am still thankful for all I once had. I am especially thankful for Laura, Becky and Bobby.
