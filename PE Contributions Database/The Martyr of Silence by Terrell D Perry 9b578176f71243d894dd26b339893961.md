**"The Martyr of Silence" by Terrell D. Perry**

Barton, Arkansas was his next target. The people had no idea what they were in for. Neither did Andrew Yahchanon know that he would be targeted. Soon, he would find out that intense spiritual powers of the world would attempt anything to divert civilization from learning the Truth.

As Andrew passed the population sign of 3,369, his forehead dripped sweat from the 92 degree weather. His thoughts were that of a man with full knowledge as to why his new Infinity’s air condition failed, power windows were stuck up, his key broke in the door, and his spare tire caught a flat, again. “The devil is a lie. The father of them,” said Andrew, placing the car in park.

Closing the door, a sense of warning peaked within his nature. Speaking to that energy around him, Andrew said, “Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.” After taking a deep breath, Andrew proceeded forth, taking in the scene around him.

The wind blew loose dirt from the road he just pulled off from as he headed toward the grass field that served as the parking lot. Many people of the small town mingled while casually walking toward the entrance of the gigantic white tent that held the Revival Service about to take place. Over the weekend, Andrew visited every building that bore a cross symbol with the free invitation to this Revival. Those who remembered him spoke politely as Andrew passed.

Crossing into the tent, Andrew felt a bit cooler from the cold air the tent was able to hold with the jet-engine-looking air conditioners, the kinds found on sidelines of NFL games, blowing. Again, he felt the uneasy feeling intensifying as he made his way toward the two steps that led to the flat stage. “I know you’re here, haShatan, but the name Yahweh protects me. My messiah Yahshua is my strength,” said Andrew with faith.

“It’s about to start, Brother Andrew. I’ll go inform everyone to make way inside,” said Isaiah, the young volunteer whom Andrew took a liking to over the past few days.

“Thank you, brother. I’ll get ready, said Andrew.

18 minutes later, everyone sat looking at Andrew Yahchanon, waiting for his first words. Andrew stared at the gathering. It was during this time when Andrew would understand his calling and ask himself how could a successful business entrepreneur of two multimillion dollar enterprises now intensely gaze upon a crowd of no less than fifty country-living, free spirited people in a town with a population like a junior college. To Andrew Yahchanon, one word drove his real passion: Truth.

“My name is Andrew Yahchanon. Today is the first day of your Revival. Hopefully, by the seventh day of this week, the absolute Truth I’m bringing will set upon the walls of your hearts, giving birth to a yearning to live for the Heavenly Father. Yahweh is his name.” As Andrew started talking, he began pacing the ends of the flat stage overlooking the people. “To give a little history about me, I walked away from two multimillion dollar businesses I built from the ground up through hard work and perseverance, as most of you business owners can attest to. This was eight years ago. Like mostly everybody in here, I had a veil strapped around my mind’s eye. It was the fact that I wasn’t able to buy anything of satisfaction anymore that I searched for truth.”

Andrew felt the ground shake beneath his shoes. He scanned the people’s faces to see if they had felt it also. They only looked at him with hungry eyes from starved, deprived souls. That uneasy energy was greater than it had ever been. Andrew swallowed, gathered himself and pressed forward.

“Each day I will reveal a Truth about how paganistic customs that has been purposely placed within the world to not only hide our heavenly Father’s and our Savior’s true identity, but keep the veils upon our vision by the Calendar’s holding of holidays to divert our true spiritual worship of our heavenly Father. Yahweh is his name, and praise our only Messiah. Yahshua is his real name. My veil has been ripped off. So I…”

Suddenly, everything slowed to a blur. Everyone’s faces and bodies faded as Andrew noticed “it.” Directly up the aisle standing at the entrance was “it” or him or her. At the moment, “it” was all Andrew could think to name. The unnerving negative energy gerwe thick. They stared unblinkingly. Andrew prayed for strength. He never saw or felt anything like this. Not from the tyrants in his caliber business. This “it” began to walk slowly toward him with a smirk. Andrew tried to look at the people’s faces, but they all looked ahead, not seeming to notice or feel the evil presence of this being.

Dressed in a dark grayish, smoke-colored, ceremonial robe, the skin of “it” seemed to have a glowing hue. Even though the atmosphere held strong satanic vibes, the “it” walking toward Andrew was surprisingly beautiful. So beautiful that Andrew couldn’t determine if “it” was male or female. Andrew’s chest felt tight, his breathing became shallow, and he closed his eyes. As he prayed without ceasing, a stern, small voice echoed in Andrew’s mind: “I will neither leave you nor forsake you. Draw near to me, I will draw near to you. Besides me, Yahweh, there is no other.” With that, Andrew opened his eyes to see the being walking away. “It” then half-turned and gave a wink before walking into a faded image.

Blinking, Andrew’s focus came to reality. Everyone was clapping loudly, some standing. Andrew looked for “it,” not knowing why, and he wondered why people were applauding. Gathering himself, Andrew pressed on, “By the end of your Revival, you will cease celebrating paganized customs purposely placed in religion to keep us from the righteous worship of Yahweh. Starting today with why our Father’s name Yahweh was intentionally removed from all scriptures over 7,000 times…”
