**"Holidays" by Norris Beebe**

Right at that moment, I took a glance around the compartment. I saw he was on his rack with his eyes closed. They all were, you could really see the pain in his eyes. In everyone’s face. Do I look like them? I thought to myself. Do I show the same features on my face as they do? Were they all asleep or just meditating on why or how all of us did not want to be there? Or were they all thinking the same as I felt? … Wanting to be home before the holidays were over?

We had no choice. We were all stuck here at this particular time and place. Within our own hearts, we all knew we put ourselves in this situation, with no one else to blame. Then everyone around you wants to understand “why”. All you can say is pride and patriotism was a factor…

Our population held people from numerous regions of the US. Having two bunkies, it was a rare occasion that you were all three on the racks at the same time. It was also rare that you would have a bunkie from your hometown. I feel lucky as we all get along pretty well coming from different cities and states. We work in the same department and at different times. As we lay there in thought, I slowly drift into another world.

Early morning came silently. A cool breeze crept its breath across the east coast shoreline. Without a farewell or a wave goodbye. The sky was still covered with a midnight blue with dawn searching for the horizon.

Signs of movement became reality when its puissant diesel engines powered up and began to roar to life. We all could feel their vibrations through the surrounding steel. Being set to idle, they began to produce their own power filtering out an outside artificial power supply.

Reality slaps you in the face when the steel door is slammed shut, sealed, and locked behind you with a heavy thud, becoming water tight. With every moment spent, a fading slam, crunch, and thud thunder in the distance.

With a gloomy start, it became a routine workday. Over the intercom system raged a whistle then an echo … Reveille, Reveille… All hands on deck, waking all of its occupants.

Our mindset had changed the channels from a lifestyle of common life to the station where a man is constantly under pressure and strain, lacking sleep. Restationing a mindset is a must under these type of circumstances to survive the environment and its demands.

Breakfast would be served soon, but even then… I’m sure none of us were looking forward to hot provisions, let alone getting out of the rack.

The first day being gone was always the worst. Depression along with its mood swings became the biggest hardship to overcome and caused most of the conflicts among the crew. Though it didn’t take long before you were conditioned to the program which demanded you to pay attention to detail.

Work transformed into an asset for the mind to free itself from its own characteristics. When you are at hand, on deck, you could enjoy the beauty of the sunrise of sunset, blending stunning colors as the van’s features its light that shows a new day’s triumph or to fade away into the darkness. Either way, the sunlight would be filtered upon us, lighting our way into oblivion. Whether it be day or night, you could see every gleam, every cluster, every star. You could land all there was to see for there was no artificial blindness.

As you look upon the different challenges we all experience throughout our lifetimes, you could really see how powerful our Creator really is. What a mighty designer He can be. Then all beauty comes to an end…

Ten days later, a loud whistle came across the intercom following a shouting roar…

General Quarters… General Quarters… All hands, manned your battle stations. Within seconds, every man was up, dressed and running to their battle station as if we were at war…

I was stationed on the U.S.S. NASSAU LHA-4 from 1986 to late 1990. It was 1989 when our orders were to head to the coast of Iran and assist the rescue of the 109 American hostages as well as to serve and protect the freedom of the people foreign and domestic. We were part of the 6th fleet. Being an amphibious aircraft carrier holding 3800 Navy and Marine personnel, we manned our battle stations approaching off the coast of Iraq awaiting our orders.

My General Quarters station was manning of the 6” guns. Shells and powder by the pallets were railed to the weapon stations while helicopters and our A9slF22 harriers held their weight in flight. We were all waiting for something to happen.

Anxious to jump and fight our battle, waving strong our stars and stripes, we shipped off a battalion of marines to recon a populated area in Iran where the hostages were said to be held by Iraqi terrorists.

So we wait on guard, ready to attack, backing our troops by air, sea and ground.

The American hostages were rescued without a flaw during this highly televised campaign. Our troops went in, reconed and overcame hostile resistance without firing a shot. Only minor injuries were sustained with no major casualties, military or civilian. One happy ending to a long voyage.

It was a quick return as we entered our home port after engaging in three more months of ongoing adventure the United States Navy promised its enlisted. Our holidays were over, lost out to sea, but we made due. Duty to our country always came first as a soldier.

Finally we pulled into our port and tied up to the dock, I found, when I stepped off of the ship and into my home in Virginia Beach, Virginia, the best surprise one could ever imagine. My children chose to wait for their daddy to celebrate the day Jesus was born.

Together.

What a proud moment for God, the United States Navy and myself as a father. What a beautiful gift from God. The best Christmas gift one could ever receive.
