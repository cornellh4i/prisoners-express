**“My Parents” by John Naylor**

****This seems to be a touchy subject to write about in prison. I’ve heard so many tragic and sad stories of foster care, abuse, and broken homes. May god comfort the sadness and convert the negativity into a positive force to better this world. We build strength within ourselves to survive; some just get a head start from a parent or guardian.

I was blessed to have a mother and father. They’re still together too. Growing up, my father was different from my mother in every way. He’s closed-mouth with a type-A personality. He was a drag racer, a hockey player, a metal worker, welder, hunter, fisherman, electrician, jack-of-all-trades guy. My mother is a Christian homemaker. She likes to take care of the house please god. She was at Indiana University studying to become a nurse when she became legally blind as a result of a condition called histoplasmosis. My dad was a history worker at Airfoil Textron and later Chrysler. He worked at a variety of jobs. That was before my time though.

We had family vacations, weekends fishing, prospecting for god, flea marketing and bargain-hunting. Frugal and country was our lifestyle. They homeschooled my brother, Andy, and me. Because of how we lived, we learned things schools don’t teach. We explored the country and made friends on our travels.

We both got our G.E.D. and went to college. My brother stayed out of prison and graduated. My life wasn’t as perfect. It was far from the tragedy of some poor souls.

I’m grateful that I have parents and that they’re still around to take care of each other. Being well-adjusted makes people think you’re weird in prison, so I’m different from most. But I’m grateful for it, grateful that I’m a free thinker. It frees me from the bars and the brainwashing perspectives of mainstream society.
