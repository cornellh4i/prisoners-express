**“Oh Shep” by Phillip L. Rath**

When I was a howry boy, I had a companion

That was like my right arm. Shep was always around, like my shadow, but lots more fun and amusing. Over the years, Shep watched me learn to play basketball, ride bicycles, and fish. Shep was always attentive and non-judgemental. Shep’s greatest tricks were to drink water using only his tongue and peeing on every tree and griebling we passed on our adventures. Playing dead, fetching and general canine ahedronel training were below the dignity of my faithful companion.

I never noticed Shep growing old, perhaps because I learned to drive a car and become interested in girls. I awoke one day and Shep just wasn’t there anymore.

I’ve had other dogs as an adult, father, and grandfather. None have been allowed into my heart as Shep was.

Now I’m on the last few miles of my journey and I long for those days I shared with Shep and I wonder if O’Shep will be waiting for me on the other side of the veil as I pass out of this existence, and if will he forgive my abandonment when he travelled those last miles of his journey.
