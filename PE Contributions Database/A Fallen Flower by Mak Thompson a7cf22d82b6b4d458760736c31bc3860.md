**A Fallen Flower by Mak Thompson**

Stagnate scenes wasted dreams

breaking at the seams

echos of the past coming back fast

Happiness doesn’t seem to last

Calamity conforms as my smile quickly deforms

Once again, I’m torn

Lost, lonely, and destined to fall

To damn young to want to end it all

Had a rough childhood

Had to grow up too quickly

But all it took was one needle prick

To gain a habit and regress

I have no faith in lucky charms

I carve my pain into my arms

This disruptive static fills my head

Maybe I’d be better off dead

More than a pretty face on this endless dope chase

Its reality I am trying to escape

So I poke another hole

I smoke another bowl

I tear another piece of my soul

It’s like I am a fallen flower

I am tattered up and shattered

It’s like I am a dark princess locked away in some far away tower

Insane with loneliness

My heart is homeless

Hidden in a shadow

By a darkened dungeon

That no one knows

You discovered my hidden face

Glimpsed my soul

And ran like all other to another

Again my shadows and I are alone

Staggering about numb

Breaking all the mirrors

As not to see

What I have become

All that remains is a memory

A flower for my heartless soul
