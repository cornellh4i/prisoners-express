**“Frustrated, but not defeated.” by Dillon James Gresham**

Does a frustrated man always have to be defeated? Of course not. Only a weak mind would think such a weak thought. To accept defeat is to let the other side win. Just because something frustrates you, doesn’t mean you should “give-in”. Your morals will always be yours, your achievements will always be yours, your sweat and hard work will always be from you. Why give that to somebody else? Why allow them that satisfaction. If you must die, why not die with a fight, go down swinging. Because it frustrates or hurts you? What kinda excuse is that? In all things there is a possibility of a different outcome. The wheels of fate can change for the better to those who try. In life it’s never worth being destroyed. If you stop fighting, does that in any way help you once the damage is done? If you’re already at the bottom, what do you lose by heading toward the top? A good friend of mine in solidarity who was facing the death penalty along with me once said to me, “D.J., we’re at the bottom of the barrel, the only way left to go is up. It’s pointless to give up until it’s impossible to continue on.” I asked, “Well, how do we know it’s impossible to continue on?” and his answer was “Because we won’t be here no more, we’ll be in heaven or hell, whatever is in store.” That man’s name was Kelvin Coleman. See, I was at a point where I didn’t know if it was all over, if I’d completely lost. But he taught me that if I had completely lost, I wouldn’t be here anymore. So for the simple fact that I can breathe, and wake up every morning, that shows I’m not defeated. He gave me the motivation and strength I needed to continue swimming and fighting for my freedom. He showed me that no matter how frustrated a situation makes me or how many times it occurs, that frustration is NOT defeated. Success is only gained by picking up from your failures and moving forward. Never stop fighting, and never give up!
