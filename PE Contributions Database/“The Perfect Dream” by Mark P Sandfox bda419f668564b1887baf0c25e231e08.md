**“The Perfect Dream” by Mark P. Sandfox**

Once upon a time, on a foggy day, back in the days of two cent bubblegum, the railroad tracks disappeared into a murky bank a few blocks away. Peter, no one called him Peter but his mom and dad, was twelve, lanky and awkward, long blonde hair hiding his too big for his head ears, sky blue eyes atop a too big for his face nose, but he had a smile that could melt icicles. 1974, bell-bottom jeans and white t-shirts were the attire of the day for most boys, what brand of sneakers you wore was completely irrelevant,

Trees and scrub left and right, it was just Barefoot Sally and Pete walking hand in hand down the railroad tracks. Pete would love to tell you they were a couple, would love to tell the whole world they were a couple, but they were just friends. Barefoot Sally walked atop the rain in a pair of shorts that were way too short and a crop top that riveted Pete’s eyes to her exposed midriff. Most of the kids at school, especially the bullies, teased Sally for being poor, Pete loved her for being rich. Sally needed no money in Pete’s presence, everything he had he shared freely with Sally. Green eyes, freckled skin, frizzy fiery hair, she was beautiful, but she was so much more. She fished with him, swam faster than most boys, they chased critters together, played in the mud, wrestled when they were bored, she even helped Pete with his homework. She was amazing, but she was just his friend.

One bare foot in front of the other, Barefoot Sally walked the rail, dancing like a ballerina, Pete’s hand her balance and guide.

A horn blared from deep within the fog.

“Train!” blurted Pete.

Barefoot Sally giggled.

Pete dug into his pocket with his free hand for his last two pennies. One for her, one for him. He would get twenty-five more next week for taking out the garbage and bagging the lawn clippings. He would spend all that on Barefoot Sally as well, bubblegum and sweets.

“Stay still,” smiled Pete.

With great apprehension, Pete released her hand. Barefoot Sally was a daredevil, had them jump off a bridge once, all because she saw it in a movie. Pete watched her, lost himself in her green eyes, but her eyes were elsewhere, fixed, staring down the tracks. PEte kneeled, placed both pennies on the rail, mere inches in front of her bare feet.

The horn wailed again, much closer now, a glint of its headlight piercing the fog...really close.

Barefoot Sally squeaked. Pete jumped to his feet. Sally reached out her hands, fingers wiggling him closer. She was stranded on the rail. Pete had carried her over the jagged rocks earlier that morning, piggyback style.

“Hurry,” she begged and squirmed.

Pete smiled, carrying Barefoot Sally was the highlight of any day. Before Pete could turn around to give her his back, Barefoot Sally squeaked again then launched herself airborne. It was all Pete could do to hold his ground, her arms and legs spread wide, she flew through the air into his arms, bare legs wrapping instantly around his waist. This was new. Her arms wrapped around his neck as she tucked her face into his long blonde hair, like a strawberry vanilla swirl.

“Hurry,” she shivered, her breath upon his ear igniting shivers of their own.

Pete looked up. The locomotive broke free of the fog, a big old diesel, brown and rusty, angry and huffing. It blew its horn again, more angry, more urgent. The ground began to rattle, it was time to run. It was like carrying an overgrown child but Pete managed to run them off the tracks, down the embankment, and into a bush before the train was upon them. Pete spun around back towards the tracks then carefully lay down in the bush, Barefoot Sally beneath him. There was no reason to give the caboose easy targets for their pepper guns.

Barefoot Sally leaned her head back to watch the passing train. Pete’s eyes were glued to her freckled long neck. Her body was mashed to his, she had not unwound her legs or arms. A breeze from the passing train wafted both of their hair, puffing at their faces, creating a little slice of heaven. Pete tingled from head to toe.

It was now or never. He had tried before but his timing was never just right. Green eyes left the train. Blue eyes never left her face. Green on blue, blue on green, they leaned, they met, they kissed. Shots fired! Not the pepper guns, it was fireworks bursting inside Pete’s mind. Soft, gentle, moist, tender, everything he thought it would be, and so much more. Their lips parted, their tongues met, what he thought would be heaven was only the matinee.
