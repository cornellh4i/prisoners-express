**The World Awaits by Scott Madoulet**

I pause at the threshold, looking out into the world. Why do I hesitate? Why am I so afraid?

The skull carved into the rock to my left is a warning to all those who would leave this darkness. The rock and the dark make this place confining, but it's comfortable too. It’s safe in here with no temptations, no distractions, no one else to complicate things. I’ve learned to like the dark and the quiet, the hard floor, the hard walls, the hard bunk. Just me and my thoughts, alone with all the others here; we are all alone.

It feels like I’m gazing up at the world from the bottom of a grave. Because here, in the dark, I’m dead to the world. And sadly, I’m okay with it. We are the true walking dead. Forgotten, or seldom remembered, we trudge through our isolated lives in the dark and the rock. An occasional stray beam of light may deliver a letter or a package, momentarily remembered, but soon the soothing darkness settles in, comforts again.

The owners of the rock which cradles me, they have told me it's time to leave. But, I don't want to go! I’m afraid of going into the world. It was so, so hard to get adjusted to the dark and to the rock - the first time - if I fuck up, if I make a mistake … I don’t think I could face it again.

So I pause, one foot on the threshold looking into myself, checking to see if I’ve earned it, if I’m ready, if I’m worthy to try LIFE again.
