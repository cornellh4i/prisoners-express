**Running by James Stevahn**

There is more than one type of running. First you have running as in a race. Next there's running a company. Both can be good. However, the running I think of isn’t physical nor related to a business. I’m talking about the running I seem to be a pro at, running from.

I used to be running away from responsibility, myself and reality. Yes, I’d show up to work everyday and pay my bills. Those were public responsibilities. It’s the personal, hidden ones that I was good at.

I never accepted responsibility for my actions, broken relationships - friend or intimate. Why let anyone get close? They’ll only be disappointed and leave. If I own up to my actions that meant I was broken. I was running from myself which is the dumbest thing ever. It’s not like I could hide from myself. Not that it hadn’t stopped me from trying. I’ve been running from myself and my actions for so long I’ve run into a stranger in my own body. It’s been a long road so far to try and figure out who this person is. This self discovery journey is far from over. I take each step reluctantly. What if I figure me out and don’t like myself? I can’t simply run away.

I’ve run from reality. I found an alternative life online. Without the physical face to face, I could be anybody I wanted to. Who would really know one way or another. I spent most of my free time on the WWW.

All of this running away and looking over my shoulder cursed me to run right into bipolar depression. It’s harder to figure life out and myself when I can’t trust my own emotions and experiences, which are true and which aren’t.

Lately, I’ve been doing some different running. I’ve been running to God. I now realize that if I’m tired of running away He’s right there to pick me up and carry me if necessary in the right direction. This is the best kind of running.
