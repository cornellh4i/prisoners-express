**“‘Til Death Do Us Part” by Curtis Colvin**

This is a picture of my twin girls. No, I have no pictures of their faces. I don’t want anyone to see how beautiful they really are. You see, I’m a billionaire living on my island. My wife had twins but died giving birth. The midwife I hired stayed on to raise them. I allow no one to come onto my island. I have all my supplies shipped by air or sea. I pay good money for that. I also have my own security patrol in the waters surrounding my little island. They have a dockside warehouse on the mainland for a staging point.

Why, you ask? Reason being is that I don’t want my girls to grow up in a terrible, hazardous world. I make them rely on each other or myself. I allow no internet or television or phone. The only phone is locked up in my vault. I buy certain movies (pre-reviewed by me) for them to watch. I’m their teacher and instructor. The midwife cooks, cleans, and sends her money overseas to her family. She is also my mistress.

Why am I showing this picture to you? Well I did some research and checked your family tree. I know you are about to graduate from Cornell University. Your G.P.A. is excellent. Your family died in a horrendous plane crash. You, my man, are a perfect specimen in health and stamina. Here is my question… Would you marry my daughters? Both of them. And live out your life on my island? You would not have to work another day in your life. I would give you $100,000 a year to help you and my girls. But once you step foot on my island, you cannot change your mind or leave.

Yes, I know you are still a virgin. That’s one of the reasons I chose you. Plus, the fact that I knew your father years before the crash. He was a good friend.

So, what do you say young man? Marry two beautiful women, make lots of money, never have to worry about food or shelter again, and maybe inherit my fortune when I die. Life could be worse. Well, yes or no?
