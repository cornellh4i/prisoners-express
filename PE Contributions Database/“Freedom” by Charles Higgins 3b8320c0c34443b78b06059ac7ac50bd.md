**“Freedom” by Charles Higgins**

Arguments can be draining, harassing, and annoying all at the same time. Just as well sometimes those very same arguments can be harmful, dangerous, or even deadly at times, no matter where you are. Especially if you find yourself adverse to someone with a small mind that can not escape the boundaries that they limit themselves with.

How so? Impatience maybe. Derogatory remarks. Close minded apprehension. Whatever the case may be, the glass remains half empty, things are always half done, and nothing ever works out. Self limitations that constantly sound like a concoction for the old adage of “misery loves company.” If they’re miserable, why not make you miserable too.

I used to argue a lot as well, I’m no different than anyone else. Mostly over sports, but anything that I felt I was right on, even if there was no valid way to prove it right then and there. Then, I read something in a book that I have carried with me ever since, and have utilized regularly. I am grateful for it. I’ll share it with you, because it may help you as much as it has helped me.

“Do you want to be right, or do you want to be free?” What a great question to ponder. Free how? Free of the hassle? Free of the stress? Free of the angst? Free of any misunderstandings? Free of the negative vibes posed by those who are just itching to argue? Freedom from shackles of bondage that have too often held most of us back! I wasn’t aware that a prison of the mind even existed.

But what about them being proved wrong, so they can know they’re walking afoul of themselves and learn better? What does it matter? Be free of their ego as well as your own. It took me a little longer after I read that to realize that people’s choices are their own. Right or wrong. Now I choose freedom over being right or the bondage of ignorance. If they’re wrong, that is their bondage… not mine. And if they’re right, so what? It doesn’t matter because I’m free.
