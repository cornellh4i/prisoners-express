**Lot Lizards by Curtis Colvin**

Yep! That’s Jodi and Peggy right there. Picked them up at the “Flying J” truckstop outside of Orange, TX. Said that they wanted to ride with me in my freightline to another truck stop in Louisiana. What else was I supposed to say, no? So I said “Climb on in.”

Within the first 5 miles, Peggy let me know the cost of the “ride” with her and Jodi. Pretty cheap since I was giving them a ride. But I had just gotten married and did not want to cheat on my wife, (but I knew it was going to happen sooner or later). So they told me their story about riding along with truckers, having fun in the sleepings, and then jumping “ship” to another truck to another destination.

I dropped them off in Slidell, LA at the 66 truck stop. Never seen them again until you showed me their picture. So Mr. Department of Health man, you said that these two have been passing along what kind of disease? Well, I’m just happy as rain that I didn’t dip my stick in those lot lizards!
