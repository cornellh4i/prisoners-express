**Silence is Invisible by Jeremy Brown**

What you see is only a fraction of what actually exists.

Using Clairvoyance we can see our future timelines.

The Ultimate Reality within you is expansive.

Telepathic communication with your Highest Self is factual.

Open and Tune into your Sixth Sense to Realize this new perception.

Possible Futures may be realized beyond the here and Now, Awaken your powers of Infinite Creation  and Visualization by applying and practicing simple mediation.

You are infinite, infinite Immortal Soul, you never die, only change forms!

This process therefore will help you with decision making, watching, thoughts, come, go!

When your Third Eye opens you begin to reach your frequency!

Beyond this limited time and place, lies Infinite Quanta of Space!

This world is left without a trace. Accelerate your mental pace. Stay awake, make haste. Soul liberation is right in front of your face. Nothing is truly what it seems, you can feel things in your imagination. Extraordinary Experiences lie within ordinary mementas.

Factuality, Truth, Answers all rest in your own Invisible Silence. Silence the voice of your mind, Momentos Necessario Un Absolute Silenco. Spiritual Transfiguration, your perfection is complete. Now levitate your consciousness. Are you living or Dreaming to live? Have you ever had that feeling where you’re not sure if you’re Awake or are still dreaming? Awaken through One pointed concentration. This is your Activation.

Practice Applied Meditation! O’ what a delightful Mental True Sensation.
