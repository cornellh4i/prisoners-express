**Gratitude by Yankee Lawyer**

When writing about an ethical or moral value, one should start with the Bible. What does God say about it? I looked up “gratitude” in the concordance in the back of my Bible. No entry. There are numerous verses listed under words such as “forgive,” “forget,” and “mercy.” Shorter lists appear under “vengeance” and “revenge,” a longer list under “hate.”

As often happens, the Scripture seems to hold a curious emphasis on negativity and evil. The Bible reads like a training manual for an oppressed person seeking to be a more perfect victim. If I owe someone, I should pay. If someone owes me, I should forgive. This sounds like a very self-defeating economic theory.

Still, I am grateful to my Creator, my parents, my high school biology teacher, my college history teacher, and to other people too numerous to mention. Except for God, of course, these people all had parents and teachers. Should I be grateful to them too? Where does gratitude end?

What about our armed forces? Should I be grateful to the brave men and women blowing up schools and hospitals around the world for me? Should I express my undying gratitude to those who sacked, plundered, looted and raped whole villages in Vietnam?

I am somehow unable to feel gratitude toward the men who swear “to serve and protect” me, then strangle black men and shoot unarmed black children. Yet God tells us to love our neighbors and even our enemies. I reckon it all somehow comes down to gratitude toward Him who created us, and all that is good in the world.
