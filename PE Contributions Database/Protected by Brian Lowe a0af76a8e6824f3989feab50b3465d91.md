**“Protected” by Brian Lowe**

When I think of the word “Protected” many things come to mind. The first half dozen or so are negative and only in use within the prison culture/linguistics, so I automatically dismiss them. What then comes to mind still isn’t so good. I have no early memories of being sheltered, watched over, or protected to draw upon. I was raised like a wild animal, mom crazy and imposing it on us while she was around, and dad was gone, in the truck, for long periods of time. He got one of his wives, or girlfriends, or paid-for babysitters to “care” for us but it never lasted for more than a few days.

This wouldn’t have been such a large problem, except that my dad would be gone a month or more at a time, then come home for a weekend, then back on the road again. So we were left alone most of the time. “We” being my sister and me. This upbringing, or lack thereof, contributed heavily to our present circumstances. However, she is morally far worse in every way than I could ever be, even if I trained for it, without a doubt, hands down.

The main difference is that she is a better liar and manipulator than me, *way better.* Otherwise, I would have never gone to prison in the first place. This is how I think of “Protected”. My sister was protected by my dad because he felt swayed by her lies and manipulations. The most horrible thing about this is that he’s still a victim to her lies and manipulations to this day. Is this the way to treat an elderly, disabled veteran, especially one that is your own father? No, it is wrong, and more so because he has dementia, thus easy prey to her predatory tactics.

Another sad thing is that I see her perpetuating this false protection by raising her own children this way as well. The girls cannot do any wrong and get whatever they want, while the boys are neglected and punished for anything. It sickens me that she mistreats her own sons and trains her daughters to be clones of her. And she wonders why I despise her. She is so caught up in her own web of lies that she believes them and allows them to be perpetuated to her own children, even when she knows it is wrong, she does so anyways. She is at the point where anything she says is the gospel truth and if you do not agree with her then you are wrong, no matter what, regardless of the facts and evidence.

From my observations of society in general, this rampant immorality in the disguise of the common good, or religion, or (insert cause here), has become the new norm. Moral decay and depravity are now “protected” by law and being openly spread, some even with government help. From my point of view, “protected” is not a good thing. Maybe it will someday mean something good to me, but for now, I cannot say.
