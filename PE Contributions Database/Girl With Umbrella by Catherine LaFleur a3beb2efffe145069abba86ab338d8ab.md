**by Catherine LaFleur**

This is how the story of two people beings:

He was using the vacuum when the phone rang.

She was on the other end, I’m coming to get my things.

I’ll be there, he answered in a clipped tone.

It was late afternoon, and the sky was the color of winter drizzle leaking down onto everything.

He was in the living room, cleaning up remnants of their last argument. Glass tinkled as he picked out photos from the shattered frames.

Don’t you care that I’m leaving you, she cried. Don’t you care about anything?

He kept picking things up, a fallen lamp, scattered magazines, the cushions from the upended sofa.

You bastard. I hope I never see you again. Tears streaked down her cheeks in silvery lines.

She bent and picked up one of Baby’s plush toys. It squeaked cheerily.

He turned towards her. She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand then whirled and rushed toward the kitchen.

Give me that, he demanded.

I’m just going to get my things then I’m leaving, she called back.

He didn’t answer. He followed her through the door.

She stood behind the granite counter cradling Baby to her chest.

Give her to me, he said.

You must be insane.

No, but you aren’t taking Baby. He mentioned to the carrier decorated with Disney character decals and the oversized pink bag on the counter. Just leave all her things here.

You aren’t getting my Baby, she said.

Baby had begun to make soft distressed noises.

Look, she said, you’re upsetting her.

He moved closer.

Stay away from me, asshole! She shrieked. She reached for the handle of the knife protruding from a wooden block.

Put Baby down.

Just leave us alone.

She turned away hitching Baby up her shoulder. But he came around the counter too fast. He reached across her and grasped Baby’s leg loosely in his hand.

Let go of her, he said.

Get the fuck away from me! She screamed.

Baby began to whimper then cry. During the shoving match, Baby kicked frantically. Baby’s bag was knocked over scattering toys, food, and supplies across the slate floor.

He held her against pantry door trying to wrest Baby out of her arms. He held onto Baby’s legs with grim determination.

Let go of her, he said.

Don’t, she pleaded. Can’t you see you’re scaring her?

Baby continued to snuffle and cry.

I’m not scaring her.

Well, you’re hurting her.

I’m not hurting Baby, he insisted.

The lights flickered with the sudden clap of thunder that rattled the night darkened panes of the french doors. He worked her fisted fingers from Baby’s sweater with one hand, and with the other hand, he lifted Baby up under the shoulder. Baby screamed a high pitched cry.

She felt her fingers losing purchase and slowly being forced open one by one.

She felt Baby being taken from her.

No! she yelled as Baby slid loose.

She would keep her. Baby was hers.

She reached again for Baby. She caught Baby’s head and leaned back.

Baby shrieked in pain.

But he wouldn’t let go.

He felt Baby leaving his arms, and he pulled back hard.

Then there was abrupt silence.

This is how the story of two people ends.
