**The Value of Life by Rolf Rathmann**

There’s an old Visa commercial (or perhaps MasterCard?) that goes something like this: bouquet of roses? $32.00. An evening on the town? $110.00. The smile on her face when you propose? Priceless. Aside from the fact the marketing campaign cannot be that great if I can’t even remember the company, the advert brings to mind my own darker version.

I’m sitting in a classroom setting in a treatment facility, and the project for the day is to place a monetary value on all the harm I’ve done. WTF?! Where to begin?

It actually proved easier than I imagined: lawyer -10K, bond - 5K, trial - 35K, incarceration - $40 a day, unpaid credit cards/hospital/loans/utilities - 50K, money on my books for canteen and phone - $300 a month, loss of future wages - 700K. The total staggers just shy of one million dollars.

What did I not include? All the dough I spent on drugs, alcohol, and sex.

Debt

And how does one even place a dollar amount on the losses attached to shame, degradation, hopelessness, depression, and suicidal ideation and attempts.

Debt piled upon debt.

Lost, wasted, or stolen moments? The behaviors I engaged in when I didn’t have cash or open credit limits, but still wanted to get high.

What is, afterall, the value of a life?

My life?

Sitting here in prison, I wanted to go through the metaphorical drawers, looking for all the old bills needing attention. I aligned myself with someone to help me examine my faults, me defects of character, as it were. Of course, so as not to stay stuck, my assets were also going into the mix, allowing a more full, richer version of myself to appear.

Simply put, I would unburden myself of all that held me back, those dark recesses which I had always been too afraid to deal with. At the same time, I would then need, (and as of now), want, to make amends for my harms - in other words, pay off my debts.

Surprisingly, I’m excited, down-right eager in fact, about this process. I’m reminded to slow down. Admittingly, I’m a little nervous too. I’ve started with the easier ones. Perhaps they’re those I deemed the hurt cut less deeply? Maybe I didn’t know them as intimately?

Key to this step is working with a person who has already been through this process. For you see, at my core, one of my character defects is manipulation. So the person I work with can see through the bull. Left to my own devices, I will paint myself as the subject of a far prettier picture than reality has painted; explain myself away or avoid responsibility. Essentially, the antithesis of making amends.

A friend once compared this to selling your house. You clean and swab every crevice, rip off layers of wallpaper, replace floorboards now creaking, and spackle and paint. Voila, the same house, but refreshed, ready for a new story to take place.

As I write my amends letter, I pass it before a trusted mentor, who in turn might make suggestions. I’m told that my honesty is keeping him honest. I trust that this is so.

Usually, he’ll tell me to get to the point. Cut the crap. Eliminate one sentence, or paragraph.

I’ve done two of these so far. The road in front of me is a long one. I sit in fear and worry. How will the recipient respond? Will they ever speak to me again? Am I creating more harm? Will this be worth it? How will I feel when all is said and done? But then, my trusted friend gently chides: this is a process. A journey. Stop trying to control things. Lastly - “Let Go and Let God.” That’s the hardest part for me.

When I look at my life, my best efforts got me where I am now, so maybe I should try this “letting go” thing. Therein lies true power: being able to shed decades of grime which I’ve long defined myself by. As I grow, perhaps I can move forward into a life well-lived. The debt of my wrongs no longer hang around my neck like the proverbial albatross.
