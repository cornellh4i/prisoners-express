Grandparents by Jeremy Seth Dunlap

There’s a country song by James Johnson named “In Color.” It’s about a kid looking at black-and-white pictures of his grandfather as his grandfather explains what was going on at that time in his life. He tells him of how he grew up on a farm during the Great Depression, fought in WWII, and finally got married. Throughout, the grandfather keeps saying, “You should’ve seen it in color,”

That song reminds me of my granddad on my dad’s side of the family. Deadrick Leroy Dunlap grew up on a farm in the eastern Tennessee mountains during the Great Depression, fought in the second infantry wave in Normandy during WWII, and once home from the war, married my grandmother, Wanda Kiker, and went back to dairy farming.

Of all the humorous stories I’ve been told by my dad and uncles, I’ve been trying to think of one that really captures grandad, because he was a good, but also hard man. My brother and I only knew joy and love from him as he taught us how to ride and care for horses. He also taught me how to whittle wood and gave me my first pocket knife. Yet I knew he was tough on dad when he was growing up. Then I settled on something dad told me.

Granddad played quarterback for his high school team, and according to dad and my uncle Dale, he had an incredible arm. He was so good that he once nailed my uncle Dale in the back of the dead with a dirt clod through trees from at least 80 yards away as Dale was running up the hill that lead to their house from the main field. Pretty impressive.

One time dad was talking to him about football and granddad just kind of shrugged and said, “I really don’t care much about football.”

Dad took this in for a second and then asked, “But dad, didn’t you play football in high school?”

“Yep,” replied granddad.

“Well if you didn’t like it why did you play?” Dad told me granddad thought about it for a second and then said, “We needed twelve people to have a team and my friends really wanted to play. If I hadn’t decided to play, we couldn’t have had a team, and I wanted to help my friends.”

That stuck with me. Still sticks. He played years of a sport he didn’t like, not for himself, but for his friends. He considered others as more important than himself. He fought in a war because it was his duty, and he fought for his friends beyond some patriotic ideal. Love, Honor, Duty. Those three things were important to him. In that, he exemplified his generation.

Sure, he was human and had his flaws, but he always sought to do the right thing. He died while I’ve been in. He was 85 and lived a full life. I miss him dearly, and wish we had more time. Still, I’ll never forget what he taught me by simply being himself.
