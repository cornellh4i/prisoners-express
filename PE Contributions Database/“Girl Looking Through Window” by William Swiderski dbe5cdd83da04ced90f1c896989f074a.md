**“Girl Looking Through Window” by William Swiderski**

When I see this picture I think of my daughter whom I haven’t heard from in quite a while. When she was writing and we were in touch, she told me she would often just sit and think back to the times we shared together, which I often do myself. I like to think that at times, even though we are not in touch, she still does that and sometimes when I’m really hurting and thinking of her or other family and friends, I like the idea that maybe at that exact moment wherever they are they might be sitting and thinking of me, too.

That type of connection keeps me going during the hard lonely times and I think the memories are some of the most important things we have and the things maybe we should treasure the most.
