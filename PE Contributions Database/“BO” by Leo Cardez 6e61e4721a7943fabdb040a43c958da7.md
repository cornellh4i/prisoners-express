**“BO” by Leo Cardez**

Not all dogs go to heaven. Some dogs are just born bad. Remember Cujo? Bo was like that.

Bo was a rescue. A big ball of fur, half St. Bernard--half demon. The previous owners reportedly couldn't keep a dog his size at their apartment, but I know the truth: they were scared. Unfortunately, he suckered my wife with his big doe brown eyes. Bo's our dog, I just feel it, she said. So be it.

Bo sexually assaulted every leg within reach. The vet said fixing him would help. It only worked to anger him and escalate to physical assault. We stopped getting mail. Eventually, the police tried to get involved. He bit them too. Animal control tried to tase him, but that was like trying to put a band-aid on a bullet wound. At adulthood he was 6 feet, nose to tail, and weighed in at a muscled 210 pounds of crazy. Sometimes, I'd be in the office working when I'd sense evil and sure enough he would be standing at the doorway just looking at me. I'd tell him to beat it, he wouldn't move an inch, just let out a low guttural growl that sounded like hate personified. I was afraid to fall asleep in my own house.

In the summer Bo turned 4 we all went on a picnic to Garfield Park. The park had a conservatory my wife enjoyed and a water fountain Bo used as his personal lap pool. And then all hell broke loose and our lives would be changed forever.

For lack of a better word, they were hoodlums. A group of young men looking for trouble -- when they met Bo, they found it. He chased them off so quickly I barely had time to react. But, they returned. With a gun.

Pop, Pop, Pop, Bo let out a high pitched yelp and I felt something hot poke my leg. Bo had lunged at the attacker as I dove over Andrea. All but one of the bullets missed.

That one tiny piece of metal went clear through Bo's cheek, ricocheted off my left calf and pierced Andrea's heart. The Doctor told me she didn't suffer and there was nothing left to be done.

Bo was in denial and inconsolable. He refused to leave the front door waiting for Andrea to return. He wouldn't eat or go on walks. He stopped biting and rarely barked anymore. It's as if he had lost his will to exist. I know how he felt. Her loss had left a void so big it seemed we would never be able to cross it.

That Christmas I received a package, seemingly from beyond the grave. It was a picture of Bo and I with an inscription on the back: To my boys. Yesterday. Today. And Tomorrow. She had ordered it and scheduled its delivery before the accident. It was more than I could bear.

I didn't cry when it happened. I didn't cry at the hospital. Not even at her funeral when I carried her on my shoulder. But this, this was too much. I broke down and then I broke the dishes. I stormed around the house demanding answers from God. When I saw Bo, I yelled at him too. I blamed him for not saving her. It should have been you, I shouted. It should have been me, I whimpered. I found the whiskey in the cupboard and looked for answers at the bottom of the bottle.

The next morning I woke up to find myself on the floor. I was twisted around and my arm had fallen asleep. As I turned over I realized Bo was laying on my arm snuggled up next to me. He awoke and we stared at each other nose to nose. He yawned and rolled over on his back, then he looked back at me as if to say, what are you waiting for? I slowly moved my free hand to run his belly. Who's a good boy? You like that? You wanna go for a walk? And with that he jumped up and ran off. He returned with his leash in his jaws, just like he would do with Andrea. His tail wagging brought a smile to my face and in that moment I realized: everything was going to be ok. We would make it through this, together.
