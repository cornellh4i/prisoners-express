**“Couple at Table” by Robert Barlett**

I hate mornings. Almost as bad as cleaning up after my cell mates. The last time wasn't as bad as most. My cellie-I’ll just call him Old School- was about 30 years older than me. He was very clean and neat, and he traveled light. He left a few things in his locker, which I bagged up and threw out- no big deal- and this picture taped to the inside of his locker door.

He’d pull it there when he arrived almost a year ago. It was the first thing he unpacked.

He had 25 pictures- all that the rules allow- all of her or the two of them. They were all very old, mostly black and white. He threw 24 of them out when they told him he was leaving. They were still in that same old yellowed envelope he’d showed me the first day and many times after. I pretended to be interested, but how many times do you want to look at the same black and white pictures of the same person?

This was his favorite. He’d stand in front of his locker and stare at it for a long time, sometimes an hour or more. I didn’t look at him then, or I pretended I didn’t see the tears in his eyes.

She’s still alive. A friend from his old ‘he’d told me she still gets around a bit.’ But she never came to visit him. No one ever did. But he talked about her all the time. At first. The first six months or so before that parole hearing. After that, not so much. But even after all those years, I know he still loved her. They took him to central prison for hospice care. He should have another parole hearing in 18 months, but he won’t make it. Still it’s hard to believe he left his favorite picture of the love of his life.
