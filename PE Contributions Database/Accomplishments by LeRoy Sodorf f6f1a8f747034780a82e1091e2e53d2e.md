**Accomplishments by LeRoy Sodorff**

Deep within

The caverns of my mind

crawling thru the passages

of space and time

unearthing those treasures of yesteryear

truly such a rare find

I grew up in a world where hula-hoops and hip huggers, corduroys and tinker toys and pet rocks and pebbles in bedrock were nothing more than a passing fancy, but rock was here to stay. So, on a whim, I took a lapidary course while in high school. What a geek huh? Anyway, whether I was up at the creek, down the river, on edge in a fog or simply at bay, I waded out into the troubled water until I hit rock bottom then, leaving no stone unturned, I dug down deep.

The guess I found were all wet, but by the time I cut them down to size, smoothed off the rough edges and shaped them into what I was looking for, they had already lost their luster just like all my other accomplishments in this life.

The American Heritage Dictionary-Second College Edition defines accomplishment as “the act of accomplishing or state of being accomplished: completion.” Over the past half-a-century, I completed several different tasks. I went to prison (though still not complete), abandoned my loving wife and kids, lost my gorgeous baik home, my three cars were repossessed, and squandered away my self-worth.

So, the next time you’re begging about all your accomplishments don’t forget about the more important ones in your life.
