**Tricky Business by Amanda Ravallette**

Tricky business starts in your head,

It’s the voice than can calm us down,

It’s the voice that causes us to drown.

It tells me I’m beautiful,

That I'll make it out of this mess,

It tells me I’m a warrior, destined for great success.

It tells me I’m skinny, it tells me I'm fat.

It tells me not to think too much.

It tells me not to let others down.

It tells me to be an inspiration to help others one day.

It tells me, yeah that’s what everyone says.

You see, it starts in the head-

This thing called Tricky Business.
