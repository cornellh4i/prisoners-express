**“Birthdays” by John Naylor**	

On my seventh birthday, dad took the family up to Grandma Naylor’s trailer on Hill Lake in Indiana. My brother Andy and I wanted to catch fish, dig for mussels and catch frogs and turtles as he commonly did, catching and releasing them. Mom took a picture of me on the porch. Dad had a surprise and brought out a snoopy reel combo and a Plano tackle box with some tackle. I remember how happy he was to give it to me. It was like a rite of passage. I still see that smile in my mind. My brother inspected the items and gave his nod of approval.

We fished and ran around all day when we weren’t on the pontoon boat with mom and dad. My dad, often deep in thought, had a far-off look in his eye. Perhaps building an antenna in his mind. I still remember that icon two-meter glowing along with the radio dial in that ‘28 Chevy on our night drives up to the lake before that birthday. That year we took the ‘26 Buick Lesaber he bought off of Grandma Naylor. Even though seven felt like a long life then, I still held a valve of memories. I’d lock all of them away if I could. I’ll never forget the joy and loving kindness in my family’s eyes and smiles. We were just enjoying simple country living. And my parents were happy to watch us play, unspoiled by the world and big city life. We’ve been through so much since then. Some think I’m crazy but I believe God is going to restore us to that or even better in his time---in this life or the next.
