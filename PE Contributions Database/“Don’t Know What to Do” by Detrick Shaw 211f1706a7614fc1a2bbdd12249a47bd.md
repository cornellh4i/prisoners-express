**“Don’t Know What to Do” by Detrick Shaw**

What am I going to do!

Mom needs my H-E-L-P

I’m here & she is not well. As I sit here I feel alone helpless. God I request one thing & I’ve tried many Many MANY times to reposition people to aid me & dealing with her still can’t see it. Maybe I should let go & jump.
