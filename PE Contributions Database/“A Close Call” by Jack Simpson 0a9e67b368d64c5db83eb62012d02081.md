**“A Close Call” by Jack Simpson**

I will not say that all fellows that live in my small town loved to hunt, but those of us didn’t spend all summer watching for certain trails being used over and over. This would be one place where a tree stand could be utilized.

William was a true friend of mine. We did what young fellows would do in the summer. Fish, have cook-outs with our families. Even camped some with our wives. Now mind you it isn’t funny when your wife is scared of spiders, snakes, and just about anything that crawls under the sky. Her idea of camping was a tv, popcorn, a movie, and a sleeping bag indoors. I will say a soft bed is ok, but nothing is like seeing the stars, smelling the fresh air, and hard ground, the sound of nature all around…

We both had scouted out a few good spots to hunt, even tagged a few trees, so they would be easy to find. Not everyone did this, but it did help the two young brothers.

I would be off work for a couple of days, and tried my best to set the sights on my rifle. At one hundred yards, I could hit a Pepsi can filled with dirt. Of course once the bullet hit its mark there wasn’t anything left.

Hamburgers are fine to some people. I love the wild taste of deer, and it is a vegetarian. What would it be like if the animal instead of being hunted became the hunter? They are so quiet in the woods. I’ve had them walk right under the very tree I was sitting in.

Talk about a surprise. Couldn’t even get a shot off. I watched as three walked right on by. After they left, so did I. Just didn’t have the heart to pull the trigger. If I had missed then it would have scared them all away.

One of the last hunting trips I went on, led us into a hunting club. All you had to do was pick a number out of the hat and that will tell you which area you hunted in. I felt it deep in my bones. It felt like it was my day for sure.

I pulled my number. It was seven. One of the hunters offered me a new twenty-dollar bill. No, proud me wouldn’t listen to my inner self. I had spent more than that on shells, food, gas and an orange vest. I;ve been told deer are color blind. To me I have my doubts. When I wear the vest nothing is brought home. Almost like the deer are laughing at the fluorescent highlighter in the tree.

My trusty stand would wrap around the tree. Itis blades would dig in. Not hurting the tree. My feet hug the straps and I would hug the tree pulling myself up like an inchworm. I had figured about forty-feet would be high enough.

It felt good to hold on to the tree, and step back putting my full weight on the back. I bounced hard to lock it down. Felt like it was deep enough. Slow and easy, I turned to sit down.

Looking down and around. It hit me that this could have been a mistake. I know most people have had a feeling that something just wasn’t right: Twenty minutes went by, and haven’t seen even a bird or squirrel.

Right about now that twently was looking great. It wasn’t long before I felt the tree move. I could see the trees around me swaying with a light breeze. Then a jolt brought me to reality. Was it the wind or movement of the tree? This tree was a pine. Hardwood trees don’t work too well, silence the bark is really fine. Then it happened again. This time I went for the ride of my life. From the height of forty-four feet to just about eighteen-inches from the ground. On the way down I couldn’t decide if I wanted to throw my rifle or jump.

With that sudden stop. It was a real close call. That was well over thirty-five years ago and since then I gave up deer hunting. No-more deer stands and Bambie is safe from me.
