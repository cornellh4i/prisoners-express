**“Heroes Vs. Hypocrites” by J.C. Young**

****I’m conflicted! Yes, participating in this *wait* will afford me and my family opportunities - mind you, less opportunities than the average white American in 1963 - But also equally justified is the disdain and indignation I feel for the mistreatment and inequality I endured on a daily basis as a black American. Jim Crow is brutally degrading. Yet, here I sit, hoping to defend this country. *Begging* to defend it, actually. As if my life isn’t good enough to waste on a country that hates me.

“Yeah, that’s an interesting dilemma,” Latrel, the mulatto brother in the next seat observes. I initially met him at the recruiting office. They threw us in the same barracks during boot camp - which is hardly surprising considering the air force only has two dormitories reserved for black soldiers. We ran up hills, side by side, with eighty pound packs strapped to our back, crawled through mud; under spiky wires and sealed twenty foot walls; *all* in the name of a country that despise us.

“Yeah, ‘*interesting*’, that’s one way to put it,” Jamal, the brother next to him, contributed to the conversation.

He’s a Tuskegee graduate - top of his class - wrote for the North Star and even had a brother represent this country in the Olympics. But with black skin, nobody cared. He was cursed to the same misfortune as the rest of us.

“Alright, guys,” Commander Springwell ordered, “Calm it down. We got work to do!” After the noise dies down, he resumes - “They don’t like us. We know that. Heck, half the country thinks we don’t even belong here. The other half thinks we’re not ‘sophisticated enough’ to fly no planes. Well, guess what? I don’t care what they think. We are the Tuskegee Airmen! Not only are we flying those mini-bombers, but we’re the best da-gone pilots this country has ever seen.”

Frankly, after a short while, I tune him out. The commander’s patriotic rhetoric usually precedes our missions: How great this country is; how we should be proud to sacrifice our life for it and hope *they* recognize our value and afford us equal rights.

As if, unlike all other races in this country, we have to *earn* decent treatment. But the truth is, no race has contributed more free labor in creating this country ten us. *PERIOD*: Blood, sweat, tears, and pregnant women hanging from trees while their babies hung by their umbilical cords.

“Alright, mission starts at 0700 hours. Be ready. The United States Navy will not wait on you,” With that, Commander Springwell storms out the room, leaving us to ponder another arduous mission.

“Man, I’m tired of this shit!” Larry - on the bench directly behind me - announces, like he always does, “If we was white, we would have the new planes instead of those cheap crap.”

“Not today, Larry,” Latrel says and gets up, “The way I see it any mission could be our last. And if I’ma die out here, ‘lest I could do is get me some pussy ‘fore I go!”

“You ain’t think you made enough high-yellow babies out here yet. ‘Finna have Germany lookin’ like Harlem in no time.” Big Willy said from the last seat on the second bench.

“Let’s get the party started then,” Larry says and gets up, bracing a hand on my shoulder as he does.

“We gotta pretty early start tomorrow,” I say, always sounding like the annoying grandmother.

“We know,” Jamal - the Tuskegee graduate - concedes.

“Shie, better get it out our system ‘fore we go back home; that respect-for-a-blackman-shit will be over.” Latrel’s comment sanctions a stale silence that dominates the room. We avoid each other’s eyes, suddenly finding meaningless tasks to occupy ourselves with.

The truth is, the real fight - for *us*, at least - is back home. Brothers like Malcolm, Luther - even the *boxer*, Muhammed Ali - are making headlines condemning America for doing exactly what *we’re* doing. How are we supposed to feel? Serving as agents of an imperialistic regime looking to oppress people of color like they’re doing *us.*

**My girlfriend’s stopped replying to my letters. She’s joined “The Revolution”. To her, I’m a hypocrite; a boot-licking “Uncle Tom”!

Somberly, one at a time, we all mope out the room, a slight slump in our shoulder.

Out the dining hall, across the compound - beneath a gloomy night - we all enter our sleeping quarters. We each go to our bunks and stew in thought. Out the window, by the field of planes, crickets, frogs, and other critters in the night ridicule us with an ominous chorus.

“Well, I’m finna’ go partying ‘fore we get into this dog-fight tomorrow. Who’s coming?” Latrel’s words - aimed at infusing some levity back into the situation - splatter against the wall and slowly slide down onto the dirt floors.

“Man, I’m going to sleep,” Jamal says and turns towards the wall.

“Shie, that’s what I’m doing,” Big Willy echoes.

One by one, those sentiments are repeated throughout the dorm.

“How ‘bout you, Dewayne,” He finally asks me.

“Naw, bra’, sleep’s what I’m doing.”

“Shie, why is that?”

“Because, in this situation, ain’t nothing to party about.”

And with that, I too, turn around, face the wall, and call it a night.
