**“Be Careful What You Wish For” by Mark Daigre**

I just went for a walk in the woods--I swear! I had no idea that I had magic or that I would ever end up this way.

I’m pretty sure that it was a Wednesday morning. You know the ones, where you have nothing to do and plenty of time to do it in. I was feeling a bit “at odds” so to speak. I didn’t feel like reading, watching TV or hanging out at the coffee shop. I decided to go for a walk instead. Feeling adventurous, I went past the two trails that I almost always take and continued on down the road until I found a trailhead that I had never noticed before. Thinking back, I don’t think that I ever even saw the parking lot before. Anyway, I was soon on a single track trail that would through the trees and along a cliff face. Feeling totally out of my league, I went on, going forward and keeping a promise to myself, never going back.

Sooner than I expected, the trail spit me out into a “glade,” I guess that’s what it’s called. Wide open space, filled with flowers, whining insects, and the song of birds I couldn’t identify. I also noticed a tingly feeling all over that I’d never felt before.

In the middle of the glade, a tree was swaying back and forth, like in a strong wind. Curious, I went up and peeked through the branches. An orderly rank of squirrels, equipped with what looked like small arms and light artillery were busy firing over, through and around the branches and trunks at an equally bizarre looking and equiped looking grouping of chipmunks who were firing back at them with the same ferocity.

Seeing me, both sides stopped, turned their weapons to me, and started firing away. I ran. Just in time, it seemed, I ran until I was out of breath and then ran some more. Looking back over my shoulder, I could see the ground where I was standing, torn up, smoking and on fire.

Not wanting any part of their conflict, I kept going until I couldn’t go any further. Falling on the ground, I spoke under my breath, “Those guys are going to wipe each other out, if they don’t knock that shit off.” That’s when I heard that special WHOMP that comes from a large explosion. The tree was now a pile of flaming splinters, with a mushroom cloud growing into the sky above.

A couple of hours later, I sat down and wished I’d packed a lunch. “This sure would be a good place for a McDonalds.” Before I could finish the thought, in the time it takes to blink, a full blown McDonalds was there perfect in every detail down to the drive-through. Ordering lunch, I noticed that the only wierd thing was that all the staff were faries or pixies or nymphs or something. The food wasn’t strictly Micky D’s, but it was tasty.

Gnomes and elves, gnomes and elves, gnomes and elves. They had a town that was literally cut in two with a wall almost as tall as me. The elves challenges me; the gnomes welcomed me. I was fed, clothed, and given a place tos tay for the next couple of weeks. That first afternoon, I was invited to almost every gnome home and given a massive plate of food. I tasted everything and passed out late that night, stuffed and very drunk from the beer they kept pouring.

While I played with the gnomes, they taught me about my magic, and I helped them straighten out their defenses. We built a moat, and they showed me how to make things appear and go away with just my words. At one point, I even made an entire neighborhood move three feet to the left, just because I thought it would look better that way.

I moved on. Mostly because I couldn’t sleep on the floor of their meeting hall anymore. I had a crick in my neck that just wouldn’t go away. I slept roughly for a couple of nights and found myself tired, muddy, and bruised from a fall down a steep slope into a muddy stream. “A nice, hot bath sure would be nice right about now.” Nothing happened.

“I said… A Nice Hot Bath Sure Would Be Nice Right About NOW!” I repeated with a bit more force. Still, nothing happened. Perplexed, I moved out of the water and into a stand of willows. That was when I heard the sound of hoofbeats coming from both up and down stream. I baked further into the thicket until I was up against the trunk of an older, larger tree.

Two armed and fierce looking groups of centaurs met in battle right in front of me. Screams, warcries, and the clash of bladed weapons echoed through the hills. “I just want to be unnoticed, like a part of this tree.” I spoke that without thinking.

Now I’m stuck here. I cannot move, or speak or blink. I haven’t laughed or cried, screamed or spoken a word in countless days. I’ve seen the seasons come and go so many times that I’ve lost counts.

Oh shit, here comes the squirrels...
