**“Helping Out” by Kevin Hale**

****Growing up like I did was a struggle from day to day, so once I landed myself in prison I was used to adversity and maintained my “go get it” outlook on life. With that said help was a foreign subject to me, both giving and receiving.

Becoming a mirror image of the gangsters in my neighborhood led me to become someone else; not myself. Time spent away from everyone and everything I know led me to the realization that I didn’t know myself. When asked who I was I could only answer with the name of the gang I belonged to.

I had seen families on television and thought is that what it’s really like? I wondered what would have been were I one them; heading me to want to find the me I never had the chance to be.

In this process I studied I studied many religions and or philosophical views; however, I always felt like an outcast. One day I picked up a pagan newsletter and that's where I found myself. I’ve since read anything I can find on Asatru, Odinic beliefs, and the Norse gods and goddesses. trh
