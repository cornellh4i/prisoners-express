**"Boys Smoking" by Samuel K. Byrd**

Even today, I cannot look at that picture and not cringe. My two best buds and I tried to look cool and rebellious, but thinking back, we were more like rebels without a clue. Yep, the good ole days hanging with four-eyed Freddy and my cousin Tony, who was more like a brother to me after his mom, my aunt Pam died. I met Fred in the 6th grade, and we attended Wake Forest together. Anthony Bethel, Christopher Mitchell, and Freddrick Thompson: the Three Musketeers, as we were called back then. “One for all and all for one,” unless there was a girl involved because then it was nice guys finish last.

In the group, Tony was the self-appointed ladies’ man probably because our moms were Italian and his dad was a Puerto Rican Naval Officer. Freddy honed in one of the geeks and nerds, which came in handy during finals, while I had a thing for chubby chicks--hey big girls need love too.

As teens, we did everything from cow tipping and mud bogging, to holding church fundraisers and leading student protests against taking pizza off the lunch menu. I did mention that I was part Italian and so is pizza! Even though we were members of the local Boy Scouts, JROTC, the Debate Team, even life guards at the YMCA, there were a few times when dad had to talk to his boss, the sheriff on our behalf. It seems that mall security hates when teens skateboard on the roof while launching Roman candles.

I’ll admit, saints we were not; friends who were focused on the future we were. With all of the ups and downs, disappointments and setbacks, who would have thought that three silly kids from the trailer park would go on to do great things? Tony lead the first mining team for NASA as they attempt to build permanent structures on the moon. Freddy is now the president of Wake Forest, while I did not let the death of my wife stop me from pursuing the dream we had. I am the owner of Pleasantly Plump, a lingerie store exclusively for BBW. Currently there are 27 locations plus the online service which I run by myself and with the help of my lovely daughter, Pamela Mitchell.
