****I’ve got the family down on the beach on Galveston Island one day, attempting to escape the torrid Houston heat of summer. I’ve got the baby in my arms, and we’re wading in the gentle waist-deep water. My wife is nearby with the older two, also enjoying the waves.

Suddenly, my left arm and left side of my chest feel like they’re been hit with a sledge hammer, and I feel tremendous pressure, like the entire gulf pressing down on me. The wife must have seen my distress because suddenly, she is right next to me. I hand off the baby to her, and she takes the child and backs several feet away from me. I go under--my legs giving out while the heart attack continues.

It’s true that the pain of a heart attack is indescribable with its excruciating pain and fear of what’s happening to you. I go under the water without being able to take a breath, and there’s so much going on inside me that I can’t think straight or react positively! Then I look up from under the waves, and I can see my wife’s face. She’s smiling down at me, like she’s having a great time. My fear of dying and anger at her cause adrenaline to hit my system, and I’m able to overcome the debilitating pain. I come up from underwater and am able to stumble my way back onto the sand where bystanders have already summoned EMTs.

Facing fear and fearing the unknown are sometimes not as bad as facing life. She was smiling!
