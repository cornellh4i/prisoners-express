**Bargains by Since Asiatic Sword Allah**

Discounts, discounts, discounts! When I think about bargains my mind automatically rewinds to the time that I spent in that cramped little cemented room. With a public defender, a small table, two iron chains, and an intercom button. The way the justice legal system is set up, make bargains seem one sided. The public defender’s job is supposed to be representing your side of the case. However since the public defender isn't getting paid to represent you by you, the interests of the public defender are not in favor of the client. Sitting across the table from the person who is supposed to be my voice in court only wanted me to sign a plea bargain. I wanted to fight for freedom, and my innocence however my advocate didn’t think we had a fighting chance. Being ignorant of the law I was pressured into believing that I was being given the best bargain ever, because of the severity of my charges. I understand that the plea bargain deal is not about my innocence or my freedom, it’s documentation and the paper trail that’s reconstructing the establishment of the slave-trade. Upon agreeing on this bargain deal we lose our right to due process. These plea bargains are not fair and they allow the D.A. to receive a conviction without properly investigating the evidence in the case. Discounts discounts discounts! Plea bargains are not discounts to sabotage freedom.
