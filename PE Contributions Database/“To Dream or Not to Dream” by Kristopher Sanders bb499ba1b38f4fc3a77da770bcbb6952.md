**“To Dream or Not to Dream” by Kristopher Sanders**

This haze that surrounds me keeps the sun at bay. Is there a sun anymore? Or am I damned to a life swallowed by this infernal fog? Today I lost sight of the future, if there was a future to be seen. It’s amazing what this fog can hide. How did I get lost here in the first place?

As I thought about these questions I shuffle along in line with the rest of these zombies. Our paper cups beckon from their places in neat little rows in a sterile setting. The fluorescent lights highlight their places as if they were in a spotlight. Actors in a silent play.

Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle.

The line moves along like a caricature of a millipede. A hundred legs shifting and shuffling to move the body along in jerks and stops. All of that just to reach the cup that promises a hazy interpretation of reality. But who’s reality do I reside in? This foggy world of numb effect or the world I only glimpse on a rare occasion of lucidity?

8:35. My lover awaits me only feet away. Beckoning me with her alluring array of colors she displays daily. She gaily decorates her austere white cup. Promising a good time she calls for Herman, questioning his lack of progress in picking her up.

Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle.

My heart beats faster as I realize they could keep me from my daily dose of destiny. My breath begins to come in ragged gasps. Hands shaking, I stumble forward. Thump, thump! Thump, thump! I feel lightheaded from my anxiety as I come to the conclusion that I’m purposely being kept from my love, my destiny.

“Get back in line,” comes the directive.

Not listening, I continue on a straight course to her beckoning array.

“Hey! Did you hear me?” He asks as I stumble past another inmate. “Get your ass back in line!”

Ignoring his warning I push someone to the side. Hands grab at my arm, but I easily pull away. She calls again from her prison and I answer with a quiet snarl.

Now the guard moves in on me with his radio in hand, signaling a disturbance. I am almost within reach of her. Then the unthinkable happens- destiny is being wheeled away from me as the guard steps into my path. Without hesitation I barrel into him like a defensive lineman, knocking him to the floor.

I am slammed into from behind. Allowing my momentum to carry me into an inmate, I use him for balance as I swing behind me to block any more attacks as I pursue destiny. As I reach to grab the cart holding my lover I feel the bite of the taser in my back. I grab the edge as the current begins to flow through me. As I start to lose consciousness I see my lover and her friends fly in all directions. Then darkness surrounds me.

“No!” I shout, but no sound comes out. The thickness of my tongue and gumminess of my mouth alert me to the fact that I have been shot up with something.

Yet to open my eyes, I realize I’m strapped down to the bed by my hands and ankles. A soreness in my muscles reminds me of the tazing I took. There is no play in the restraints that bind me. I begin to shake as I realize I can’t move.

My eyes fly open. Sunlight pours into my room. What was thought to be restraints was nothing more than a tangle of sheets. I lie awake in my room at home. It was only a dream. The pain coming from cramped muscles. A mobile of pills slowly spins above my bed. A constant reminder of my weakness. A co-dependency of mind and reality, but it’s my reality. As I emerge from the fog of my dreams to find maybe it wasn’t a dream after all.

As I watch, a small half-dollar sized Pac-Man moves wraith-like through the wall heading straight for the mobile. In a panic I start to reach for it to save it, but am restrained. As I fight the tangle, the wraith continues to devour my mobile and I go into a frenzy.

It’s as if I become so entangled that I cannot move. Spittle flies from my mouth from an endless cry for mercy. Then Pac-Man flees as Donkey Kong moves into the room with a syringe for an arm. He jams it into my thigh and within seconds my panic begins to slow. His poison courses into my blood causing me to become disembodied. I blink once, then twice, and the scene changes to an all too familiar antiseptic room. Donkey Kong becomes the night nurse and I realize the dream was my reality as I drift off to la la land.
