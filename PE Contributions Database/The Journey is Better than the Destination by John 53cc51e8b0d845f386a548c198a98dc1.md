**"The Journey is Better than the Destination" by Johnathan McGeoch**

I had two weeks off from my Army job. The dogs were off at sitters and the wife and kids were ready for the 19-hour journey north to our family in our new (to us) minivan. The van was stocked with food and drinks for the trip. I am an OCD lunatic that plans everything out by the minute. This trip would try to cure me. I only stop for fuel, do not believe in fast food and plan the road trip menu to be both healthy and while decreasing BMI’s. Trust me, you don’t want to travel with me.

We leave at 8 pm even though I had worked from 10 pm until 10 am the night before and had only napped for an hour. The plan is for the kids to fall asleep soon and the wife to follow suit a couple of hours later, getting half the trip in before they awaken. All goes well until Charlotte when we encounter snow. No big deal. I’m from New York state and can handle snow. 81-N should be clear, right?

Yeah, but only through North Carolina. Virginia is a different story. Slowed down is an understatement. The radio repeated how the roads were all closed, but if the exit ramps have a foot of snow on them, I’ll stick with the highway. 5 MPH is no way to go 1,100 miles, but I am stubborn and will not be denied.

The family wakes up as we are stuck in traffic. Literal all-out traffic jam. She offers to take the wheel...she thought I was serious about switching drivers in the morning. Nope, that was just an excuse to get her to sleep through the night. These 1,100 miles is all mine. She is there to man the computer, phone, cooler, keep the boys happy and not laugh as I do calculus in my head to avoid getting drowsy. Yeah, I’m that guy.

Luckily, we got some real winners near us, so I regale the boys with stories about the backstories of everybody else stuck in the traffic jam.

Things clear up and we resume our snail's pace. As we go through the mountain, I see some fun anomalies like overturned snowplows and as we make one steep ascent the car trying to pass us spins out and beings to descend. I keep on trekking northbound.

Despite the low speeds, these snow crews are not used to a foot and a half or more of snow and most of the plows wind up either in a ditch or overturned; ergo a great level of concentration is requisite to staying on the road (or what is to pass for a road at this point.)

When we finally hit the Maryland static line, it is dark already, but I have never been so happy to get out of a state as I am to leave Virginia.

And of course, the 30 or so miles of Maryland are somehow worse! By this point, the wife is getting nervous about my being behind the wheel for over a day straight, the kids are getting restless, and I am still perfectly content to pee in a bottle for the next 10-12 hours, though perhaps the mental acuity to transpose philosophy into mathematics is somewhat mushy.

We settle on this. We will make it through Maryland and then see how Pennsylvania roads look before deciding whether or not to call it a night.

At 1 am and 6 miles into Pennsylvania, I finally make the call to get a hotel room. The roads are slightly better, but I am toasted and ready to call it.

We get a cheap room and pass out. By 3 am, I eventually wake the wife, carry the sleeping boys to the car and we drive the final 6 hours on clear roads. The boys and wife wake up around the time I pull into her parents' driveway and her father has prepared a killer breakfast. We attack the day with the most memorable part of the vacation behind us.
