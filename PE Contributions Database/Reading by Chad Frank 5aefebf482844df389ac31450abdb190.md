**"Reading" by Chad Frank**

My mom bought me my first book when I was two, *Bobo and His Blue Jacket*. Bobo’s a baby elephant whose mom buys him a new blue jacket, which he accidentally rips while playing and has to get repaired before his mom finds out. I loved that story so much, I had my om read it to me over and over again. Eventually, she got tired of doing so and started skipping pages. Of course, since I’d heard the story so often, I caught on to what she was doing.

This made me wonder: what else was my mom trying to pull on me? Not wanting to miss out on anything else, I made it my mission to teach myself how to read, which I did before I enrolled in kindergarten.

Learning how to read so young gave me a distinct advantage not only over other kids, but also adults. Other kids had to depend on adults to read to them; adults couldn’t conceal information by spelling out words the way they could with other kids.

Growing up, other kids teased me because they thought I was weird because I always had my nose buried in a book. But I didn’t care. The way I saw it, they were the ones who were missing out. While they were squabbling over toys and TV remotes, I was perfectly content to sit quietly in a corner with nothing but a book. While they whined about being bored, I was in Neverland battling Captain Hook and his pirates, slaying dragons with King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table or blasting off to faraway galaxies.

As I got older, I realized that I could find the answers to questions adults were unwilling or unable to share. By simply strolling into the public library, I gained access to information about sex, murder, mayhem and other forbidden topics and pretty much whatever else I wanted to know about. This only made me love reading even more.

As an awkward teenager, I found kindred spirits in Holden Caulfield and other flawed protagonists. Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and the rest of the Best writers appealed to my nonconformist sensibilities.

As a young adult, I discovered Transgressive authors like Bret Easton Ellis and Chuck Palahniuk. I loved their gritty style and could strongly relate to their dark and debauched novels because they so closely resembled my own life.

I now prefer confessional memoirs because I enjoy their voyeuristic nature and empathize with the authors’ struggles with addictions, mental illness and other obstacles.

I find myself reading more voraciously than ever… Pretty much from the time I open my eyes each morning until I pass out with a book in my hand, often long after midnight. Book are such an essential part of my existence, I ask for them as my birthday and Christmas gifts in lieu of money. I love books because they keep my mind off my lengthy sentence by allowing me to escape the concrete and razor wire of my cold, harsh reality. They also provide me with everything I most desire: knowledge, acceptance, and above all, freedom.
