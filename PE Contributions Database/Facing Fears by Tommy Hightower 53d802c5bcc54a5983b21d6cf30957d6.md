****Prison life forces you to face fears in a way like no other life circumstance. Most newly arrived prison patrons have so much fear deep inside that it can paralyze the unprepared.

Prisons are stereotypically very violent places. Yet most of the prisons are filled with people doing under 5 years for nonviolent crimes and/or drug-related offenses. Yet they all fear the stereotype they see on TV. That is true for only a small percentage. Mostly, the maximum security facilities are the ones filled with murderers and gang bangers. Those maximum security pens are no joke. Fear is a daily life experience. Facing fear with bravado saves you from the other guy who is just as scared, and a scared man is a deadly man. This results in deadly conflicts. Yet it’s not the majority of inmates at prison.

Most prisons are filled with medium security men and women who have made a mistake in life. Yet society is so scared of the criminal element that it refuses to give them a chance to reenter society and make an honest living.

The American Public needs to face their fears of those paroling from prisons daily. There is nothing to fear but fear itself. So face your fears with love, faith, and confidence in God and self to overcome whatever life throws at you.

Fear can be a killer or a life saver, but it’s always best to face fears and learn from it. Have faith in yourself to overcome fear and adapt or conquer it. We Americans are famous for our ability to take our fears and turn them into innovation.

Take care, dear friends. Life is too short to live it in fear.
