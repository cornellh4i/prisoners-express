**“Women of the World” by Delvin Diles**

I was raised by women. My mama, Rosie Marie and her mama Emma Lee, paper sack brown, black, and hardworking country women both raised their children without fathers. They always demanded respect and taught me to be kind and observant.

When I left home at 17 I did not take all my home training with me. I did cruel things. I hurt people. I did foolish things. I put trust in people I barely knew. In less than a year out on my own in the world, I would be sentenced to life in prison.

The women I encouraged in that year over 20 years ago are few. Some I knew briefly, such as my manager Lisa at Chuck E. Cheese who smoked and had kids older than me. Yet she talked to me as an adult during our smoke breaks about her life doings, relationships, and problems. I remember being at a loss for words. But thankfully, she did not press me for much feedback or come off as annoyed with my head nods.

Others I knew closer such as Darla, the 19-year-old self-professed nympho who lived in the apartment below mine and my roommates.

“Whenever you wanna fuck, knock on my door,” she told us. “It don’t matter what time.”

I wish I had thought of more to say to these women. Maybe if I would have been more loquacious in our interactions I could have asked Lisa out to the movies, or asked what her favorite R+B group was then surprised her with tickets to their concert; or asked Darla her birthday, then throw her a surprise party to make her feel special and not just the chick we passed around; or told Yolanda that dancing with her is a blessing and ask her to slow dance with me to the song we picked as ‘our song’: “Cupid” by 112. That way maybe memories of them could be just that much deeper and would resonate with fullness, and not seem so distant and incomplete. A world away, but I hope they and women everywhere attain the joy, love, and fulfillment that gives their life meaning. That they meet every obstacle with vigor, every problem with focus, and never be thwarted by those that intend to block their paths toward betterment and self-actualization. I wish and send you all love, sisters behind bars, sisters in college, sisters everywhere. I love you, I appreciate you, I miss you.
