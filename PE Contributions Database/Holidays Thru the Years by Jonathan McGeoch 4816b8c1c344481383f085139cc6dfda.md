**"Holidays Thru the Years" by Jonathan McGeoch**

Shortly after my incarceration began, my (now-ex-) wife came to the startling recognition the at my mashed potato would not be a staple of Thanksgiving. It turns out that I will celebrate 11 such Thanksgivings behind bars. As I approach the 5th of these seasons of incarceration, I will seek to differentiate between my holidays in and out.

Last year, I was a cook here, so I got up at 2 and began to prepare an awesome meal for 1100 of my closest friends. I was busy, and it was a blast. During breakfast, I ran out into the Dining Room and loaded up my mule’s coat with bits of goodies.

My eldest son’s first Christmas was our first in Korea. They don’t do the whole tree thing, and I am not particularly attached to the practice, so we went with an inflatable crab (pool toy) in the corner of the living room. Other than that, we had fairly standard decorations. We put the toys around the crab and he didn’t know the difference. By Christmas morning, there was a hole in the deflated crab and it looked kind of pathetic, but he was in his glory with all the new toys. The next day, little Woo took his first steps, but he wouldn’t do so in front of his mother until the New Year.

A couple Christmas’s ago, I brought a ton of food out of the kitchen, and my best friend and I ate like kings that evening. The dinner in the kitchen was nice, but it was even better to enjoy dinner with someone that is like family to me.

My second Thanksgiving in Korea, I invited about 15 of my closest friends--most away from home and family, or Korean and unaware of American Thanksgiving feasts. We woke up early, and my wife had morning sickness for the only time, so I ran back and forth between the 2 kitchens for 6 hours, getting everything cooked and keeping everything warm. My mashed potatoes went to a whole new level that day, we introduced a Mexican friend to cranberry sauce, and the Koreans discovered just how seriously we Americans take our feast days.

This coming holiday season is a big question mark. I no longer work in the kitchen, so I won’t be too busy on those days. I no longer have any close friends to share the day with. I knew I will call my parents, the boys, and my significant other on those days. I will probably get a hard workout in, have a decent meal, walk the track for a while, and such. Time will tell.

My Thanksgiving in Afghanistan was fun. My friend’s wife sent him a box of non-perishable goods to make a complete meal. We got a bag of charcoal, fired up the grill, and made green bean casserole, instant mashed potatoes, turkey from a microwave dinner, and pies, rolls, the whole nine yards. Paled in comparison to the amazing lunch the dining hall provided, but nothing compares to spending time around a grill, under the stars with some close friends.

In the fall of 2022, I will get to enjoy the holidays with my children and family for the first time since 2009. That will become my most memorable holiday, but each one provides me with memories and uniqueness.
