"Parental Discretion" by Eric Williams

I could not believe that, my mother, the one who carried me for nine months in her womb, who birthed me into this world and raised me for seventeen years--by herself, would resort to the type of violence she had administered to me only an hour ago.

Okay, yes. My mother has disciplined me when I was much younger by spanking me with her hand. As I got older, she occasionally resorted to using a belt. But in those very few instances she always showed great restraint, temperance, and was focused on claiming the attention of my disobedient mind rather than hurting my body.

As I lie here alone on this park bench, I continually ask myself, *why did she have to go that far?* Why did she have to slap me across my face so hard that the force of the blow sent me down on one knee? *Why? Why? Why?* I’m left without an answer that makes sense to me, but I have come up with a solution.

I even saw the shock in her face as she swung, making contact with my tender flesh. The moment she raised her hand and set it in motion towards my face, I noticed a slight hesitation. To me, when she came to that point of indecision, I believe that she was at war within herself. She was mentally struggling to break through the barrier that separated her usual self-controlled mannerisms from her short-tempered fury that had sat dormant over the span of twenty-odd years. Once she realized she’d crossed that fine line, she knew there was no turning back. The sound of her flesh against my flesh jarred her mind back into its rightful place, that place called sanity. Years of coping with disappointments in life burdened her passive and everso accepting ways of facing adversities.

She stood back and watched my reaction with a look of disbelief that scrawled upon her countenance. As my hand shot up to my face to the place I’d been struck, I gave her a look in return masked with as much scrutiny and contempt as I could muster. At that particular moment, she was no longer my loving, caring, compassionate, God-fearing matriarch I’d come to worship and adore. She was, however, a demon-possessed.
