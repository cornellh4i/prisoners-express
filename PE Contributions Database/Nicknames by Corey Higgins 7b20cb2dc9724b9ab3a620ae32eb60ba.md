They say there is power within every name itself, and so having a nickname is like gaining a second power, or could it be a second person within us? I’ve had a nickname since I was a young teen, and after years of being called by it on and off the streets, I finally got it tattooed on my forehead: “Lil C.”

“Lil” because I’ve always been short and cared little about what others thought of me. Guess “C” stands for Corey, plus you could always see that I was involved in everything around. Some say I always see what’s coming next. After being called Lil C for so many years, it seems so funny when another person calls me “Corey.” It’s like I’m two different people because mostly people who know me well call me “Lil C” while others who just met me or a person in passing would use “Corey.”

Now I’m listed under some STG list on the whole east coast, and my nickname has gotten many different meanings. So after two years of fighting the State and Feds to take me off the STG list since they claim I am a high rank gang member. “Though I do ride, I’m not a gang member.” Soo now the nickname I grew up with is causing me a lot of trouble, hat and being almost fully tattooed does not help LOL. Of course, when I first started doing time back and forth, I made a name for myself, and not all of it was bad. But as it stands, “Lil C” on North Carolina’s State prison system is still on some dumb STG, or now they say I am only on the watch list STG (Security Threat Group). Being on this list sucks since I’m the one who is mostly calming people down or drawing greeting cards for many of my brothers.

So when you get or want a nickname, be careful of how it’s viewed, and know that it’s not the name that makes the person. As it stands, my fellow brothers call me “Lil C,” and if they need something or want a piece of art drawn up, they know who to come see: Lil C.
