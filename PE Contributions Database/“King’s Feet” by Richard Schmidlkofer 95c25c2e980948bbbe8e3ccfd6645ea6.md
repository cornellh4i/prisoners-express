**“King’s Feet” by Richard Schmidlkofer**

Luke 2:11-14 “For there is born to you this day in the city of David a savior (King), who is Christ the Lord. And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloth, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God saying: ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men”’

When I see this picture I see God’s hand on his son Jesus. Bring Him to earth to teach: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humbleness, self-control (Galatians 5:22-23)

He walked in our footsteps. He felt our pain, his feet are pure. He had no scars until He was nailed on the cross.

We have to walk with Him to have love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humbleness, self-control. I’m not sure of this, but I believe all religions have some kind of person or God you follow in his footsteps. We need to follow them to have PEACE IN THIS WORLD.

I would like to wish everybody Happy Holidays.
