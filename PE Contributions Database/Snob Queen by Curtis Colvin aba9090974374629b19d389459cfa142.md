"Snob Queen" by Curtis Colvin

Her name was Chrissy, queen of the snobs. She could put you in your place within ten seconds. All she cared about, was Chrissy. If she came up to talk to you, she wanted something. Other than that, leave her alone. She doesn’t care about your thoughts or your feelings.

She was raised as an entitlement kid. She was entitled to whatever she wanted, and she didn’t have to work for it at all. Gimme, gimme, gimme. One day, I saw her work on her dad. A few blinks of her eyes, a little pouty face, and wham! She got what she wanted.

She could have been a model. But that was work, nothing but a four letter word to her. So when her parents caught her smoking, they put their foot down and said no for the first time. Well, that kicked in the rebel that was in her.

She started doing all kinds of drugs, just to show *them*. One night, she stole her dad’s BMW and took a joy ride. She stopped by my house to buy some K-2. I asked if I could come along, but the snob queen said no. She got what she wanted from me, and that’s that.

I guess someone was looking out for me. A few hours later, Chrissy flipped her dad’s car and was ejected through the windshield. It was a sad ending to a spoiled life. But, already another has stepped into her shoe and title: Brandy, the new snob queen. I hope history doesn’t repeat itself.
