**“Molly” **by Sean Dunne**

****She was standing before a mirror which hung beside the bedroom hallway, obsessing over herself. He could see the hollows where the flesh of her cheeks should have been; their plum hue diminished to the pallor of death. The places on her skin where she attempted to obliterate what was symbolic of her destruction. Red marks everywhere. Bruises. Some of the faded purple were of yesterday’s manic fit. Others, the abysmal blue of the present.

He had tremendous pity on her. There she stood in effigy of the horror of drugs. Her family somewhere out there, fighting with themselves and fulfilling the scripture with their own liturgy in preparation of her mourning. Molly stuck in a mirror at the connects pad, fussing with her make-up and hair as if it made a fucking difference at all. As if any amount of blush and mascara, save that peculiar to the undertaker’s touch, could possibly conceal what the shadows of her eyes plainly revealed.

He stood behind her in perfect view, but she refused to see him. The insanity fidgeting in her retina, cornea, iris, and pupils was a veil in which his pity filled. So he called out to her, “Molly.” The apparition of a somewhat embarrassed child appeared from her shadow.

Instantly, her mouth stopped working so hard. Her lips desisted their horrible twitching, and the muscles in her temples followed suit, revealing at short length the arrest of her grinding jaw. She must’ve become aware of her unsettling visage because although her skin could scarcely muster the rogue. There was a change in her expression which cried out plainly of blush. And she looked so beautiful.

“I’d like to be your friend,” he told her. She seemed to absorb this comment with the exact sudden comfort which she intended. Revealing a glamorous girl that no trite rock-a-billy icon could ever condescend to fuck with, she smiled. Molly regarded him as though he were the sweetest boy that she ever encountered in her dreadfully friendship-less life. Her smile made up for ten years of his life. He beheld her reluctant gaze. She tried to avert her eyes, but once more, his voice recalled the nucleus of her attention.

“Molly, I see myself in you. So I’mma tell you what I shoulda told myself: This shit ain’t shit, but this shit can fucking kill you. What you are dealing with is death… Please, please just take a couple days to sleep and eat, and you’ll see that things can get better. You seem so unhappy. If you keep going, you are going to die. Please.

“Look around you. You’re stuck in a fucking dope house. Yeah, you’re getting high for free, but is it really free, Molly? You’re worth more than your body. Has anybody ever given a fuck enough about to tell you that?”

A single tear besmeared her too thick mascara. “My mom,” she quivered.

“Well, she’s right. What the hell are we doing? Running from our families, from ourselves. You think you’re the only one who’s in pain? You think nobody understands what you’ve been through? Huh?” She shook her head and shook a tear from her cheek. “I can’t stop either. They used to tell me I was 14 going on 40. Now I’m just going on 40. Look at me.” She could hardly do anything else. “Molly, my future is in the past. But you are worth saving. Fuck all these idiots around here. They have no souls. But you--aw, fuck it.” He searched her eyes for understanding. With something like the tinkling bell which signifies the ceremony for an angel who finally got wings, she confirmed her comprehension.

If he had stayed in the antechamber of her spirit a moment longer, he surely would have begun to cry. So he went into the kitchen and shot some dopr. He did a little too much and fell onto the carpet in the living room, clawing at his chest and begging God to forgive him for all of his sins--too many to recount in the split second of death.
