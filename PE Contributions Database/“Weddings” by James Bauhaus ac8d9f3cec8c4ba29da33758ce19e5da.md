**“Weddings” by James Bauhaus**

****I avoid them, along with most other rituals. Being an amateur anthropologist makes them tedious and boring to me, and makes me annoying and aloof to them. If someone is a close friend, I’ll attend. I’m happy to bring a present and smile, shake a few hands, wish-well and congratulate, but then I’m gone. Good luck to everyone who needs this type of cement to keep them together, but adversity does a much better job of it. When the whole world is trying to find you, and do you in, and you have to depend on each other to escape another grind through the government’s conviction machine, this is where you find real personal value. People held together by mere parties and good times are the first ones to cave in, run away, and turn on their friends and family when the cop merely scowls and stamps his foot. Soft, ignorant people are often frivolous. They’re fine for the good times, but a hindrance once the roof caves in. This is why I’m sincere and serious when I tell them, “Good luck with your wedding.”

One wedding that I *would* like to see, and attend, is the one that might occur between science and politics, where science is the monarch of Saudi Arabia, and all U.S. politicians, particularly trump, Pruitt and Inhofe, are his obedient, burka-clad brides. None of them would be allowed to drive cars or exit the haram without a burly male escort. None of them would even be allowed to speak until asked.

Or maybe better would be a scenario such as a backwoods Kentucky-like wedding and honeymoon which Ned Beatty experienced when on that river trip at the hands of some sick, hillbilly ridge-runner goons. Both science and politicians would benefit immensely. Yes: citizens should work together to see that science and politicians compulsorily enjoy the bliss of such a backwoods wedding.
