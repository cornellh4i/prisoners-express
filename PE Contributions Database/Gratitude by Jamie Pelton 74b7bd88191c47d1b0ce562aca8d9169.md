**Gratitude by Jamie Pelton**

Another word for gratitude is grateful. Some people often feel ungrateful when they should feel grateful. I want to express a time when I felt grateful despite another person’s ungratefulness. Before I begin, I will give a brief history of myself. In 2001, my wife Becky and I lost our daughter Cheyenne to foster care. The family preservation worker almost hit our seven-month-old daughter in the head. Becky cheated on me with another man believing that my telling the truth was the reason we lost Cheyenne.

In 2004, I was arrested for a Class X Felony that I never committed. A Class X felony is the most serious felony in Illinois. I received forty-eight years. The Illinois courts knew that I was innocent and fought to keep me from being locked up. Anyone reading this would say that I have no reason to be grateful. I have now served thirteen years and I am grateful for many things.

At my sentence hearing I sat next to a young and beautiful lady while we waited for the judge, the young lady told me her feelings of ungratefulness. She was taking a plea deal for two years, and the way she saw it, her life was over. I was grateful to see a beautiful woman before I went to prison. I was grateful to see her beautiful hair and pretty face. My life was not over. I could enjoy life still and I was grateful. She asked me what kind of time I was looking at, and I said “six to sixty years.” She was a little more grateful after hearing my response.

A month or so later I was on a bus headed to prison. I sat next to a young man who had to serve a lengthy prison sentence of two months. How ungrateful you have to be to actually be upset with 2 months! As he groaned about his sentence I looked out the window. I would be sixty-eight years old the next time I could look out a window like that, unless I proved my innocence. I was grateful for the chance to see the cars and cornfields. Not the guy with two months, his life was over. When I told him I had forty-eight years to go, he shut up. I have twenty-eight years left and my daughter Cheyenne turns eighteen in a little over a year. I am grateful that Jesus Christ gives me hope that I can reach out to Cheyenne and one day prove my innocence.

I hope other inmates in other prisons will become more grateful for the little things that we do have. In gratitude of all of the Prisoner Express staff I end this word theme, but to any prisoner reading this I ask: are you grateful or ungrateful?
