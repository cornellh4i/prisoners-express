**Change by Jack Simpson**

The thing about prison is that not just anyone can come here and make it. I have seen the hardcore killers and the wannabes become no more than a puppet on a string. People say the good and young die early. It is as true in public as it is in here.

I include myself in all of this. After all, I am here. The first thing in life is admitting you need help. The second part is hard for others. Seeking help for the change you need. Not everyone wants to correct their past. It isn’t being hardcore. I call it being a fool.

After over thirty years in prison, if I never changed then this should be my home. When I came here, I was a thirty five year old hot head. Felt like the world owed me something. My lifestyle would have left me dead from a heart attack. Fast food for a fortpace person.

I could even see myself sitting on a fat, slow moving, out of breath, and most of all, wanting food all day long. Slowly I was killing myself with hamburgers.

When I ended up here, my lifestyle changed and I lost weight. Started to walk a lot. Felt good about myself.

I believe change is not just necessary. It is a must in all who want resilience in their life. Just like Forrest Gump’s mother said, “Stupid is as stupid does”.
