"Girl On Bench" Brian Lowe

Nothing to do or even want to do. Just lounging around enjoying the weather. But wait, something is amiss. I am down to the last drag of my last cigarette. What a bother, I’ll have to find a way to get some more. Should I bat my eyelashes at that perv behind the counter and whisper, “I forgot my ID, can you let me make it this time?” Or should I steal some out of my Mom’s purse and risk an imminent beating if I am caught again.

Whew! I mean nonsmokers don’t know how truly good a puff off a cig really is. The risks a person would go to, to keep a steady supply at hand. Especially if you’re like me and the government passes dumb laws to hold you back, like you have to be eighteen to smoke! Bull! They just want more for themselves.

The truth of the matter is that I wouldn’t make it through the day without a smoke. I have this crazy teacher in Algebra, Mrs. Owens, who is like a hundred years old and takes it out on anyone who is young. Misable old lady. Or my gym teacher, Ms. Hamby, who stares at me during class like I’m some kind of greasy burger on a fast food commercial. Fat bag, she needs to diet! You see what I’m dealing with here! Man, I need another one. Not in a minute or later, but right now.

I’ve got practice in a couple of hours. I had better stroll on down to the store and work my magic or I am going to have a headache all evening and if that happens, I might as well skip. I can’t put up with all that cheer crap when I’m not feeling it. Well I guess I have to get on it or be stuck out. Wait a minute…, “Hey douchebag, I mean dude, come here!” Just my luck, one of those dorks that can’t function when they look at me happens by. “Me?” he stutters. “Yes, you. Come here now.”

“Huh…” he mutters.

“Close your mouth. Do you have any smokes?” I purr.

“Smokes,” he says.

“Yeah, cigarettes, duh.”

“N...o, no”

“DO you know where to get some, anywhere?”

“N..o, no” He stutters once again.

I bat the eyelashes, “Not even for me?” Dorko thinking for a moment then says,

“I can get some from my grandma... “ (Jackpot!!!)

“Well hurry up and go get me some, at least a pack.” Big smile on my part. He asks, “What’s in it for me?”

“I let you talk to me, didn’t I? Now hurry up, I don’t want to wait long.” He trudges off with a determined look.

Well, I might even be nice to him for a minute if he comes through with a pack of smokes. I have to cultivate this source, in private, of course. I can’t let it be known that I talked to or hung out with one of those guys. And a steady supply of smokes from someone I can control. Yes, it would be worth developing this further.

Boy, it is so stressful trying to maintain a constant supply of cigarettes! The things I have to do. It’s hard work thinking up ways to get people to do stuff for me and to give me what I want. Well, that’s the price I have to pay for being a goddess! It’s not easy maintaining this! It is such a nice day, things are looking up, so far I have not even had to move. This is the life. I could like totally be alright with being a cat. Sunbathing, doing whatever I want to, not answering to anyone. Yeah, thats me for sure.

Am I going to practice? Probably not. It’s too good of a day to miss and plus I look good out here. I can see people watching me… That just goes to show that I got the stuff everyone else wants. Men want me, women want to be me. It feels so good to be wanted, even if all they are going to get is a look.

Anyways, where are my cigarettes? If he takes much longer or if I have to go looking for him, he will regret it for the rest of his life. He could have had this! Who knows I might have given him a chance if he would have come through for me. He better hurry, I am getting all stressed out waiting. Talk about jonesing!

Have you ever just watched the patterns in the leaves that the wind draws? It’s just as cool as watching the clouds form shapes. They are both from the wind. Maybe the wind is trying to tell me something? I wish I had a smoke, then I could watch the wind write me a letter in its smoke.

*The idyll thoughts of a young, self-absorbed, self-centered, shallow woman show just how great the era of our youth can be. The center of attention, everyone look at me. So sweet the ignorance that fades as you grow into adulthood.*

*If only she would not try to grow up faster.*
