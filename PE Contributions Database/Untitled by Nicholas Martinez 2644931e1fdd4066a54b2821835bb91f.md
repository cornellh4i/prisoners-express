****I see these mountains and wonder, “How many people have went up and over these mountains? How many people have lined up on the sides of them once upon an ancient civilization? What secrets do these mountains hide that remain undiscovered? Can I have enough faith someday to command these mountains to move apart or shrink in size, so as to let me take only a couple of steps and be on top to conquer these great geographical monsters?” Other questions I have are, “How did these mountains get there in the first place? How long have they even there?” I guess that I tend to wonder when I see great things in the world that we, as humans, will never fully understand. Striving to “know” is something like everyone’s climbing a mountain, never actually reaching the peak of this mountain of knowledge, because as they say, “You can never know too much.” There’s too much knowledge in the entire world that no man or woman will be able to know everything there is to know in one single lifetime. When I look at these mountains, I see great challenges and a different outlook on life. Even when we are all gone, these mountains will remain the same, waiting on someone else to come and take in their beautiful views and to ponder their wonders. So my question to you now is this: have I opened up a gateway to your mind to seek what this mountain view asks of your imagination?
