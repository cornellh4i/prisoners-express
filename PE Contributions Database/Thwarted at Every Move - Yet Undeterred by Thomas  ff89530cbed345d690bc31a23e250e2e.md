**Thwarted At Every Move - Yet Undeterred**

As an imprisoned social justice advocate, I’ve never been popular with custody staff. My sense of right, and justice is inbred into my genes. Add a life sentence and a paralegal degree - well I’m a prison’s worst nightmare.

As a child, I could never tolerate bullies, nor mindless excuses from adults who’s only answer to questions was “because I say so!” I was precocious is an understatement. I was smart, and opinionated, yet never disrespectful. I demanded to know why things were done in illogical, irrational ways - yet no one questioned the idiocy.

I brought this attitude with me in 1995, when I started this prison Odyssey. My first fight was over deadly medical care. From the filing of my first grievance, heads of departments would do their best to thwart my efforts. Either by losing the paperwork; threats of abuse; or totally irrelevant responses. Any tactic to prevent me exhausting administrative remedies. As a prerequisite before judicial action is sought, you must exhaust.

For years, California DOC has thwarted every effort by inmates at for prison support organization. Even when we would get a court to side with the inmates, and order changes, the prison would fail or refuse to comply. For 20 years and over 200 federal court orders to reform medical care went unheeded. Flat outright refusals to obey federal court orders. All while hundreds of prisoners suffered unimaginable torture from disease and pain easily treated. So many died awaiting basic medical care that finally the US supreme court intervened.

The supreme court was so appalled at the stubborn refusal to follow lower federal court orders that even the most conservative justices were moved to intercede. A statewide federal receivership was instituted over medical care. For several years medical care improved. Then as the federal courts eased up oversight - all that progress has unraveled.

Today, at my prison, they employ doctors who have zero ethics if human decency. Men who have severe health problems requiring lifetime, expansive medications are declared cured by these doctors. People are again dying.

When us legal beagles file to the federal receiver or class attorneys now we are told it’s merely a difference of medical opinion. That it does not rise to the unconstitutional level. How appalling. Our advocates have sold their souls to the prison industrial complex. Money has been spent to buy off those responsible for oversight. Lawyers for the inmates are a fiduciary duty to the prisoner/client. A duty to justice, humanity. Yet here we are back at square one. Once again, California’s prison industrial complex has thwarted justice and the constitution.

I hope a new generation of social justice advocates comes up soon to take the place of legal beagles like me. I’m close to parole, old, sick, broke down wheelchair bound. Yet I have no regrets. For I fought for what’s right! All that matters is to fight the good fight for what is right!

Save us lord from the corruption in our state and federal government.
