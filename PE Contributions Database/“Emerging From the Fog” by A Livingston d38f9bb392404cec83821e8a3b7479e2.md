**“Emerging From the Fog” by A. Livingston**

I was enclosed in the fog of my mother’s womb in a weightless world of mystic intrigue. I didn’t know what to make of it all. It just seemed that everything was provided for me, all my sustenance which only consisted of food and oxygen; I was very comfortable and all seemed well until one day or night- I’m not quite sure which- a light began to emerge in sight. I felt a tug and then a sharp pain upon my buttocks as my safe cocoon of comfort came to an end. I knew not what awaited me, but I was soon to be in for a rude awakening.

I partook of the nourishment of the milk from my mother’s teats for a season, then experienced something different and unnatural. Only to find out that the unnatural was much sweeter and more of a delight, and you’d best believe I’d fight to keep partaking of the sweet, though it was more unhealthy for me. I was in a fog and didn’t even know. As I sat on my eating chair and ate some green looking mush that I did not like at all and grew more until I knew the difference between likeable and unlikeable, I was emerging, and though I didn’t recognize it at the time it would become more and more clear. As I entered my preschool years it seemed as if I was always disconnected from whatever was going on at the given moment due to my mind being in a fog. I was always looking off in space as the teachers would often tell my parents. It always seemed to me that there was something of more importance than what was at hand at the given moment. There was a different world somewhere where there was no madness or anxiety, no frustration or fear.

As I entered my adolescent years in school I still looked off in space, but with the help of mind altering products of the natural and chemical makeup, which added to my fog ladened mind. Round and round I went as if on a merry go round, door after door of opportunity came and left as I refused to reach out and embrace the blessings in disguise, and now here I sit in this modern day prison system called a correctional institution here in Florida being cleared of the fog of a free society that once enshrouded me.
