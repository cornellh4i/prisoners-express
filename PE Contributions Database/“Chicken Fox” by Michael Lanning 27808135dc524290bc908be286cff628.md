**“Chicken Fox” by Michael Lanning**

I’m a fox in a pen of mentally deficient chickens that are unable to distinguish between a predator and one of their own, this is a fine game for a fox with a sense of humor.

Every day, all day long, I weigh the adolescent chickens with my eyes, furtively test their firmness with a friendly touch, breath the enticing fresh scent of their twink body selecting among them as if choosing packaged poultry at a market.

Now take a gander at the chicken I have here. That’s what I call a chicken, and I am a chicken fox.
