**"Breakfast" by Shannon Richardson**

What do you think of when you think of breakfast? Does it give you a sense of good things or bad things? Do you believe that it is indeed the most important meal of the day? I don’t know about you, but for me, it depends on the time of my life and who I was with.

Breakfast for me as a child bought a sense of terror. I had to avoid flying glass as my daddy and stepmother fought while trying to stay away from my stepbrother who molested and raped me. I also had to avoid my daddy so I wouldn’t make him angry and get the belt. When I was around 7 years old, breakfast became the most peaceful part of my day. The step-devils moved out and daddy left for work before my alarm clock woke me up. Eating alone was okay with me because it was peaceful- and it didn’t hurt.

When I became a mother, I swore my children would have a better life than I did. They were the center of my universe. Breakfast seems like such a small thing, but I knew how important it was. I would get up crazy early to get breakfast ready and then get them up early enough for us all to eat as a family. We laughed and enjoyed being together. It was the perfect way to start a day. How I long for those days again.

Now that I am in prison, breakfast is like a combination of a concentration camp and feeding time at the zoo. We are told when we can eat, what we will eat, and how much we will eat. However, just like in the zoo, not all "animals" follow the rules. Some want to fight against the rules. Some want to fight each other. Some want more food and risk going through the line twice. Breakfast in this environment is anything but peaceful.

To me, breakfast is about more than food. It sets the mood and tone of the day. It can help to build you up or tear you down. Most people see it as just another meal, but not me. I know why breakfast is the most important meal of the day- and it isn't nutritional.
