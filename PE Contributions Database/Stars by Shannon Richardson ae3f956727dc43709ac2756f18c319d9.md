**Stars by Shannon Guess Richardson**

Stars are absolutely and undeniably beautiful. They are infinite in number, and as much as we learn about them, there is so much more to learn. What do you think of when you look up and see a sky full of sparkling stars?

Growing up, I was abused by my alcoholic father and step-brother. My earliest memories are of being abused. Most people could go to their mother for comfort, but mine abandoned me when I was 2 years old. What I did have were the stars.

As a child, when I needed comfort, I always looked up at the stars and imagined something or someone out there who truly cared about me and didn’t want to hurt me. The stars became my source of comfort. No matter how horrible the abuse was, star gazing could instantly calm and comfort me.

As I grew older, I stopped fantasizing about who or what was up there, but that didn’t take away the effect the stars had on me. When I need comfort, they are always there for me.
