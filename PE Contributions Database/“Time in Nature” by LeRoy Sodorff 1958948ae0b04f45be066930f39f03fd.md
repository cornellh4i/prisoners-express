**“Time in Nature” by LeRoy Sodorff**

Trickling from a mountain top

To a steady stream tree-lined

Where flora and fauna dine

Here in the landscape of my mind.

Where balance and rhythm

Are in a constant motion

That stirs the emotions

Such a soothing potion.

For this stream of consciousness

Becomes a relentless giver

To this life liver

As it turns into a river.
