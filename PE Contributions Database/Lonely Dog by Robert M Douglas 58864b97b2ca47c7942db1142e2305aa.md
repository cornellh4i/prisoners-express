***Lonely Dog* by Robert M. Douglas**

I’m just a lonely dog. It wasn’t by choice, but my habits and addictions I could not control. I was in a cage for so many years being fed through a slot that free I don’t know what to do. I know before I was caged, I wasn’t a lonely dog. I ran in a pack, enjoying our wild adventures. That was until the day I was put in a pound by the park patrol. Who would have known a game of hide and seek would lead to me being in the kennel for ten years? I guess it was my time to leave cause they put a band that beeps constantly on my hind leg. I tried to be what I was before but it seemed as if every day I was fighting a dog in the pack. They must have gotten tired of me cause they forced me out. I’m so lost, confused, and dazed that I was caught once again. To prove it, they even got a picture hours before I was back in a cage.

This is my life as a lonely dog.
