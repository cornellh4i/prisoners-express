**“Recording a Memory” by Sean McCarthy**

Many, many years ago, my first child was welcomed into our world. How frightened life had become knowing nothing of our world. I was merely fourteen years old. What had I done? This child of mine will grow in a world of hate and resent me for his creation. Will he grow to become violent and abusive as his father and his father’s father? All I want to do is show him love, and my adolescence would not cloud his growth.

Back home, in the hills of what they now call Tahoe, things were simple. Life was simple. My family had lived there for as long as time itself. So much blood lived in the soil and ran through the river. Dancing on each leaf of each tree rest an imprint touched by our ancestors that will never be forgotten. Oh, how my child would have loved to become a man in that world. With each breath, he took so much spirit that would have drowned his soul with existence.

Why, husband, did you force us away? The gentle suckles of his lips upon me bring comfort and help ease the chaos running through my body. He feels so warm and safe wrapped within my arms. He feels of no worries. Only soft sounds are heard as he nourishes himself with the milk from my body. This moment between my soul and I assured me that life will be alright here in the big city. Yes, it will be rough at times, being away from our family, our history, but husband has shown much growth in himself, proving his love to us. This is a good thing because by this winter, yet another child will be in my arm’s gazing into my eyes wondering what life brings.

Thirteen children, twenty two grandchildren, six great grandchildren and two great great grandchildren later, fright still surrounds my thoughts. Not as much now as before and not for the sake of my family. The world has become what it has been destined to become. This wonderful world will soon be a memory for me. My old bones have been through a lot, and any old tree in the forest knows when it’s time to fall down. I’m thankful that my leaves have flown off and away so to start their own trees. May they land in nutritious soil to flourish in. As for me, my day’s are done.

Back some time ago, in the big city, a friend came along one day to introduce us to, what she called, a video recorder. It was an odd looking thing, and I wanted nothing to do with it. She then goes on to explain to me the meaning of the machine, and it intrigued me. After a few demonstrations of her scanning the living room then playing it back on our television set, I decided to give it a try. It was a heavy little thing and had far too many buttons to remember. Quickly, I fell in love with the new machine. It’s not quite like my husband's old camera which only snap’s one still picture at a time. It now saddens me that we never purchased one of those video recorder machines; my family in the hills would love to see its wonders.

For the past few months, the bones I’ve been given have hurt too much to move around. Without husband here anymore, it became pointless for me to carry out the daily chores. Now I know why we bore thirteen children: if not for the love then for the help. I’m tired of laying around in bed all day. These are going to be my last days, and my visions of our world have slowly become erased. The last thing I want to remember is the ceiling in the bedroom, white, pasty, and lonely. What I do fondly remember is that damn video recorder and how I always has to close my eye to see through the machine. What a marvelous memory catcher it was.

The mind, what a crazy adventure. With the few memories of the video recorder left within me, more come flooding to life with the simple thought of having to close my eye. I need more memories. The journey outside was a tremendous trek but one that needed to be taken. Standing on my porch, back against the door to hold me up and facing the hills where I grew up, my left hand covers my left eye. The world goes black all around and only sounds of life invade my mind. My right eye opens to allow light in, and then my head begins to turn to the right, then to the left. Capturing all of the images that go by: birds flying, children playing, clouds evaporating, tree after tree dancing with the gentle breeze and then the sun warm, warm sun fills these aching bones with a few more minutes of life. Just enough time to record and remember. The right eye closes, and the video recorder is turned off. Live on, memories.
