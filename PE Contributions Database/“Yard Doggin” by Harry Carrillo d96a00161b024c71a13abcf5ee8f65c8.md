**“Yard Doggin” by Harry Carrillo**

When I was a boy, our family had a dog named Spuds. We named him after Spuds McKenzie, the bull terrier mascot for Budweiser.

By Kings’ decree (King of beers, that is), McKenzie was the royal ambassador for alcoholics everywhere. His party down antics were the biggest thing in anthropomorphic peer-pressure since the chain-smokin-slickster Joe Camel.

Like the famous McKenzie, Spuds had a black patch around one eye and a pure white coat. We were best friends, Spuds and I. Everyday when I’d come home from school, spuds would be waiting in our front yard. As soon as he’d see me come moseying up the driveway, he’d start yipping and yelping, jumping all over me before I could get through the gate. But I didn’t mind. Spuds and I grew up together, in a way. But as I grew slowly between the second and third grade, Spud’s growth was not so subtle. He grew from an adorable pup into a Mangy Scoundrel with hyper-sensitive labido. He began to hump anything he could wrap his scabby forelegs around; legs, trees, other dogs, tires. You name it. Spuds saw the beauty in just about everything. His fluid brand of sexuality was all inclusive and knew neither preference or bounds.

One day Spuds decided to follow me to school. I grew up in a small town and letting your kids walk to school was as natured as leaving Ice-tea to brew on the porch. By then however Spuds and my relationship was strained. He made me uncomfortable and I didn’t trust him because his intentions were always naughty. Turning on Spuds with rocks and insults, I tried to drive him away, but Spuds was a bad, bad boy.

After a twenty minute standoff I realized if I didn’t hurry I’d be late for school. I ran to class, ditching Spuds somewhere in the parking lot. By the time recess came, I forgot all about the drama with my dog. The bell rang and a swarm of screaming kids ran for the playground. We lined up for a game of dodgeball when someone yelled “Look a doggie!” To my horror I saw Spuds trotting through a gauntlet of head-patting, ear scratching children.

Then a scream.

Kids scattered from Spuds like flies shooed from a piece of rotted fruit. What I saw I’d never be able to forget, no matter how hard I would try. Spud’s legs were wrapped around the waist of a boy I knew from class, humping away like a hell hound possessed. It was brutal. Spud’s tongue hung from the corner of his mouth. Each thrust poked the boy’s pant leg with what looked like my Grandmother’s lipstick. I had to do something.

“Spuds, No!”

But it was too late. Girls were running and screaming. Boys were pointing and laughing. I charged at Spuds menacingly, breaking his hold on the humiliated boy, who was bawling. Spuds quickly set his sights on a girl named Ruby and was on her like a shot. Ruby’s eyes went wide with terror. She made a desperate break for the monkey bars, hoping to gain the high ground, but in vain.

Spuds latched onto her leg and Ruby shrieked so loudly that Spuds howled, as if he’d heard a siren.

“Damn it Spuds, No! DOWN NOW!”

I tried to be severe, threatening even, like my father, but all that came out was a pathetic weeze.

Ruby shot me a murderous glance. Her brown eyes flashing behind a wall of tears. Ruby was crying, but not because she was sad, or even ashamed -- she was pissed.

“IS THIS YOUR DOG???” she screeched, trying to pry free from Spuds Roman-Greco grip. I denied owning Spuds with the conviction of St. Peter denying Christ to the Romans.

“Hey”, shouted an anonymous snitch. “That’s Harry’s dog!”

“Nuh-uh!”

“Yes it is!” confirmed my best friend Ralph, who I learned that day wasn’t a friend at all.

The mob is a terrible thing. They came in different shapes and sizes, races and ages, and for different reasons. But there is no mob as vicious as a mob of angry children. Some older boys rescued Ruby and drove Spuds away, doubtless impressing her with their Ninja Turtle courage. Then someone tripped me and sat on my chest while kids took turns stuffing sand into my mouth. But that indignity was nothing compared to the shame Spuds brought down on my household. A few months later, my mom backed over Spuds pulling out of the driveway. I can’t prove it, but I think she had a few beers before she started the car. In a cruel twist of fate, the same inspiration that gave Spuds his name would end up killing him. A bit of K9 Karma if you ask me. But the damage was done. I got my ass kicked a lot that year, thanks to that damned dog.

I’d like to think of Spuds in some sort of doggie hell, chased eternally by feral cats and vacuum cleaners.

But every once in a while I think of the dog that would wait for me to come home from school and beg for a belly rub. That’s the dog I miss, not the horny mutant he grew into.

Rest in peace Spuds, and watch out for tires in hell. Damned dirty dog.
