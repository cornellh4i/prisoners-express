**Finding Inspiration by Lauren Shepherd**

I find inspiration in the world around me. People I meet, the good, bad, and ugly, teach me things I need to know about myself, my life, and the way I see things and do things. I walk outside and see the snow on the mountains, the hawk that flies across the rec yard, the chill in the air and it reminds me to appreciate the beauty in the world and the peace and serenity of nature. The books I read take me to far away lands and inspire me to think, create, dream and never give up hope that all is well. My mom inspires me to be who I really am, my grandmother inspires me to be honest and real, my dad always taught me to feel my emotions because they are valid. I inspire myself to keep on going when I look back and see how far I have already come, and I know that is not as bad as it used to be. I am inspired by the officers who have watched me grow, the inmates who have walked me through that growth and all those who have become teachers of my better soul. I am who I am because of what has inspired me and I pray to be an inspiration to one who is where I was, so I may pass on all I have learned to someone who needs to learn.
