**“Blink of an Eye” By Brandon Seward**

“In the blink of an eye”- a game winning shot could pass through the net making u the queens of basketball, now that’s some Catholic power.

“In the blink of an eye”- you can go from being the hero of the Super Bowl, to throwing a crucial interception on the 1 yard line, now everybody hates you, and you turn instantly into a zero.

“In the blink of an eye”- a bullet can travel through a window, a door, or a building and kill an innocent unsuspecting bystander, when in darkness of the night guilt weighs heavily on his conscience and begin thinking foul, he then rips up his sheets, all to right his wrongs

“In the blink of an eye”- a juvenile can look at her cell phone, all to read an unsuspecting text, too completely distracted from her driving, and run right into the side of a school bus while unconsciously killing herself

“In the blink of an eye”- a jury of 12 can dictate one’s future, all by having one’s world in their hands, when 6 feel and understand mercy, but the other 6 is influenced by the prosecutor’s manipulatives education, i mean the commonwealth make 100,000 guaranteed, and the court appointed $366 per case, is this a case of justice or prison profiteering?

“In the blink of an eye”- Wall Street could collapse, stocks could plummet, millionaires and billionaires would then understand what the Average Joe/Jane endures on a everyday basis, flipping burgers/ being underpaid school teachers, or maybe they’ll take the easy way out and jump off the rooftops, going back the the Great Depression days, when people are the real investment

“In the blink of an eye”- a moment of passion could turn into a robbery of innocence, as the monster aids flows into your fertile blood stream, all because a condom wasn’t available

“In the blink of an eye”- your mom could die from an undetected bump in her breast, as tears so desperately ran down your face, i can relate, it’s everlasting pain, as your whole world rocks, your pain spins without the axis, meaning your world has no rotation, direction, order, nor balance

“In the blink of an eye”- you could develop a strong sense of hatred towards a parent, who told you no to extending your curfew/ increasing your allowance, so you invade their gun cabinet and revamp Columbine, Pulse, Sandy Hook, Parkland.

“In the blink of an eye”- 2 planes can crash! On the side of a building that kills thousands of people, when the war gets brought to NYC, when Nas and Alicia Keys do concerts for free, do you not understand that’s a 9,000 mile trip? All for one moment of bragging rights, however if someone invaded your country and stole oil from your people or dropped a bomb on your people could you call this karma? Because none of us choose where we are from or look like, our teachings mold us into who we turn out to be.

“In the blink of an eye”- we could all unify to change these manmade false perceptions of how we view life, by getting the knowledge. For ourselves, insteads of being misled into groups not designed for us, only to use, or to disenfranchise us from one another, when behind the veil we are all the same.

“In the blink of an eye”- we could stop killing unarmed men/women whose only weapons were cell phones, skittles, cigars, traffic tickets, hoodies, BB guns, or making cigarette sales.

Well it was actually something missing (the thought) I thought he had a gun! And they justifiedication c’mon man you see how they act in the movies right? I mean lets be serious they live in shit holes right?
