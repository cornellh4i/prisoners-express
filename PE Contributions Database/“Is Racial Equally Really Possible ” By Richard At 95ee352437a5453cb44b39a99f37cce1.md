**“Is Racial Equally Really Possible?” By Richard Atkins Jr.**

Equally? Or equality? Well, my answer to both is no and yes! ‘Cause it’s human nature to relate to people who look like us. So that’s my answer to my no. My yes answer, comes from the people who are interested in other cultures.

For example, I date and make love to all women, no matter their race. That never plays a part in my sexual attraction. Now, when it comes to running my company, I prefer to hire my own people and that’s possibly the thinking of white people. Especially those who are racist, blinded by ignorant teachings. I’ve met skin heads while in prison, who spoke from the heart while in solitary confinement, who told me that their parents didn’t teach them racism...prison did.

That blew my mind on every level, and had my brain confused, and what he told me was, he came to prison and chose to support his race and their views.

On the other hand, I wasn’t B.G.F, but as a crip, I felt it my duty to associate with my people, as a black man and as a blue rag representative.

There wasn’t anything in my mind or heart thinking race. I just simply understood that, I was to walk the line beside my people, especially the crips.

So, racial equality is possible and it isn’t. It all depends on the situation I believe.

I was born in Stockton, California, a city that populates many nationalities and my friends were of all races. My mother and father never taught me to dislike other races. They taught me to never ever dislike my own race. And with my father being a Black Guerrilla Family member, I was taught that black was power! And that black was beautiful like my mother.

On television, I see shows on CBS, like *Big Brother* and the show *Survivor* displaying racial inequality and I believe it’s unintentional.

For example, there’s always just a couple color folks, whether black, Asian, Cuban, etc., and the minute one of those minorities speaks out of line, it places a bullseye on their back immediately!

Watch them shows and seasons and latest ones and the pattern is there. I’ve been watching them shows on CBS for almost a decade now!

Now, like I stated earlier, I don’t believe it’s intentional. I truly don’t. It’s just a normal reaction on those contestants’ minds, due to identity.

I’ve seen a few minorities try to build alliances, it never worked out due to them being minorities...inside the game. The odds have been to great to overcome in the *Big Brother*’s house and on *Survivor*.

Is racial equality possible? No and yes!

On elast example. Ben Carson made some wicked comments during his run. Donald J. Trump also made and still makes wicked comments and see the outcome?
