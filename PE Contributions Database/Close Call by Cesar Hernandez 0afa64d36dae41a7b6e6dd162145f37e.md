**Close Call by Cesar Hernandez**

I know my fiancee is not going to be happy if I tell her I got Krystal pregnant. My friend Krystal is very regular when it comes to her monthly cycle. If she’s one day late, she knows something’s wrong.

I’m reading the Wall Street Journal poolside when Krystal calls me. She tells me she’s late. I tell her she should have woken up earlier. She says it’s the other kind of late. I put down my skyy martini. She says she’ll test herself in a couple of days.

I don’t tell my fiancee that I may be expecting a child with Krystal. A few days later, she calls. She’s positive. I tell her I’ll be right over. My friend Krystal is a bit of a prankster. I need to trust but verify. I stop at CVS to purchase a pregnancy test. The clerk puts the test in a brown paper bag that says CVS. She puts the paper sack in a plastic bag. I don’t understand why they have to hide the pregnancy test in the paper sack.

I arrive at Krystal’s house. She texts me that the front door is unlocked. Krystal is wearing some very nice dark green lingerie. She always looks good in green. She asks me if I recognize what she’s wearing. I tell her I bought that for her. She says it looks great on her. I say I agree.

Krystal is overjoyed that we’re having a child. I tell her to hold on. I give her the CVS bag. I grab her by the hand and lead her to the bathroom. She accuses me of not trusting her. I tell her I need to trust but verify.

It seems like the test takes a very long even though it’s only a couple of minutes. She is so happy that it’s positive. I’m not. She already has our entire future mapped out. She says our daughter will be named Alyson. If it’s a boy, our son will be named Edward. Krystal says I can move into her house today. She says I need to call off the engagement to my fiancee.

Krystal doesn’t want our child to be born out of wedlock so we’ll be getting married next month. She says we need to take CPR and other classes before the baby is born. We need to go to Babies R’ Us to buy things for the nursery. We need to go to Barnes and Noble to buy parenting books. We need to go to Two Peas in a Pod to buy maternity clothes.

I have no idea what to say. Krystal is an eight and very intelligent. At the same time, I have no desire to marry her. I don’t want a child with her.

She leads me to her kitchen. She pulls the Grey Goose out of the fridge so we can celebrate. I tell her she’s pregnant. Finally, she tells me she got me. She says the pregnancy is going to be terminated. She’s not ready for a child right now. I’m courteously relieved. I’m not going to have to marry Krystal.

We drank the entire bottle of Grey Goose. Since she’s already pregnant, we don’t have to worry about her getting pregnant again.

Afterwards, she says she has an appointment the next day. I give her my American Express card. I say I’ll accompany her to the procedure. She says she’s a big girl and doesn’t need me to hold her hand. I tell her I need to trust but verify. After the procedure, we are glad the close call is over and done with.
