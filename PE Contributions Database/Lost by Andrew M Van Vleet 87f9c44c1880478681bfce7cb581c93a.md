**by Andrew M. Van Vleet**

Who am I? What have I become? I hardly remember what brought me this. Every decision and moral compromise I made changed me further from myself. I’m lost in this man I’ve become. Can I find my way back? Remembering every twist and turn that brought me here was like a metamorphosis. Can a butterfly change into a caterpillar? Maybe I can’t go backwards, but hopefully, I come full circle. Maybe I’m not so lost after all.
