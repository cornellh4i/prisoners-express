**“New Normal” by E.J. Jernigan**

As seasons come and seasons go; all that’s left within is a sense of yearning for the pros each present and an eagerness to escape the cons. I’m always ready for what’s to become the new normal, yet at the same time dreading it so. And, of course, always assuming that there will actually be a next season to bring a new normal.

Like the sun during the times of daylight saving, the days of autumn were disappearing far too quickly while the scales of my life were being dominated by the weight of woes.

I started thinking that I was in dire need of getting away. I couldn’t even recall the last time I had allowed myself to indulge in any type of rest and relaxation beyond a cup of coffee and a smoke on the back porch just before plunging head first into a long day’s work. So, ignorant of the fate that such a thought had sealed, all was decided and my mind was made up. I set out on a journey of solitude in the wilderness of which my only companion would be mother nature herself. My hopes were high set on obtaining an experience of serenity.

Having lacked any type of desire to travel beyond the city limits I was born and raised in, I had never previously contemplated any places that I would like to visit. I wasn’t exactly sure where I should go, so I decided to chase someone else’s dream: my beloved father’s. Life cut him short of doing so. I came to Montana.

Being unequipped with skills for survival in a wild territory didn’t slow me down, not one bit. I came seeking an experience of a lifetime and nothing was going to stop me from doing so.

I spent my days exploring the open range vigorously and watching birds. I swam for hours at a time in the same lakes that I pretend to know how to flyfish in. I slept under the stars and reunited with my inner-self through sessions of meditation in the midst of the warmth provided by campfires. I was living as though I was born for the lifestyle. This adventure had definitely presented a new normal unlike any I have ever known, or even imagined at that.

After a few weeks passed by, the autumn days became cherished memories of the past and the new climate of winter quickly replaced them. Dark gray clouds covered the skies and were the only indication of peril that I recognized. The last few days have proven just how fast sugar can sour. Conditions become harsh. Not just for me but for nature as a whole.

It all started when an unexpected blizzard came rushing out of the north, migrated in, and covered the red clay with several feet of snow. It was by far the most I had ever seen outside of the Home Alone movies.

As I began to navigate the unknown amount of miles back toward where I left the jeep I rented, I noticed what appeared to be a small group of dogs off in the distance. The reason why I noticed them so easily was because their movement was a first besides the wind and myself in the vicinity for three days. I kept making my way.

As I began to navigate the unknown amount of miles back toward where I left the jeep I rented, I noticed what appeared to be a small group of dogs off in the distance. The reason why I noticed them so easily was because their movement was a first besides the wind and myself in the vicinity for three days. I kept making my way.

The snow seemed to be packed tight enough to sustain the vast majority of my weight. Until all of a sudden It didn’t. Catching me off guard, a fatigue stricken step sank deep into the snow. The freezing temperatures numbed the pain of the impact. After I pulled my foot out of the hole and planted it into that first step, the pressure proved to be too much. I collapsed right there. My ankle was shattered into pieces.

Once again, a rare movement caught my eye and I looked up. That group of dogs had closed in and had me surrounded, except they weren’t dogs at all but wolves. Wolves that were snarling viciously, foam dripping from their mouths. Despite how cold it was outside, as I concentrated on the dark wolf in front me, perspiration seeped from my brow. One wolf lunged from my left and sank his teeth deep into my neck. Complete darkness took over. An unexpected next season. A new normal with a peace like never before.

**“ Full Moon Shining” by E.J. Jernigan**

It wasn’t an easy defeat to accept. Though none of us would admit such, the hunt was over before it even started. No amount of eagerness or determination would have balanced the beam for me nor my kindred.

We navigated through several miles of knee-deep snow before fatigue set in. Even then, we didn’t abandon the pursuit purposefully, but with each of us needing to catch our breath, the pace dwindled drastically. By the time we ran out of the forest we were topping a rise that gave view to an endlessly open snow frosted field. The only evidence that we were on the right track were the human shaped footprints that stretched beyond sight.

The cause was lost. The cold blooded monster had bested the pack. For the time being anyway. The thrill of killing in such a perilous territory would lure the bloodsucker back, and with each passing day we were maturing more and more. We will be ready.

As a wave of realization washed over me, I lifted my snout skyward, toward the full moon’s shining, and let out a sharp howl Into the distance. The rest of the pack chimed in with me. A warning that said return at your own risk. With a deep sigh, I lowered my head and crunched my way back to the village.

Most people have the opportunity to live life on their own terms. To be this or to be that. If you would like. Not everyone though. Some aren’t as fortunate. Some are born for a singular sole purpose. At first this was a harsh shot to swallow. I was selfish and didn’t care anything about humanity as a whole. Constantly I asked myself, why me? I mean, who wants to be a slave to destiny?

That’s not a confession of being completely heartless, though. I had just given it wholeheartedly to my life mate, Lydia. The only time I wasn’t selfish was when it came to her. To say that I loved her doesn’t convey the half. So naturally when the murder rate hit an all time high and claimed her life with it, something in me snapped. The pain that I felt from the loss was indescribable. It was a pain that nobody should ever have to endure. A pain that spread throughout society at a far quicker rate with me denying my role in the grand scheme.

I realized that somebody had to bear the burden so I accepted myself for who I was born to be. At all cost, it’s my responsibility to protect the living from the murderous walking dead. I started running with the pack and doing my part to exterminate the creatures of the night, yet my mind was still distracted. The numbness that I had slipped into was by far better than the initial shock and pain but served as a barrier that divided me from anything that felt normal or joyous.

A month passed by and the climate grew brutally cold. Snowflakes were falling from the sky in rapid succession. Though I possessed the ability to shift into my wolf body, the conditions still made for exhaustively challenging hunting. A debate warred inside my mind as to whether or not I wanted to brave such elements. Just as I was leaning toward staying in, I overheard an elder warning another hunter to keep an extra close eye on me. Tonight’s targeted cover was responsible for Lydia’s death. No way could I sit this one out.

Once we located the scent and were hot on the trail, I felt a buzz and had forgotten I even existed. Through an opening In the canopy, a shining of the moon highlighted a slight movement of shadow against the white snow. Softly planting my paws, I crept in that direction. I was dead set on avenging the only person I had ever loved. As I made my way around a thick oak I caught sight of a vampire feeding mindlessly. With a rage that would fill Bruce Banner with envy, I lunged at the monster, sank my teeth deep into his neck, and ripped it off his shoulders. The immortal being had killed for the last time.

Releasing my jaws, the head fell to the ground and rolled half a turn. I looked up into the sky, past the falling snow at the moon, and released a long howl in victory.

Right there underneath the night sky, deep within, in a place that I had closed off, I felt a portion of myself that hadn’t been present since I lost Lydia.
