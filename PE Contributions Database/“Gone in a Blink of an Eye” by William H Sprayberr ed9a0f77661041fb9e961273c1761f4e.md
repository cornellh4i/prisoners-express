**“Gone in a Blink of an Eye” by William H. Sprayberry Jr.**

Most life changing moments happen in the blink of an eye. Things will be going pretty smooth; we think we have everything under control but then life does what it seems to do best — throw a curveball that sends us off course.

Like a batter that chases an errant pitch, when we get thrown our curveball, it usually doesn’t end well. In life, we can’t just stand there and wait for the next pitch and hope for something better. In life, a lot of those blink of the eye moments are forced onto us, they change us forever.

A woman isn’t feeling her normal self, so she goes to the doctor to get a check up. “I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this,” he says in a phone call later on that day, “but you have cancer”. Even in the rarest of instances where she beats it, her life has just changed, in the blink of an eye.

What about the little boy whose mother puts him in the crib, and goes to sleep. The next morning when she wakes up he is deceased. SIDS is what they say happened; suddenly all those late night wake ups when the boy would cry, seem like precious memories. She would give anything to be able to hold her little boy once more.

I had a friend named Mindy Mitchell. One weekend, she was hanging out with me and some other friends at my house. A couple of weeks later, I got the tragic news, she’d overdosed on heroin. I didn't even know she did heroin. A few days before she overdosed, she’d called me and said she needed a place to stay, but because I was trying to work things out with my girlfriend at the time and knew it would cause problems, I told her I couldn’t help her. When I think back on all of it now, would she still be alive if I’d have given her a place to rest her head? I’ll never know, but that is probably the part that hurts the worst. Never knowing causes guilt. I wept at her funeral. I thought whatever she was going through, everything would be okay but it wasn’t. In the blink of an eye, heroin took a wonderful person from the world and changed the lives of everyone she knew.

One of my best friends, Josh Duran, and I got into a dumb argument over a female. It seems so stupid and insignificant as I think back on it now. A while after this happened, a mutual friend told me she’d talked to him and he’d told her I was mad at him, so he was obviously pretty bothered by it. Being the hard headed guy I often seem to be, knew we’d eventually talk about it and be friends like we’d always been. I ended up in prison. Then my granny told me about the car wreck that had taken his life. I got the clipping from the newspaper in the main, but we never were able to apologize. One of the best friends I ever had went to his final resting place with us not on speaking terms. I thought there would be plenty of time but in the blink of an eye all his time was taken away. I had to tell him I was sorry through a prayer. I can only hope and believe he received that prayer, I believe God shared it with him up there.

Life happens so fast as it is. Today, we is all we have; right now we are here but what about tomorrow? How hard would it be to apologize to someone you care about and swallow your pride? How hard is it to help someone in need? I promise you it is easier than it will be if you blink your eyes only to open them and be robbed of the chance of being able to do so in the future, because they are gone. Sometimes it really hurts to blink your eyes, so if you have a chance to lessen that pain, do it, before it is too late.
