**“Blink of an Eye” by Jack Simpson**

This will show things change here if you don’t keep your eyes wide open. There is always a calm before the storm. Just like a storm before it builds completely, you can feel the tension in the air. You notice how the feeling in the air changes. Like the hair stands up on the back of your neck.

Just an example, people start to gather around and a lot of whispering goes on. Then, the air changes to a high pressure in the dorm. That is when you notice something is about to go down. Most of the time we have a couple who want to keep trouble stirred up.

I call them troublemakers. They like to keep lies stirred up about people so they will look good. I also call these fellows short timers. Soon, just like a snitch in here, they end up on a slab in somebody’s morgue. That is the way of life back here.

One day you may be talking to a friend that you have known for yours. All it takes is for him to get in debt and can’t pay. He is either taken out or checks in. Sooner or later, his debt will get paid. Either with his life or someone will pay it once to keep him from getting killed. I’ve even paid a fellow’s debt off once and told him this is your first and last time for this.

Six months later he was stabbed to death for the same type bill. Some people won’t leave the drugs alone. That is the normal sense is to stop. Some have to stop with their lives. I have been down twenty-eight years. Not once I have let drugs or alcohol take control of my life. I guess I love myself too much to be a slave for another.

Everything I had on the street was gone in a Blink of an Eye. But it was not drugs that did that to me. It was just my own stupidity. Sometimes we get wrapped up in our own little world that we forget what is really important to us all. I wanted my cake and to eat it too. Forgetting about the responsibilities I had to my wife and kids. Now it’s too late to correct the past. In order to live life true, we all have to learn from our mistakes and go forward. Not to make the same mistakes over and over again.

People like myself have taken life for granted. Then when they say the crap hits the fan, it is too late then. Why not correct one’s self before this happens?

I tried to correct my past and go forward. At times it is hard. To sit and think about all that was lost. I hear people tell others it isn’t fair. But what is that way in life?

Even if I had the world it all could be gone in a blink of an eye. Or should I just say to be happy and content without drugs has made me a better person now.
