**"Road Trips" by Thomas Soria**

I came to prison when I was nineteen, so road trips for me were always with my parents for the most part. My childhood was abusive - mentally, spiritually, etc. Good times were not really the norm, and the few good times we had were usually tainted with arguments, yelling, throwing objects, slamming doors, and so forth.

However, for some reason, the road trip tended to be different. I don’t know why. Maybe it was the escape from our normal environment. Very rarely was a road trip tainted, at least in my memory. When it came to the road trip, it was like there was a camaraderie, a common goal that united us.

Some of our trips were the three of us, while others were just my father and me. Some were planned in advance, like going to Great America in San Jose/Santa Clara for my birthdays; others were spur of the moment. “Let's go to Tahoe!”, a two hour drive at 11 o’clock at night. Or sometimes we would go back and forth to Reno for a summer.

The trips to Tahoe in the middle of the night were great. It could be a school or a work night, it didn’t matter to us. My parents would go to the casino and I would stay in the arcade. Luckily I never got challenged by staff because you have to be 18 to be there after a certain time. Ha! When we finally returned home it was after dawn and none of us were doing anything but going to sleep.

Road trips for vacations could be a little stressful, but I think that’s normal. Plus, once we were on the road, we were usually calmed down. For one of our vacation road trips, we ended up on the news. We were on I-50, but it ended up snowed out because of an avalanche. We, along with everyone else, sat there for hours waiting for the roads to be cleared. Finally, the authorities told us we wouldn’t be moving forward any time soon. So, we had to turn around, get back to Sacramento, and head up I-80 instead. At the chain/snow tire checkpoint, there was a news crew speaking to drivers about the situation and they stopped at our vehicle. It was great! We finally made it to Tahoe at around midnight, tired but happy to be there.

There were a few road trips that I took alone, like going to Napa to see a girlfriend. However, the destination and seeing her were more important than the trip itself. One trip from Napa with the same girlfriend is still one of my best memories. It’s nice to remember her and that road trip. She is one person from my past that I definitely miss, despite the mess of that time.

No matter what the road trip was however, one thing was almost always a constant for me:

An escape from the abuse.

Not to mention the absence of arguments (most of the time). The road trips were an enjoyable part of my life. Often filled with music (we would take a tapecase full of cassettes), singing, and conversation. Maybe this is why I enjoyed just driving.

Now, as I sit in prison with a life without and in the hole at the moment, I have something good to think about. There may not be much that’s good from my childhood, but I know there’s something. And if there’s that, there may be more. I just have to remember.
