**“Railroad Tracks” by Anthony Kenley**

Man! Seeing these tracks brings back memories. These tracks could be through my old Arkansas woods. They ran about fifty yards from our backyard. Going who knows how many thousand miles either way. So many times we daydreamed of hopping a train even if it only went to the next town down the line. It would have been easy to do but the consequences scared us too badly. What if we went and couldn’t come right back? Then we’d have to call. That was not going to happen, I’ll tell you. We used to follow the tracks if we were walking to town. We were always on the lookout for fallen telegraph poles so we could get the cool glass insulators. We collected a few. We’d pick up old railroad spikes and bring them home like treasure. The first time I put a penny on the tracks for the train to flatten was a memorable experience. About a hundred cars went over that penny. It was so flat and spread out so big. I was thinking that’s so cool. I ran over and picked it up off the rail to show my brothers. I lost several swirls of fingerprint doing that. Hmmm! Millions of tons of weight and friction equal heat, who knew?

There were two bridges on the way to town. One was a little wooden bridge we’d jump off of into the creek below. The other was a high metal one over a langer creek. Oh we dared ourselves to jump from that many times, but we were chickens.

We’d try to come up with ideas of how to actually ride the rails. Riding our bikes on the rails was a project. Rims with no tires just weren’t wide enough. A cross bar leading to the other rail was an idea so we’d have our tires on one rail and just peddle like normal.

We spent hours and hours roaming those rails. The highlight of our day would be to see an actual engineer waving from the caboose at the end of a train disappearing down the rails. I’m still lured by the rails. I’d love to ride them around America.
