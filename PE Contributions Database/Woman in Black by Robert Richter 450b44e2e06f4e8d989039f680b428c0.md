**"Woman in Black" by Robert Richter**

We will never know who they were, who took the picture, or what happened. Moments after this picture was uploaded onto the web, the entire area was obliterated by a massive truck bomb then overrun by IS. The national government that had prevented this kind of atrocity was nowhere to be found, having been bombed out of existence by NATO. It was a simple strategy, really: destroy something so that something worse can step in.

The complete lack of interest this picture drew around the world doesn’t surprise me. This has always been the case. Nobody wants to be confronted by the consequences of their actions. A three-year-old boy, washed up on a Turkish beach, draws worldwide attention because the direct cause of his death was the impersonal sea, allowing the guilty to think, “It’s not my fault!”

Who is that faceless woman? Is it his mother, sister, or wife? We will never know or care. All we see is two more faceless victims of our bad choices, and so we choose not to see them at all.
