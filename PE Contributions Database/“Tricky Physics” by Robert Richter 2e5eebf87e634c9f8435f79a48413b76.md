**“Tricky Physics” by Robert Richter**

With a cloud chamber, we can watch particles as they move through a magnetic field. Opposite charges curve in opposite directions, protons one way, electrons the other. The sideways force Is proportional to the particle's velocity through the field: Double the velocity, double the force; reverse the velocity, reverse the force. This is both simple and completely wrong. How can the wrong equations work so well in practice? Start over,

At what velocity, relative to what does a free charged particle remain at a constant distance from a straight current-carrying wire? Moving in one direction, the free particle curves toward the wire, In the other direction it curves away. When it is at rest, relative to the magnetic field, There is no force. This is not correct either! Here’s the trick: What is the velocity of the field? Traditionally, and for practical purposes, it is assumed that the “moving” electron current In the wire creates a “stationary” magnetic field. Why are the protons ignored?

The free particle experiences a force proportional to its velocity. What then are the forces on the particles In the wire, and how do they relate to the free particle’s velocity? When we add those two forces together, we have to get the same answer as the force the free particle everything must add up and cancel out. Traditionally, physicists just pretend that there is no force on the protons. Pretend physics, anyone? They imagine that the electrons are moving through the magically stationary field from the free particle. Imaginary physics? Magical physics?

The force depends on the square of the velocity. We have two velocities, two fields, two forces. There Is an attractive force between electrons and protons, and repulsive forces between like particles. Were we to add linear forces, we would get F=-V+(V-d) =-d ??? We- see F=Vd, where V Is the free particle’s velocity and d Is the electron drift velocity In the wire. There are In fact four forces, p-p,e-p,p-e, and e-e. The term for each one Is squared. Each term must be multiplied by the number of particles on each side. With parallel wires, we have four velocities, all relative to some observer, A,B,C and D. e,p,e,p.

Our four forces are thus A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D. Each term must be squared. When we add it all together, we get (A-B)(C-D)=yd! [I will send you the full math on request. I’m leaving It out since Pe Isn’t set up to publish super- and subscripts.] The four forces seem to be a single force that Is the product of the two currents. The reality Is that a “magnetic field” Is an overlap of positive and negative fields moving relative to each other. Tricky physics indeed! Physics is a specious religion!

Suppose that I have a wire in a magnetic field. Running a current. Why doesn’t a thinner wire produce more force? Half as many electrons, moving twice as fast, should produce twice the force, and it does! However, there are now half as many protons as well. Identical parallel currents give us F=0-1-1+0. (Terms are p-p, e-p, p-e, e-e.) Make one wire thinner and we get F=0-2-½+½. One of the forces does double, but another Is reduced, and the electrons now repel magnetically, since they are moving at different velocities. The total force is the same. Tricky!

The early experimenters couldn’t think about the protons or electrons. They hadn’t been discovered yet. Their belief In “a” current tricked them Into using the wrong equations. This is why no physics has been able to unify the four fundamental forces. The most basic and “well understood” part, electromagnetism, is completely wrong. There is no Higgs boson, no reason for one. The Higgs is a hoax! My correct understanding of electromagnetism allows me to derive mass and energy from charge alone. I do real physics.

You don't need 14 billion to figure out why particles have mass, you just need to think. Why am I the only person who can do this? Are you all just badly programmed chatbots? Hello? I am apparently the only rational human being. Hello?
