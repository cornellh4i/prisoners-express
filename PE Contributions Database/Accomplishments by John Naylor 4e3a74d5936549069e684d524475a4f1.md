**Accomplishments by John Naylor**

Someone asked me a most bizarre question lately. They wanted to know if I was compensating for something like poor character through being driven to achieve. It seemed an odd question. I’d never heard it before. Perhaps it’s because I don’t have all the answers. As Clint Eastwood once said in a movie “Tough ain’t enough.” I know tough won’t get you through a college career if someone decides it’s convenient to arrest you or serve warrants on you because you won’t tell them what they want to hear. That can destroy your life, even if you don’t know what they're asking you to co-operate about. I know that just fighting to keep your hope and faith is an accomplishment. Enriching others lives is an accomplishment. My academic advisor at ACU used to tell me to never give up on some type of further education. Even if it wasn’t at ACU. So I’ve got a lot of Bible and rehabilitative certificates, a D.O.C housekeeping apprenticeship graduate is the beginning, not my end. You see, I was homeschooled for many years by my Mom and Dad. Dad used to ask me “what did you learn today?” If I learned something I’d share and he’d listen, adding advice and wisdom. He concluded that any day you learned something was not a day wasted. How many days are left on your sentence?
