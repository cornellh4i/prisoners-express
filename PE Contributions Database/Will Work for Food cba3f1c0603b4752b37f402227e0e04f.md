***Will Work for Food* by Shaun Blake**

At my very first job, I worked because it was fun and because I got fed all I could eat at the end of my project. One week is how long my first job lasted. And I was only 5 years old.

In 1972, my family lived in the little town of Jackpot, Nevada with a population under 1,000 people, enough to operate the three small casino-hotels, a banquet hall, a small grocery store, two gas stations, an elementary school, a local government, and the requisite children.

One of the strangest things about Jackpot was that it didn’t have kindergarten or any daycare. With most adults at work and the other kids at school somewhere, my best friend Dee and I were both five and were left to our own devices.

Jackpot was about to have a new church, The Restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (not to be confused with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--Mormons). The Restored Church built their chapels in a “barn-raising” way: all the able-bodied members did the work without outside professionals. At the construction site, Dee and I showed up every day to watch the work, and being hyperactive, inquisitive 5 year olds, we asked a lot of questions and generally got underfoot, pests in other words. Instead of shooing us away, these nice people answered our questions by putting us to work and teaching us the things that they were doing.

Dee and I ran errands and messages, held materials, and carried tools... anything to help out. Our main job turned out to be installing insulation in the small, cramped attic and underneath the floor where it’s hard to reach. Dee and I ended up doing this simple work with only a single adult to supervise us. Installing insulation is itchy work. After the first day, Dee and I were rash-red, but fortunately, my father knew that cold showers, calamine lotion, and a pair of coveralls to wear during work would remedy the itching. It was something to get used to, and soon, the small chapel which seemed big to me at the time took about 10 days to complete building.

When the building was completed, we got our promised “pay”: a celebration potluck banquet that was an all day event which included several competitions and games for the kids, and a dance at night. I remember the food most: fried chicken, hamburgers, barbecued-ribs, fresh corn-on-the-cob with salt and melted butter, mashed potatoes, deviled eggs, the list goes on to cover all the pastas, vegetables, bread, fruit, and desserts. I ate so much that I got sick, ate some more, and got sick again. A wonderful day! A wonderful memory

Dee and I can claim the title “Youngest Insulation Installers” ever!
