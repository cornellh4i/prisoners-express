"Girl On Bench" by Norris Beebe

Her daily routine landed her in Meadow Park on the square’s bench that overlooks the garden and wet banks. She found the cozy refuge one day while exploring the city of utter chaos. Its beauty stimulated every sense in her body and she soon lost herself in the midst of the mid-spring days.

Day to day, we gather the fruits of our labor. Exhausted by the sweat of our brow, we rarely stop for a moment to notice the pleasure the world displays hidden within a moment. While she enjoys her day, others detour their lives to take part in what is left of our world’s beauty.

Lavished in her own beauty, stunned by her appearance, she settles herself in comfort without woe. Adapted to her surroundings, she rests for a moment to regain her strength for the long journey ahead.

Passionate for life, free to express herself in a fashion within an altered world’s ego, she shows herself freely without hesitation. For it is not her color she chooses to express or her shape that maintains her beauty; nor is it her style that creates one of many characteristics of her personality. She is just being herself, sassy and forward without fear.

But she wonders, what is her purpose in life, her meaning, her contribution to the world? Is life just a game of fate, or is life a choice we make? Do we choose the path we take or is our path just a chance that changes from day to day? Or do we just endure a Monday through Friday, nine-to-five job to create normality? Do we withstand normality while we seek what is said to be our “true passion”?

What is love? Is love an almighty power or just a feeling? Do we love to live, or live to love? Do we abide by God’s word as He says, “...to love one another as we love ourselves?” Do we live a life we love or is love just an idea of beauty in an insecure world that most want and need without option? Beauty?! Who is to say what beauty is? Does beauty come with a cost? I have to answer yes, a huge cost!

Many questions, few needs, and an abundance of confusions plague the mind of the intriguing young woman. Still, peaceful and content, she falls into her spell and is enchanted by her beauty as if she were on the other side of the mirror gazing at her reflection.

With just a glance, one could define her by the various colors she wore in an exquisite disguise. Another may absorb her thoughts, judge her choices, and debate her actions that brought her to this particular place in life. Others would ask, “Why would she stop here to rest? Why would one choose to reveal and express her elegant smooth curves that flow without restriction?” Only the angel can look upon her with eyes of innocence. Pure, taintless, and without fault.

Could it be her eyes of dark glee that enchant us? Shaped to attract the lustful with lashes that flurry with every wink? Could they pierce a path straight into the core of our soul, taking a glimpse of what we cannot reveal? What expressions she renders lost in deep thought. As she returns to reality, she catches the shadow of an angel’s wings.

Her thoughts begin to diminish as the cool breeze lift her strands and swishes them about. Hesitating to rake them away, she stares onward. She gazes not out of fear, but to ponder what may be her next deed.

Does she not realize that a storm slowly creeps upon her? Does she not feel the cool air flow through the follicles of her silky hair? Does she not notice the sun’s rays being diminished by the oncoming clouds of deep gray? Is she not afraid of the evil of her world?

Unlikely. On this day, her beauty has calmed the beast.

What is her next step? Where does she plan to go? When will she step outside of her domain to encounter her final destination? Will the storm wash her away into the river waters below or will she seek shelter for this night?

Crashing rage of the distant river waters rush on as the endless existence of life prevails beyond the weathered banks. But where water attracts life, life attracts death and death ultimately results with new life. All around us, no matter where we search, we find life continues cyclically. Time continues to pass. Where we go from here is at our own free will.

With the name of a lady and wings like a bird, she comes out of her shell showing her world that things are not as they may seem. Will she make her glorious flight just to rest on another graceful life form? Will she charm another beast and enchant with her devastating beauty? We will never know for time is precious she must move on.

She creeps forward slowly seeking a higher altitude for her soft silky skin. When a crack in her shell separates and her wings unfurl, she reveals her full abilities to all who gaze upon her. In that moment, the cool breeze excels and she takes flight. In an instant she is gone and the lady bird begins a new chapter in life.

What beauty life brings unexpectedly to a female sapion in lure on a park bench after an exhausting pursuit with the loves of her life: dance, performance, and the beauty of expression. She watches as tiny life forms live without worry, only to become overtaken by worries of her own. What will she accomplish within the new sunrise?
