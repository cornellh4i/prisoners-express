**Accomplishment by John Frederick**

I was born and raised in Georgia primarily, my parents worked in the construction business and pretty much traveled all over the United States with me and my three sisters. I always felt like an outcast and never really accomplished anything except getting into trouble.

Now getting into trouble was fairly easy for me. It seemed like all I had to do was wake up and I was either getting whipped or yelled at for something I had done or was accused of doing. That in itself was not the accomplishment or an attainable goal. I never really accomplished anything worthwhile until after I was incarcerated.

The first year of my incarceration was a living hell, I had no patience and really did not care about anything. I was nineteen and had just received a fresh 99 year sentence in the Texas Department of Corrections, at the time I could not see any corrections being made or really didn't want to see any except pure hatred for the system. I wound up in Seg. for almost three years and really grew to hate everything around myself.

During an out of cell recreation on the Seg. yard an old man started talking to me about life and what it meant for him to be alive. I seriously thought the old guy was nuts and only paid attention to half of what he said. He asked me about my education and I stated that I had quit school in the ninth grade and was not interested in school. He chuckled and let it go as he explained that he had been in and out of prison his whole life, but had just gotten his G.E.D. at almost seventy years old and it felt good.

Later that night, I began to think of the things I had actually accomplished in my life and really could not come up with much that was of value to anyone including myself. That was in or about 1986. Now, almost thirty years later I look back on my own life and describe my accomplishments to these inmates coming into the system with their attitudes and ignorance.

During the past thirty three years of my life I have remained here in prison without being released or ever leaving the system. During that time, I can proudly say I have received my own G.E.D, received numerous on The Job Training Certifications and am working on my Applied Science in Automotive Technology. My certifications include, certified welder/fabricator, sewing machine repair specialist, sandblast booth operator, spray paint booth operator, certified two stroke/four stroke OPEESA–EETC, diesel mechanic and at this time I am classified as a teacher's aide diesel mechanic in the windham school district diesel vocation.

I may have started out with nothing to be proud of, but thank god for that crazy old man on the rec. Yard back in the 80’s. I have a god given talent for maintenance repair work and use it everyday that I am alive, yes, that is an accomplishment.
