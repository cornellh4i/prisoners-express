Grandparents by Robert Bartlett

I knew two grandparents. My paternal grandfather was Lewis Diman Bartlett. My maternal grandmother was Hettie Mitchell. Uncle Paul was the only person I heard who called her Henrietta.

James and Hettie Mitchell came from Northern Ireland. He died before I was born. Hettie’s maiden name was Moore, as was my paternal grandmother’s, but they were not closely related. If I ever find an honest judge, I will try to learn more about my paternal grandmother.

My grandfather lived in Milton in a big white house close to one of the last stops on the Green Line. That far from the center of Boston, the train ran above ground but was still referred to as the subway. He had a big summer house at Billington Sea in Plymouth. It was not far from my family’s house, but only accessible by miles of dirt roads or by water. It was on a good size lot, but the hill was so steep only a small area was actually usable. The soil was sandy and the outhouse only stank in the summer weather. Most of the lot was densely wooded, dominated by pitch pine with a few scattered scrub oaks and a little undergrowth.

My grandmother lived in a second floor apartment above her oldest daughter. Both apartments were laid out almost identically. I was in Auntie Anne’s apartment unit a few times, usually only briefly, but I spent a lot of time in my grandmother’s.

The kitchen was fairly big with a table and chairs. The dining room was generally off limits. It’s door was kept closed. I occasionally got a look at the beautiful china, silverware and silver tea service back there, but those treasures were not to be touched, much less eaten off of.

The stove was big with a flat top from which a wire tool could be used to remove iron disks, with flames underneath. A big glass bottle was mounted above the fire, containing several gallons of kerosene. That made me nervous. When she made me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, she would always put butter in it. I didn’t like that, but I loved Grandma too much to say anything about it.

The living room was open to the kitchen. If it had a door, I don’t ever remember it being closed. In one corner was a beautiful wooden cabinet. When the doors were opened, a small TV screen and controls were revealed. My grandmother watched Billy Graham whenever he came on and several daytime soap operas. Tea was occasionally taken in the living room, but most of the activity in my grandmother’s apartment took place in the kitchen.

The bathroom was fairly big and well lit. There was a box mounted above the toilet. One pulled a metal chain to flush. When I was little, it was hard to reach.

The bedroom door was usually open. Grandma’s chamber was clean and neat. The bed was made as if no one ever slept in it. I don’t have any memory of ever going in there.

There were porches across the front of the building. Annie’s was enclosed by glass. Grandma’s was open to the air. It was close enough to town that one could occasionally smell the ocean, but we seldom went out there.

As she got older, stairs became a problem at our house and hers and elsewhere. Then they became an architectural barrier and her children put her in a nursing home. Annie also moved into a ground floor apartment under cousin Anne.

My grandfather had been a successful banker through the depression. He had diabetes for many years until he left a substantial inheritance to each of his six children. There was much discussion about the distribution of assets, some of it which was unpleasant. My grandmother passed away in a nursing home at the age of approximately 104.
