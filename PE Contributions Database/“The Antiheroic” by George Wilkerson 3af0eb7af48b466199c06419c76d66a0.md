**“The Antiheroic” by George Wilkerson**

****There come times in our lives when we are tested, when circumstances conspire to reveal our character, when events converge and we find ourselves at a crossroad. This was one of those moments.

I had just exited the multipurpose room, where we had our Bible study, when I noticed Chaplain Dunston had several men clustered around her. They weren’t touching her, but they were pressing in on her threateningly, and she was pivoting side-to-side with her back to the wall beside the elevator, warding them off using sharp whispers and choppy gesticulations. Despite something being afoot, I decided to keep my head down and mind my own business.

I swerved around them to turn down the hall opposite the elevator, putting the scene behind me. Though by then my spiritual high flagged, I was determined to ride it as long as possible. I was halfway through the hundred-foot hallway when:

“George! Help me!” I flinched at the shrill tone stabbing into my ears (and conscience). Reluctantly, I slowed and stopped.

“GEORGE!” I turned around. The chaplain was standing on her tiptoes, trying to see over the heads of the men, having to hop-hop to clear the tops of the tallest. As I moved toward them, all their eyes screamed various warnings at me. I ignored them.

“What’s up, chaplain?” I asked from perhaps twenty feet away and closing. A couple of the men peeled away from the pack, shaking their heads and, right before we collided, they hooked a sharp left up the stairs. There were still two others. As I approached, they fanned out to either side, giving me a clear view of Mrs. Dunston. A tragic, delicate sound emanated from her direction. She was wounded and looking down.

“George...it’ll die if you don’t help me.” I traced her gaze to the cricket she’d been shielding. Now that I could see it and the fact it was missing a hind leg, its chirping did sound like a distress call.

I suppose my posture revealed something to her and my remaining Christian brethren, for she sighed while they shook their heads mournfully and made their way to the stairs, muttering mockingly.

I hate bugs. Well, maybe “hate” is too strong a word, and I definitely wish them no harm. Nor is it exactly a phobia, though the thought of them crawling on me makes me shiver. It’s more an aversion - a visceral revulsion.

“It won’t hurt you.” Easy for her to say. How come *she* wasn’t scooping it up? It was right at *her* feet, not mine. As if sensing my thoughts, she backed away to give me plenty room to make a fool of myself. I figured, he’s only got one hind leg - how hard can it be to catch him?

A lot harder than I thought. See, he was bounce-bounce-bouncing around, frantic and unpredictable (due to his lopsided catapult system). Besides, I was trying *not* to squash him. My left hand clenched my Bible, and my other hand I shaped into a cup. I squat-hopped around the hall, attempting to herd the cricket into a corner. The best I could do was usher him toward a wall.

After a minute or so, I dripped sweat; and I was a bit annoyed with the chaplain’s frivolous encouragements: “Oh! Get him! Get him!” And, beneath the stare of an amused and bemused officer, I was somewhat self-conscious.

So I got serious. I took a deep breath, tucked my Bible under my arm to free up my hand, and spoke softly to the cricket. “Hey, little guy...calm down. I’m not gonna hurt you. Look, I don’t know how you got in here - maybe you made a wrong turn, or were tempted by the warmth and bright lights - but you made a bad decision. I’m trying to save you and set you free.” I also sent an emergency prayer flaring into Heaven.

Within seconds I had him cupped between one hand and the floor. I felt him ricocheting off what must’ve seemed like prison walls. To keep him from popping through the brief openings between fingers and floor, I brought my other hand into action and created a loose basket. Cradling the cricket, Mrs. Dunston and I, heads held high, marched over to the recreation yard door. I shouldered into it. *Locked.* We twisted around to find the officer. Who, with a facial expression saying he couldn’t believe how idiotic we were, spat, “You can’t just walk out there anytime you like. There are gun towers. If I had the door opened without first calling them, when you stepped out you’d be shot.”

To be honest, I didn’t see it as such a risk: crack the door, reach out, drop cricket, shut door. The gun towers guards wouldn’t even notice. He knew it too. “No! I am not going through all that trouble just so you can rescue a cricket.” He stomped away before we could reach him with reason.

The chaplain and I met eyes. Our spirits slouched. “Just set him by the door. Maybe he’ll escape next time it opens,” She said, dejected; and seeing no other option, I obeyed. With regret, I put him down gently and apologized, “I’m sorry, buddy. I did all I could.” Then we three parted ways.

I was fifteen or twenty feet down the hall when Mrs. Dunston called out, “George!” I stopped and spun round, a question on my face. “George, why did that happen?”

“What do you mean?”	“Why would God allow that to happen? Why would He move our hearts to help a cricket, only to have a locked door stop us like that?” There was a deep, plaintive note to her question.

I fired off a bullet request for wisdom, and cocked my head for a second as I waited for God to answer…”Chaplain, God wanted us to understand He values the life of every creature. No matter how big or small, they are precious to Him - and ought to be us as well. Not only that, but success is not determined by outward results but by the heart. God called us to act, we obeyed. We were successful in service because our hearts were in the proper place and we did our best. The outward results are up to God, not us. We are called only to obey.”

She was near tears as she nodded. We both walked away simultaneously sad and uplifted.

Reminiscing like this, I can’t help but notice the parallels between the cricket’s plight and mine, complete with people of a higher standing in society struggling to help prisoners without knowing whether they’ll be “successful”. Nevertheless, they sense the call and compulsion of compassion in their hearts, and relentlessly sweat to save lives while the world watches - indifferently, bemusedly, indignantly, mockingly. On the surface, they seem to be regular human beings. It’s only when they are in a crisis, or become aware of a problem, that we see their capes streaming as they fly into action.
