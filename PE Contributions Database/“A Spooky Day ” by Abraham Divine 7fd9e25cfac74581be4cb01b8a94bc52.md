**“A Spooky Day?” by Abraham Divine**

In 1952 a group of army soldiers went missing. Although they did not disappear all at once. They disappeared one by one. It was if someone or something was picking them off, was an enemy out to get them? Who knows what actually happened to those men.

The soldiers were all from the same small town, and grew up together, went to school together, even worked at the same job.

They were all good men though it seemed. Did they have a past that they told no one about? Did their past come back to haunt them, to stalk them, to kill them even?

At last on late July first, 1965, all the army soldiers bodies were found in Maui, Hawaii, six miles past the hot springs at Baker Mountain, near Black Sand Beaches. It was a joyous day, but kind of sad for all the soldier’s wives, because they had to bury their husbands. To do an autopsy was unneeded, by just looking at the bodies you could see that age was the killer indeed.
