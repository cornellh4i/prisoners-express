**“My First Raffle” by John Naylor**

My mom used to shop at Frank’s nursery and crafts in Anderson, Indiana back in the 80’s and 90’s. One day, the store decided to do a raffle for a stuffed toy for the kids. It was 1991, as I recall. My brother and I signed up, and I figured he’d win before I did. He was in the fourth grade, and I was in kindergarden on to first grade. Well I took the train from Anderson Christian School to our real rural home, but all our doors were locked. I slept in that train. We waited hours. No one was home. I was too small to use adult solutions, and no one had cell phones back then except CEOs. Eventually someone pulls in, and they’re in tears. Poor momma. She thought I’ve been abducted. Come to find out I was supposed to wait on my family at school and not take the train that day. Well despite all the upset, the driver waited faithfully. He made sure I was safe, and on top of it all, I was told I’d won the raffle and that the stuffed toy was mine. I was really surprised; we picked it up before they closed. It was my first win of anything like that. The store clerks heard the story. It was like walking off of a missing poster and into the winner’s circle. It was off, foreign and surreal. The clerk was more excited than I was, I think. I was happy but in so much shock from it all.
