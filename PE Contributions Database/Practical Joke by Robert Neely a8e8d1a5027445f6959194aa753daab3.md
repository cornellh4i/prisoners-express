**"Practical Joke" by Robert Neely**

Like a cliche, we’d always pick on each other in my large family. My sister, Jasmine, and I would terrorize our two little brothers and our youngest sister, Billy, Juanito, and Elena.

We lived in a small town in Missouri called Jelamon. It was humid all the time, and the winters were harsh for a kid originally from New Mexico. The summers would make you sweat without even moving. It was a great place for snakes, and our yard was a breeding ground for garter snakes. You could get handfuls if you didn’t mind being bitten a few times. Jasmine and I were were a daring sort. The first week of school was great. We could walk home from school and have a half hour before the kids get home.

We found an old coffee can with a plastic lid. As they got off the bus, we asked, “Guess what we got?”

Elena, knowing our propensity for chicanery, was hesitant, “What is it?”

“A bunch of snakes from the pond. Do you wanna see?”

“No, I don’t!”

Billy and Juanita crept up. Janine and I looked at each other, she pulls the lid off as I “toss” the snakes at them. They all scream, but the can was empty. Oh, their faces were livid.

The very next day, Janine and I spent that half hour gathering as many snakes as possible, and we got 23 of varying lengths. When they got off the bus, eyeing the can sitting between is on the porch, Elena asks, “What do you got in there? A bunch of snakes,” in a sing-songy voice.

We said in unison, “Yeah!”

We threw the whole can at her, and the boys laughed. Billy chased them down and was never scared. Juanito ran away to the neighbor’s house, but Elena--she froze. She couldn’t move. Janine and I finally felt sorry and cleared a path for her. Coming home from school was traumatic for her the rest of the school year. She also has never forgiven me. Interestingly, though, she doesn’t drink coffee.
