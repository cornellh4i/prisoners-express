**by Raymond Swanson**

When I was young, my mother would take me to a friend of hers who had a small boutique in a small town not too far from our home in northwestern Pennsylvania. I remember it was a two story brick building with a covered porch balcony that reached the curbside. Also, an 18-inch wide gap between the brick buildings creeped me out a little.

When the shop closed, we began going to another friend of my mother, and she would trim my hair and give my mom a perm. Eventually, the shop closed, and my grandfather would buzz my hair.

My grandfather was in the Army in the mid 1950s and started a family soon after. He had an admirable work ethic and loved his family, which I only realized as I became older. He was also an avid woodsman and fisherman, and he would compare my thick hair to that of a sheepdog when he was trimming it down in his backyard, cellar, or kitchen. I didn’t always want to get a haircut, though just sitting in that chair always brought a lesson. These are memories I now treasure.

I didn’t think much about my grandfather’s haircuts when I was younger since I thought I had better things to do, but as others started to trim my hair, I began to miss that crispy old towel over my shoulders and around my neck. What I wouldn’t give to have one more haircut at the hands of my grandfather.
