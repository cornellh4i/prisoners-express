A faint sound of the alarm from the room next to mine filtered the air. Beep- Beep- Beep was all I could make out over the crickets screeching in the early morning blues. Its cool breeze came to brush my face through an open window with a fresh bloom of pine. The creek’s flow rushed its water within its banks searching for the ocean sur. The moon glistens of glamour, embraced the twinkle of surrounding stars without a cover of cloud. How nature can show its beauty, though she could also express her fury….

Early a.m. came as fast as we closed our eyes. I was awake, ready for the day, but a bit sluggish from the early rise. Nothing was left for a 12-year-old to accomplish, so I wandered out of the back-door to ingest what most people ignore, not realizing what nature has to offer.

It was not long before the creaking sound of the back door opening, Gene. It’s time to go, my grandmother said. Quietly we headed out to the old jeep and off we went. The start of a new day into town.

Our early morning voyage began with a twenty-nine-mile ride from what was called “Headquarters” through Ostrander onto the main freeway to Longview and Kelso. But first was the winding dirt and gravel curves that lay eep into Washington's National Forest.

Its road was narrow leaving just enough space for 2 logging trucks to pass side by side. With its thirty-two curves, enclosed by aged pines and cedar made the trip into town long, slow, and sometimes dangerous. To a pre-teen, our journey became an adventurous hunt for wildlife. Within every curve, some type of life would show its face.

A black bear would paw its way through the woods with her cub or a coon would stand on its hind legs to watch us pass by. A white-tailed doe or buck pranced its way in front of us to duck out of sight. But the ultimate experience was to get a glimpse of a grizzly. Its massive bulk showing its claws leaves an unforgettable memory etched in your brain. Just to see its track sends a shiver down my back. A true killing machine.

The ride to my uncle Bill’s house in Longview seemed shorter than usual. There were no animals in sight. No glowing eyes in our headlights. Not even a bird in the sky. It was strange not to see even a doe or a cub on the roam. No one paid any mind to its silence. All I had on my mind was how many crawdads I could pull out of the creek and who would find its wet bottom floor first.

Before long, we pulled into the dirt drive of what was my great grandfather’s house.When we crossed over the bridge the creek flow showed its white waters as I remembered it. I couldn’t wait to jump in! But the work had to get done first. We were the first to arrive and the jeep needed unloading…

Auntie and Grandma were tending the morning chores. Grandpa and Uncle were at the jeep with its hood up attempting motor maintenance, discussing an afternoon at Spirit Lake, and I was at the creek as life began to settle down. It was there where she appeared in my morning views…

Softly with the sweetest tone of the songbirds tongue, she sang her tone with joyful tempo. She brings melody to all who listens before a new morning’s dawn strikes into the distance. She sings long stunning notes with a radiance that stimulates the senses inside the mind and soul.

Dawn begins to appear. The gleam of the sun’s ray sneaks a peek over the mountain’s crest lighting its path in every direction as I stare on. Its alluring sight slowly moves forward while the evening’s morning darkness starts to pass away. The blends of reds and purples spread the new day of glory upon us all. For just a moment, she shouts a beauty of elegance that sparks song and dance. Nature awakes its inhabitants.

She hops from branch to branch in a tall pine reaching the sight she seeks. The breeze shivers its branches and carries the tune of the songbirds' tone to a deeper whisper of delight while the sunrise matures. And she sings her song without flaw.

Quietly the grizzly yawns with a stretch then step out into the forests open air in search of pondering toward the flowing river. The trout treads its waters feeding off of its catch while the squirrel gathers its find. Soaring above comes the hunt of the hawk providing meat for her younglings, and Bobbie the cat, is on her prowl ready to pounce on her prey. Still, she sings her song with utter perfection…

An aroma of the bean strengthens as the sizzle of crimping pork pops out of its pan. The cracking of the egg and the rising of the cakes blends together to make a beautiful morning rise complete.

All at once, everything went silent. Her song stopped and she disappeared. The brush of the breeze stood still the sound of the creek’s water lost its lure like we were in the eye of the storm. And with a shake of the earthquake came a scream from inside the house. “THE MOUNTAIN!!”

I look toward the house when the loudest explosion I have ever experienced pierced our drums. Frightful disbelief of terror filled the hearts of us all in deep sadness. We scurried to the jeep and as I looked on a mushroom cloud above us filled the blue sky and filtered out the beautiful morning's colors. Lightening with gray clouds covered its blue and thunder growled with every flash.

It was 8:32 am on May 18th in 1980 that Mount Saint Helens erupted for the first time in 120 years. Its eruption was preceded by two magnitudes 5 Earthquakes. Over 60 people were killed, a widespread flooding and mudslides occurred from the ash and melted snow which included our family's home and properties. The surrounding forests were scorched, scattered and devastated. Washington and her surrounding states were blanketed with ash and panic as far as Montana as the nation watched on.

Our breakfast on this day would not be forgotten as the mountain’s eruption interrupted a nation’s morning with vast destruction of floodwaters, ash, panic that would affect the earth and its inhabitants for many years to come.
