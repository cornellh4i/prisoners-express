**by Red Dot**

Red Dot grew up on the East Side of Rochester and was a big money maker on the side. Money mattered less when a friend got killed, and Red Dot began drinking and going to clubs to find who killed his friend. Then, one night, while he was in his spot, two people kicked in his door. Red Dot stood at the top of the stairs and told the two to remove their masks. When they took off their masks, Red Dot couldn’t believe that one was his dead friend. A shot rang out from his friend’s gun, grazing his leg and leaving him lost in thought. He then scrambled up the stairs to pack up his money and drugs then walked over to his friend’s connect, “Go let your person know that the job is done.” Red Dot then shot his friend in the chest and thought, “I can’t trust anyone.” It’s day by day, lost in this world of money, revenge, and snake games.
