**"The Hermit" by D.J. Forbes**

He was known simply as the Hermit.

He lived alone on a tiny little island, which in reality was simply just a patch of rock jutting up out of the ocean covered with a tiny sheet of dirt and sand. This island of his sat a quarter mile off the coast of its parent island, which itself was the smallest in a string of islands located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

This dot of an island was not much longer than was absolutely necessary for a human being to live on. It was even significantly smaller than the square footage of an average sized two story home.

His dwelling was simply a one room shack constructed of four cement walls topped by a slightly slanted roof. The door of the shack faced south, away from his island’s parent island.

Behind his dwelling grew a couple of small, stunted trees. What kind of trees they were, he could not say because quite frankly, he did not care what kind of trees they were.

The fact is, he didn’t care about a great many things.

He did not care whether the sun was shining or it was pouring down rain. He did not care whether it was the middle of summer or the dead of winter. He just didn’t care one whit about anything other than what he called “communing with his thoughts.”

Now, while he didn’t care about most things in this world, there was one thing that he absolutely abhorred: people!

He lived his life in as much solitude as was possible for him.

Once every six months, a boat would arrive to restock his supplies. These were days that he absolutely dreaded. If he could’ve managed his survival any other way, he would’ve, just so he wouldn’t have to interact with anyone, ever!

While he never kept track of time, he always somehow knew when the boat was about the arrive. And the moment he awoke this morning he knew that this was the day. It wasn’t long before the drone of a boat’s motor alerted him of their arrival. He lay upon his sleeping pallet hoping, without much conviction, that they might just unload his supplies and leave without disturbing him.

The sounds of men’s voices assaulted his ears, grating on his nerves worse than nails on a chalkboard. Gratefully, though, a stern command silenced them.

He sat up, trying to will what was about to happen not to happen.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

He did not move, pretending not to have heard them. A moment later, though, they came again.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

He released the breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. Rising, he resigned himself to his fate and made his way to the door, but instead of answering it, he simply stood there with his hand on the handle, giving them the chance to give up and leave.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Twisting the handle, he opened the door just enough to allow him to peer out. Standing there on the other side of the door was a man who, in relation to the Hermit, was a study in contrast.

Whereas the Hermit’s hair was long, greasy, and unkempt; his was short, clean, and impeccably groomed. Whereas the Hermit’s beard matched his hair, the man was clean shaven. And whereas the Hermit apparently wore a series of rags sewn haphazardly together, the man wore a tailor made suit.

His name was Steven and he was the only person allowed to address the Hermit. He stood there holding a simply looking yet extremely complex tablet computer down at his side.

“Greetings sir,” he said in a lovely audible whisper. “We brought you your supplies for the next six months.”

In response, the Hermit simply scowled at him. Truth be told though, he disliked Steven less than any other handler he’s had over the years. Steven always followed the rules of contact to the letter, never conveniently forgetting any of them like some of his past handlers had. And out of all those rules, speaking in a whisper was the most important to the Hermit.

Nodding his head once in acknowledgment, the Hermit tried shutting the door, but Steven anticipated this and slid his foot forward to keep the door from closing.

“I’m sorry sir,” Steven said still in a whisper. “But you have to keep up your end of the bargain.” Placing his free hand against the door, he gently pushed it all the way open. “We provide you with everything you need to live, as well as ensuring you your privacy out here.” He held the tablet computer out to the Hermit and asked, “so what do you have for us?”

Taking the tablet from Steven, his other hand moved almost of its own volition over to the screen, inputting vast amounts of information without even looking at it.

He tried speaking, but all that came out was a gurgle. Clearing his throat, he tried again. “Well, I came up with a way to increase T-cell resiliency, as well as possible cures for those two types of cancer, but I haven’t made much progress on the sustainable cold fusion power generator. So far, I can only keep a terawatt-hour reactor running for two years on a single fuel capsule, so I am not sure if you want me to include that one as well.”

“You know what? You might as well,” Steven told the crazy old genius who was, in fact, the entirety of the Xem Coup Theoretical R and D department, code name: The Hermit. “You never know what might come of it.”
