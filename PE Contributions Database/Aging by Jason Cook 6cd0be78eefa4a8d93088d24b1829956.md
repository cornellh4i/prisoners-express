**"Aging" by Jason Cook**

Aging on this Earth, I have been doing for 26 years. I have been incarcerated if not half, then just about half of that 26 years. I was 10 years of aging on this Earth the first time I went to a juvenile attention center. That went on and off for five years. Then off to (TYC) Gainesville State School, for three years. Then prison, where I have been aging for six years.

I have aged in the world-free about a year and a half before I began my aging in Texas prisons. The free world had been aging without me. So many things and people have aged. I have received pictures of my brothers, sisters, my daughter, as well as others of my loved ones, aging along in the world.

What hurts the most is that my six-year-old daughter Katelyn is aging on this Earth without even knowing her father. Katelyn was born a month and half after I was locked up in the county jail in Smith County -- Tyler Texas. I have only seen Katelyn aging in pictures.

As well, my brothers and sisters have children that I have only seen by pictures. My baby brother and my three sisters that are younger than I have aged so much that I would not even know who they were, once I was released, if it had not been for receiving the pictures that allowed me to watch them age.

Aging has taking my father off this Earth in March of this year, 2004. He had 67 years of aging on this Earth; I felt no love for my father. I always told myself that I hoped he would die. His death touched me to the core of my soul. I know I have many things I wish I could tell him. I have to wait till my aging on this Earth is finished then I will be able to tell my father all the things I wished I could have already told him.
