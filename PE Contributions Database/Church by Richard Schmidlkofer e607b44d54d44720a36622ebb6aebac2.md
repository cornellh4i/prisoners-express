**Church by Richard Schmidlkofer**

It is a building where you can meet people that believe in God.

It is a place for peace and love.

It is a place to learn who God is.

It is a safe place to be in prayer with the Lord.

It is a quiet place to go from the crazy world.

God is in this place. He will never leave you nor forsake thee (Heb. 13:5).
