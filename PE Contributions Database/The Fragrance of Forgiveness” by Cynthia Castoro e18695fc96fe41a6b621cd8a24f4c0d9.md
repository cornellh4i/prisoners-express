**“The Fragrance of Forgiveness” by Cynthia Castoro**

I made a terrible decision on June 26, 2009 to drive home after drinking too much. At the time, I felt capable to do so and I ended up involved in a horrible crash.

I do not call it a car accident because it always becomes a topic of debate. The facts remain that I was not speeding, I did not veer from my lane, but encountered a construction site so poorly supervised that a man, Stephen Dunn, was not provided an adequate safety zone in which to work. Mr. Dunn was crouched down, backward, in an active lane of traffic at 12:15 AM when I struck him with my vehicle. I did not see him, nor could I have if I had been sober, but the facts of my case are not of concern here.

Though I had no police criminal record, over the next two years I would learn that Florida law would hold me 100% responsible simply because I bore even 1% of the blame. An absurd analogy I was given was had I been driving alone down a deserted road intoxicated and if  a 747 jet should fall from the sky and hit my car with all passengers parrishing, I would be liable for their lives as well. I disagree.

Two years later, at my sentencing hearing, the sister of Stephen Dunn, the man who died that night, was imploring the judge to give me a life sentence. I do not recall her name so I will call her Sister Dunn.

Sister Dunn considers me a monster, a heartless killer, and had no compassion for either me or my family. It mattered not that I had no record, volunteered for five charities, was a successful filmmaker, or that I would never intentionally hurt anybody. I had expressed profound remorse, taken responsibility, and made restitution; all the things people don’t expect us to do but things I did because they came naturally to me as the right things to do. But for this I was accused of trying to “buy my way out of prison.” Sister Dunn told the judge the only thing that got her through her days was her church and the prayers of her pastor and all the good people of the congregation. Honestly, this confession blew me away. I certainly realized she was in a great deal of pain, but she wasn’t suffering alone.

With all due respect, I ask how we can stand on the bedrock of the church and claim Christ as the Cornerstone of our lives and simultaneously crack the whip that splits the skin of our transgressors? So we revere the adage “practice what you preach?”

I know personally from experience that losing a loved one is not easy and instinctively we want somebody to pay for the pain we feel when we hurt, especially in what seems a senseless death. But what Sister Dunn did not understand is that I, along with my family and friends, were grieving her brother, and praying for her, too. I was crushed by the tragedy, and I’ve never recovered. We are human and we make mistakes, albeit some greater than others with devastating consequences, but to forgive is to open God’s grace as the antidote to what ails us.

The Garden of Eden may have been tainted by sin, but we still grow, humankind, side by side in this world, like flora. There are keys to our survival such as kindness, like the warmth of the glorious sun and the ability to withstand the strong winds of change and trial. Sometimes deluged in rain or soaked in sadness, our spirits plunge or are invaded by pests we feel may devour our soul, but these elements test us and strengthen us like a new bud, so that ultimately, we can rise above and blossom unique and beautiful. Whether delicate or thorny we are worthy of redemption, mercy, and grace.

It’s been years now and still I hope that one evening at mail call a letter may arrive from Sister Dunn saying that she has forgiven me. I know that forgiveness is for her heart to heal, not my own. In forgiving, love can enter and heal even the deepest wounds.

I love this quote by Mark Twain: “Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it.” By practicing forgiveness, perhaps like a bee with the flowers nectar, we can spread the sweet perfume of love and compassion. It is a profound gift we can encourage and circulate.
