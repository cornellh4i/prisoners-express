**I’m Running for my Freedom by Celeste Minardi**

I had a very remarkable past life. I grew up in suburban Long Island, New York during the 1950’s. We had a strong community spirit. There were kids galore and two parent families. We celebrated the holidays in great fashion.

For Halloween, all the kids went trick-or-treating. We didn’t stop until the bags were full. We felt so rich when we got a quarter! LOL! Everyone decorated their homes for the holidays, especially Christmas with festive lights. I love Christmas time and used to put up three trees every year. There were two white ones and a lavender one.

I have collected hand blown ornaments since 1973, when my first son was born. I had bins and bins of decorations. There was a collection of snow village houses which lit up. My home was a Winter Wonderland! The neighbors would come over just to see my trees and decorations and of course for some eggnog.

Growing up on Long Island was a lot of fun. We lived on the water and had a boat. I learned how to fish, crab, and clam at an early age. I also swam like a fish! We would take our boat to Fire Island and have a barbeque with our neighbors. We always had clambakes. Thank God I love seafood. I love mussels, shrimp, oysters, clams, calamari, and all fish. We had the best summers, we had the sound and the Atlantic Ocean surrounding us. I also got to party in the Hamptons as a teenager.

I left Long Island for college in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was 1970, and I fell in love with Florida. It was so laid back compared to Long Island. Everything in New York is fast. Especially driving! We don’t fool around. I was very popular in high school. I dated but never kissed a boy. I got pregnant at twenty and had a son at twenty-one. I was not married but kept my child. He will be forty-seven this December and I will be sixty-eight.

I loved being a mom and took great pride in it. My children always came first. Mark lives in Colorado and his brother Brad is an investment banker on Wall St. Both my sons were popular in high school. Mark was the school’s quarterback and boy, could he play! Colleges were scouting him during senior year when he tore his ACL in his knee. It destroyed his prospects. Brad is nineteen years younger and was a scholastic genius, especially in math. He excels in his career. There are no grandchildren yet. I’m depending on Brad. He is so handsome and will make beautiful babies, but I don’t even know if he is married. It breaks my heart that I lost all contact with my family.

After raising my first son alone, I met my future husband, who was nineteen to my twenty-eight. He was so handsome. I put him through college and law school. We stayed together twenty-four years. We had an exceptional life living in a two million dollar home in Pasadena Yacht and Country Club. We had a three story home with an elevator, gourmet kitchen, library, pebble tech pool, jacuzzi, and a dock for the boat.

Our neighbors were professional ball players from the Buccaneers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Yankees, and Red Sox. My husband was in his glory! Our home was built to spec. There were hardwood floors inlaid with Italian marble and granite throughout. There was a floor to ceiling fireplace. This house had all the bells and whistles! It could have been in Architectural Digest. Yes, it was that magnificent.

I went through a terrible divorce in that house and I had to sell it. Then, my husband kidnapped my eleven year old son. I had a nervous breakdown. The doctor put me on Adderall to kick start me, but it backfired. I got down to eighty-seven pounds. I went into an amphetamine induced psychosis and committed my crime. Thank God my victim is alive.

I have a natural life sentence, which isn’t fair. Now, my attorney ex-husband got the judge to give me life, so he doesn’t have to pay me $4,900 a month in lifetime alimony. He had it stopped when I came to prison. Now I am indigent and it is very hard on me not having money to live on in prison. Prison has been hard on me physically and emotionally. It’s a very hard life.

Looking back, I never should have divorced my attorney husband. My life spiralled out of control. He was cruel to hide my son for fifteen months. I should never have taken the Adderall. I miss my sons so much. I will be sixty-eight December 1st. I don’t want to die in prison. I ruined my life. I will never take anything for granted. I do my clemency this year. My dream is to run for the gates of freedom.
