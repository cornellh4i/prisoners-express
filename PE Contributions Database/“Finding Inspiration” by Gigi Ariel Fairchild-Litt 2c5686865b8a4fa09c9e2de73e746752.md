**“Finding Inspiration” by Gigi Ariel Fairchild-Littlefield**

Finding inspiration in the way time crawls… finding inspiration in the writing on the walls… finding inspiration in drowning out the sounds of voices never ceasing, saying nothing of consequence…. Finding inspiration in the paper snowflakes hanging from the ceiling… in the here and now… in the consequences of time… in water wearing away stone… in knowing I’m not alone… in wishing I was home… in circumstances changing… laws rearranging… holding on for everyone… our time will come… hold on… I was a sculptress, a model, an artist, and much more… perhaps I am… still… I love you even though you are a criminal… Thanks for keeping your cell clean… and writing things for me to read… and not giving up even though the system’s corrupt… and smiling.
