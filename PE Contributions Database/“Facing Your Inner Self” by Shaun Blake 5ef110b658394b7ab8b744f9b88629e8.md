**“Facing Your Inner Self” by Shaun Blake**

I always try avoiding the cues that I don’t like, and facing fears is such a cue. As I procrastinated, I ended up admitting that what I was doing is avoiding “facing my fear” of doing a crappy job and of writing about my emotions. This reminded me of when I was in a therapeutic community drug program 11-13 years ago. The therapist required us to write a journal entry every day, and we were to include any significant episodes, thoughts, feelings, and observations from throughout the day. I sucked so bad at this assignment that I was assigned an extra journal and one-on-one counseling just to make sure I did my entries and also to help me learn to analyze them.

I still suck at facing my inner demons, but I try each day to overcome this aversion. Prisoner Express is helping me.

Once in a group meeting, while still in the aforementioned program, I became angry and made a big ruckus about a buy that had just been kicked out of the program (I’ll call him Ray). I said we were abandoning him and that he deserved another chance. The discussion deteriorated to yelling between our therapist and myself as the rest of the group sat back and gaped at us since the therapist and I usually got along great. She kept asking me, “What is your issue with Ray’s release from the program that has you so upset?” I immediately tried to deflect her question back to Ray’s situation and said something to the effect of, “We’re not talking about me. We’re talking about Ray and you staff’s throwing him out.” I was so angry that I walked out of the group, telling her to stick her f-ing program where the sun don’t shine (that’s the short, edited version).

When I tried to leave the program building and go back to my unit, the guard said I had to wait until the therapist had a private talk with me. If I caused him any problems, I’d get written up and sent to the hole. I stayed, fuming in the office where the guard kept an eye on me. When the therapist called me into her office, I went in but didn’t sit down and wouldn’t look at her. She’s really good at her job, and with her logical words breaking down the walls I had built, I finally sat down, cooled down, and listened up.

I told her I was still leaving the program and there was nothing she could say to stop me. (I’m stupid stubborn.) She said she wouldn’t put in any objections on one condition: I had to wait until the next day and to write one last entry in my journal about what I was feeling and why Ray’s leaving bothered me so much. I reluctantly agreed, thinking 24 hours wouldn’t make a difference--or would writing in that stupid journal.

When I sat down that night to write about the day’s events, nothing could come to me except mundane, superficial bullshit. So I tried, for my first time, the technique of free-writing. I sat back, closed my eyes, and took several deep breaths as I focused on my emotional state and thoughts. After a while, I sat back up and started writing whatever came to me. The first couple of sentences was gibberish, but I got no more than another paragraph when I realized how effective free-writing was. I felt so foolish about how I acted, and I was hit with the realization that what I was doing was trying to hide from myself that I was afraid that if Ray got kicked out, that I would, not could but would, be kicked out as well. I would be abandoned again. Boy, was this a hard thing to accept, but as I wrote, my psych opened up to reveal one of my greatest fears: being abandoned.

The next day, I met with my therapist and apologized for my behavior, thanked her for forcing me to wait and for suffering my tantrum, and decided to stay in the program. When she read my journal entry, she was pleased and let me know how well I’d done. Then she told me that Ray hadn’t been kicked out of the program; he requested to be removed because he wasn’t going to comply with some of the program requirements.

That was a mean trick she played! Haha, not really. The lesson I learned is to always face my fears and figure out what the core issues are and deal with them instead of hiding from them. By hiding from my fears, I hide from living life and learn nothing. Eventually, I would destroy who I am and who I can become. When this happens, it takes years to either rebuild what’s been destroyed, if that’s even possible, or build a better me. I never forget it is possible to accomplish building a better me and never give up on myself. I slide back sometimes, but I never quit.
