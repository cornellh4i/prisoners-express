**“Blink of An Eye”**, by Juicy Queen Bee

Hi, my nickname is Juicy Queen Bee. I’m a 31 year-old MTF and as I think about this theme, it got me thinking about life in prison and out of prison. These last few months have been crazy at SCT Somerset- an inmate was killed, a sergeant was killed, but to the Doc, the only one that mattered was the Sergeant so the Department of Corrections AKA the Department of Corruption (as I call them) started enforcing new changes and so on, like changing recreation. Now, exercising works on the same system as signing up for phones, or showers: kiosk on first shift Monday through Friday. Also, if your name is called Monday through Friday on the first shift, you only get to choose recreation in the yard or be locked in on the second shift, meaning you can go to night yard or dayroom only on the weekend and the Holidays. We are no longer allowed yard and dayroom together.

That got me saying anything can happen in a blink of an eye: one minute, it seems like everything is good and then it goes bad. One minute you’re on top, the next, you’re at rock bottom because you chose to make the wrong choices and depend on the wrong people. See, friends and family will say they’re going to be there for you but in the blink of an eye, they turn their back on you ‘cause they were using you, playing you like a fool, seeing what they could get. In the blink of an eye, you can only trust God, your mother and yourself to be there for you ‘cause a mother alway has her child’s back no matter what. In the blink of an eye, count on God to never fail you or leave your side, no matter what you did or who you are.
