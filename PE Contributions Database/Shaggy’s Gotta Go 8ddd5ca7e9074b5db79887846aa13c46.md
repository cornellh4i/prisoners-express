Shaggy’s Gotta Go by Pompa
Hair grows like scarecrows with a shaggy looking beard. “My hair is getting so long now,” says my reflection in the mirror. “Who is this?” I contemplate while looking in my eyes. Man, I need a haircut so I can shake off this disguise. I signed up, and they called to me, “You’re next up on the tier.” I walk down to the barber who says, “Now, what do we have here?” I told him, “I’ve got a mop and a shaggy beard growing out like a thicket, but if you can fade me up alright, I’ll shoot you a soda ticket.” It didn’t seem that long before he was done. “Alright, there you go now, son.” I thanked him and told him that I’ll see him again in a couple months.
