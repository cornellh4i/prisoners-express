**“Prized Possession” by Edward Jernigan Jr.**

As it has long been said, there are only two things in life that are certain. Death and taxes. Of course, as far as taxes are concerned, loopholes exist; however you’ll not find such ways to evade death. Death truly is certain. The dilemma present is how a man is supposed to convey such a truth to the premature mind of a little girl who has yet to reach adolescence much less any previous experience with this inevitable happening. The thought had been eating at Ray all day long.

Ever since Pamela’s family and friends started arriving long faces had become the day’s new standard. Tears soaked cheeks and smeared eyeliner in every room of the house. The house in which Ray and Pamela shared many moments together over the past three decades. A very small fraction of those moments contained the pathos of the one at hand.

Ray, feeling a pain that had clawed its way into the depth of the soul that none of his fellow mourners could possibly mimic at present, found it difficult to return the pity fueled by their temporary depression. All except one. Makayla, a young girl who had isolated herself from the various factions in the room. Her lower back was pressed firmly against the wall, arms wrapped around her shins, face buried in the crevice between her knees. None of the movement around provoked a response. Ray knew that her temporary depression would have a lasting effect on her journey through life some way or another. An intense sense of entitlement washed over Ray. He would have to do everything he could to ease her pain and influence the effects of this occurrence as positively as possible.

Out of nervous habit Ray lifted his ball cap off his head, scratched at his scalp, and ran his hand through the thin strands of gray hair before placing it back on his head. With the release of a heavy breath he approached the little girl.

“Hey there my little angel! How’s my grandest daughter?”

The somber visage that rose to meet his eyes was heartbreaking.

“Hey papa…” she replied, wiping a well of tears out of her eyes with the back of her hand.

Ray reached down and offered a hand to her, simultaneously tossing his head to the side in suggestion. Makayla eagerly accepted. Hand in hand Ray led her down a narrow hallway that was decorated with pictures of family dating back several generations to a wooden door that creaked loudly on its hinges as it opened toward a flight of stairs.

The two of them descended into a brief moment of darkness that was dimly extricated when Ray reached above his head and gave a tug at an aluminium beaded rope that hung from a light fixture. The room was packed full of boxes. Ray went directly to a small box, scooped It up, and continued through the room to another door.

This door gave way to warm rays that penetrated the dimly lit basement and caused Makayla to shield her eyes with her forearm. Ray and Makayla stepped out into the backyard. Ray knelt down on one knee and opened the box, as Makayla took a wooden flute decorated in leather strips and nature beads. With both hands Makayla cradled the flute as if the mahogany used to craft the instrument was actually glass.

After a few seconds of silence she looked up from the flute bewildered and asked, “What Is it papa?”

“Your grandmother’s most prized possession. It’s a flute. Whenever life got to be too much and she was feeling hurt or lost she’d pull this out and play it. According to her it would summon the spirits of her ancestors who would provide her with healing or guidance.”

“Spirits? You mean like ghosts?”

“I guess you could say that.”

“I don’t like ghosts papa, they scare me.”

“Oh angel, these ain’t no evil spirits. They’re made of the same stuff as you. They’re the ones who lived before us. They’re the ones that made you who you are today.”

“Yeah? Still sounds kinda scary though. Ain’t they dead?”

“I know that this doesn't make much sense to you right now but a day will come that you’ll be able to understand. Just always keep in mind that it ain’t the dead you should worry over. It ain’t them you should fear my child, but the living.”
