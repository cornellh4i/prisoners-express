**Republic Number Four The Cave 2.0 by Thomas Davis**

As Alexander looked out into the crisp azure sky, he had an epiphany. The rapidity of the energy coursing through his veins must have been what Plato experienced when he penned *The Republic Number Four - The Cave*. Stepping into his own light and away from the fetters and shadows of his past was philosophical in a sense. Alexander was now in Sikkim, India. The Land of Philosophy: Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Sikhism were all rooted here and flourished.

Sikkim, a former country of Southeast Asia was located on the southern slope of the Great Himalayas between Bhutan and Nepal. Since 1975, Sikkim had become a state of India. 1975 was the same year Alexander was conceived in Sikkim to some American hippies. Alexander was in his 51st year and a retired professor of cultural anthropology and economics. At six feet one and one hundred and eighty-four pounds, he could easily pass for an athletic thirty something yoga instructor. He had no visible gray hairs and the most piercing brown eyes, donated from his Indian bloodline. A life of being physically active had chiseled his body into a sinewy leather strap. He blew into his cupped hands to warm them and center the anxiety he felt for today’s trick.

It had been seven arduous years since he left the United States. Retracing his genetic lineage through West Africa; beginning in Accra, Ghana, and then unto Timbuktu, Mali. His 23&Me map went further northwest to Dublin, Ireland and Glasgow,  Scotland. There in Glasgow he found an old “spice” map from the 15th century in a local cartography shop that would eventually lead him to the cave he was currently peering out from.

He enjoyed the company of the other free-spirited hitchhikers, backpackers, drifters, nature lovers, and journalists who cohabited the cave with him. Some of them were staying on for a few more days; others had already departed before daybreak. Alexander let out a long loud burp - thanks to the kung pao that warmed his belly.

He heard a sound and turned toward the aft of the cave. He touched his dagger. He stopped. The sound and footsteps were familiar to him. Rashmi, a thirty-five year old Punjabi journalist with honey-cinnamon colored skin and raven hair, hugged Alexander from behind. He relaxed. “Are you ready, Mav?” Rashmi stated while smiling warmly at him.

“Yes, I’ve checked all of our gear. We have another 600 miles before we meet Singh. Let’s set off.” He replied.

Alexander thought to himself, “here I will replant my roots. Here I’ll become a business maverick my ancestors wanted me to be.”

Rashmi Singh looked at him and read his thoughts and stated “yes, yes my love.”
