**Sisters by Kathryn Clement**

Sisters stay together through thick and thin. A sister can be different in the family yet as a child of Christ is a sister by blood and spirit. In Jesus’s Name, to have a sister is awesome when you go through a situation that treats you unjustly and she treats you with unconditional love.

To have a sister by your side when others turn you away or forsaken (emotionally abandoned) is a God blessing, Favor of God. Thank you Lord Jesus, I am so thankful for my sister to be in my life and glad God created her for my trials, situation in life, treat me as a human being, someone worth to invest in without judging, condemning, bettering me, encouraging me for the Lord Jesus and we are His vessel will get to ‘move forward’ teaching others how to get out of abusive lives and be God’s. In Jesus’s Name.

To God Be The Glory,
