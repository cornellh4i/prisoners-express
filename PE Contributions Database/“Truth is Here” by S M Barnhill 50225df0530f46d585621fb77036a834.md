**“Truth is Here” by S.M. Barnhill**

Do those jeans really make you look fat? Were you honestly NOT looking at the passing girl? Did car problems really cause Junior to miss curfew? Do these, or infinite similar questions plague your home? Or maybe: Does my boss really value me as an employee? Is she really going to give me a bonus? Are they actually going to come back tomorrow to buy the car?

Life is full of questions. Questions we cannot possibly know the answers to. Until Now!

Introducing TRUTH (The Realities Under Their Head), this app easily installed on your electronic device gets to the heart of the matters that add to your relationship, home, and work stress.

Using technology designed by NASA to communicate in the event of Extraterrestrial encounters, TRUTH collects all the conversation -- not just the words spoken, but also words thought!

It’s easy to use too! Just own it and TRUTH does rest. Then, later, to find out TRUTH, just open the app, use the simple date and time selector, and TRUTH will pull up an easy to read color coded dialogue. Don’t know the date and time? No Problem! Search by name, location, or keyword. You can also pull TRUTH on any other device or computer buy logging in with your phone number, email address, or social media screen name. TRUTH automatically knows your login information!

It’s time to stop letting those unanswered questions destroy your life. Get TRUTH and stop wondering.
