****I have had many first jobs. My first job on the streets came when I was 15 years old, and my parents had gotten divorced. I was living with my single mother and little sister who at the time was just 12 years old.

My first job was at a little mom-and-pop restaurant in New Carlisle, Ohio called the Mel-O-Dee. I was a part time dishwasher.

Then came my first job when I joined the United States Army, learning to become a U.S. soldier, which by the way did not come easy. There were very long, excruciating and painful runs of 3, 4, 5 miles at a time.

Next came my first job after my unit was deployed to Iraq in 2008. My military job was a food service specialist. In layman's terms, I was a cook. While on deployment, I never did much cooking at all. There were civilian contractors to do all the cooking. Most of the time, I just sat at the entrance to the chow hall with this little clicker, keeping count of all the soldiers who came to eat the meal.

There was my first job I worked after being injured in Iraq and receiving my Honorable discharge under medical conditions. I was a shift manager at McDonald’s. I worked there for a while until I realized, “Hey, I’m not making ends meet. I am falling behind on my bills…”

So that led to my first side job selling a little weed, which never hurt anybody, right? Wrong! That led to five people trying to rob me with a 2x4 with nails in it, which led me to killing a young man. And that’s how I received my 28 year prison sentence.

I came to a prison in 2011 on voluntary manslaughter, 4 felonious assaults, and 2 trafficking of marijuana, and upon arrival, I had my first job: prove myself as a strong man who wasn’t going to become a victim inside the belly of the beast. When it all started, two black guys showed up at my cell and said, “Hey white boy! What ya in for?” I stood up without hesitation, and I punched the biggest of the blacks. As he went down, I moved to his buddie. We fought for a little while before my cellie let us know that the C.O.s were coming. I yelled at them as they were leaving, “I ain’t no white *boy*. I’m a white *man*!”

That mentality has been my first job inside the joint, but as I got older and been inside for a few years now, I realized that my most important job is staying healthy and safe, and making it to my out date. I grew to realize that my first job should be focusing on reaching my freedom, instead of what others want you to be doing like fighting and bickering. Our first job is about our freedom: understanding your rights, since guards will try to get to you every chance they can. They hate when a prisoner knows the policies and educates other prisoners. Take the time to learn the proper way to keep yourself protected. Know how to access what you need, when you need it, and always stay focused on your freedom!
