**A Life of Nourishment by Jordan Berg**

When you think of nourishment, the most common thought is food. Those folks wouldn’t be wrong at all. We need food to survive along with physical nourishment, mental nourishment, emotional nourishment.

I don’t want to talk about most of these nourishments. It's impossible for anyone to survive without physical and emotional nourishment. It's the mental nourishment I want to discuss.

Prison brings about plenty of idle time. As of this writing, the COVID-19 virus has our Wisconsin Facility on a perpetual lockdown. Everything is delivered to our doors segregation style.

24/7 lockdown for an indefinite time gives anyone willing to better themselves the opportunity to learn. Ie: mental nourishment.

I first picked up reading on a regular basis after being placed in RHU. As most are aware, being in RHU leaves you with literally nothing. A concrete bed, toilet, sink and in some cases, a in cell shower.

At my institution, books are brought around weekly, letting you check out up to 4 books of a list 12+ pages long (side note- if it wasn’t for G. Francis who donates his entire state check to buying new books for RHU, mainly educational, it would be limited).

These books have helped me tremendously. Growing up I literally thought I knew everything. My mom made that statement all the time.

Turns out I don’t.  But I grew to like to read books that challenge my way of thinking. I’m a very vocal Republican, but that doesn’t stop me from pursuing Democratic points of view. I don’t agree with everything that's said, but the point is to be enlightened.

I’ve learned to read all subjects. One topic that really challenged me were books on ethics. If it wasn’t for the glossary, I would’ve been lost.

A couple years ago I was launched into the subject of Civil Law. Boy oh boy is that subject endless. Research is tedious, but most people hate it. Expect me, I do enjoy it.

This was a pinnacle moment in my prison journey. It started by helping me navigate a civil mess. But during this mess it opened my mind to something I enjoy. Before my release in October 2022 my hope is to become a certified Paralegal.

Those small steps starting with reading books led to a moment on mental nourishment that continues each day. It took baby steps, but the nourishment I received came from books rather than the people around me.

I understand that it may be difficult for some people to sit down and hold a book. But start small. It literally might change your life as it did mine.
