**“Recollections of Springtime from my Childhood”**

**by Michael Oakleaf**

I grew up in the Shenandoah River valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains in northern Virginia. Most years, I was blessed to experience all four seasons and the entirety that each had to offer. My favorite season was winter. I loved the serene beauty of a snowy day, but even as a child, I knew that one could definitely have too much of a good thing. Frequently, I found myself longing and ready for spring when it finally arrived.

Linguists believe the Modern English word “Spring” evolved from the ancient “sprengh” which meant “rapid movement.” I cannot think of a better word to describe the season. Often, it began after a final but feeble attempt by winter to persevere. Spring, with her increasingly longer days, warming temperatures and occasional rain showers melted away the remaining snow and ice, especially at the highest elevations or hiding in the darkest shadows. Once-frozen ponds liquified and filled as mountain streams and creeks swelled and coursed more rapidly, feeding the ever-meandering Shenandoah. Seemingly overnight, the natural world came to life.

The nearly monochromatic landscape with somber shades of grey and brown transformed into one filled with all combinations of red, blue and yellow with hues of green interwoven throughout. Everywhere, new flora poked out of the ground. Perennial trees and shrubs sprouted new foliage: leaves that absorbed winter’s cache of carbon dioxide and water, producing life-sustaining energy and oxygen. Leaves that provided essential nutrients to all types of organisms in our planet’s food web. Leaves that offered shade on the hottest summer days yet to come. Many plants, like the dogwood and redbud trees, or the aromatic honeysuckle bush, began the process of reproduction with attractive flowers in vibrant creams, yellows and pinks. Not to be outdone were the blooms in my Mother’s flower beds: yellow daffodils, orange gladiolus, tulips and holly hocks in an array of colors that filled the air with bold and alluring aromas. For some vegetation, flowers were just the opening act for the sweet fruits and berries to follow.

With the flora, came the fauna. Critters of all shapes and sizes crawled forth from their winter burrows, some with young in tow and others in search of a mate. Birds-of-a-feather flock back from warmer, more southern climates to build their nests. Each spring, I sought to see my first robin with its reddish breast, heralding the official return of spring. Much of the season’s rapid movement was the result of insects: buzzing bees dancing from flower to flower, spiders spinning webs in search of a meal that glistened in the sun on dew-dampened mornings; and alien-looking caterpillars eating their way through their first incarnation of life, preparing to cocoon and fly into their next. Everywhere I looked, I found life in motion: rabbits, squirrels, and skunks, tadpoles, waterbugs, fish and lizards. Once while digging in the dirt, I unearthed a nest with dozens of baby rattlesnakes. Immediately, they raised their heads and upper bodies out of the dirt. They angrily swayed back and forth in defense of their home and in protest of my accidental intrusion.

Finally, spring was a time for people. Gardens were dug and planted. Lawn furniture, outside toys and yard decorations were pulled from their winter storage, cleaned, and put on display. I enjoyed little more than running barefoot on a lush green carpet of thick grass, or lazing on a warm rock, listening to the creek babel after a cold, quiet winter. Happiness for me was seeing flocks of sheep with their new spring lambs frolicking in pastures. I felt alive breathing in the fresh air, taking in a kaleidoscope of colors, the explosion of movement, the symphony of sound, the bouquet of fragrances that we call spring.
