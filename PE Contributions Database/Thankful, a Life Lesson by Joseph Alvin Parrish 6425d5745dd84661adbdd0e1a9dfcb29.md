**“Thankful, a Life Lesson” by Joseph Alvin Parrish**

Yeah it’s me again, thankful ole Joe.

When you encounter the word, “Thankful,” what comes first to your mind? I know one word that would enter the picture. Thankful: being appreciative for something or other. Does that describe you or are you the kind that goes around grumbling and complaining, looking for every little slight or fault? Whichever one you do, give thanks or grumble and complain. Watch out, be careful, it can become a habit and before you know it, it becomes a raging inferno. And so I will get back to me, before I allow myself to get off track. I find myself always trying to give advice instead of keeping the focus on myself. I guess that you can say that I care for you. I don’t want to see anyone paying negative consequences for their stupid behavior. My advice is found in the Holy Bible, 1 Thess 5:18: “In all things give thanks, for this is the will of God in christ Jesus concerning you.” My faith is deeply rooted in Christianity and so you should see why I am conversing with you on a spiritual standpoint. I would go so far as to say that being thankful is a virtue. “Thankfulness” should characterize the Christian life in every circumstance, not thanks for everything, but thanks in everything. Paul emphatically states, “This is the will of God (1 Thess. 5:18).” An old testament example of this was when Job lost his money, his children, and his health. He blessed the name of God in spite of his personal tragedies, not because of them. Nothing speaks more powerfully of a walk with God than continuous thankfulness.
