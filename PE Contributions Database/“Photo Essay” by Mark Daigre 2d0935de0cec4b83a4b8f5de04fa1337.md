**“Photo Essay” by Mark Daigre**

I never thought that this picture actually existed. My brother and I still chained together, exhausted from the six hours we had just spent running away from the people who had made us do all that stuff for the last three years.

This was only the second time we had been allowed to wear shoes outside. We’d made plans to escape, but never went through with them, mostly because I was so afraid of what they would do to us if we got caught. I can still remember the first and only time we tried; I still have a scar on my chest from that lashing. My brother’s back will never look right.

I don’t know why we were chained together, maybe because it amused someone to see the two of us, so alike to be going different directions all the time. Often one of us would be called and at the same time, the other would be called in a different direction, so we had to pull against each other, giving it all we had, any sign that one of us was giving the other a break, the other would be beaten and the “nice” one of us would be forced to watch and (sometimes) participate in the beating.

My brother was the stronger of the two of us, he always made me give in so that he could be the one getting the beating. He could be the one with the bruises and cuts. He’s the first one of us to lose a tooth, and the only one of us to suffer from a broken bone. Before this picture was taken, he literally carried me for over a mile, getting us to safety in the circus.

Today, we are “Wolf Children”. We have kept our faces hidden for so long, we didn’t know that we could walk around without them covered. The only time I didn’t breathe stale air was in my bed. Today, I proudly show my hair covered face and fur covered body.

Today we are twelve. Today is the day that we are going to escape again. Today I hope that we are finally going to live without chains. Today is the day that we will either live free or die trying…
