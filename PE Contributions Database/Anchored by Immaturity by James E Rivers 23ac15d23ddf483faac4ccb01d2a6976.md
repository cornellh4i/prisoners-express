**“Anchored by Immaturity” by James E. Rivers**

Part A:

A child is born! Most parents set goals. That is, goals to help their children conquer the challenging demands of life! Hopefully taught at educational, vocational, spiritual institutions. I thought I had achieved those goals! I had played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. Played in the marching and concert band, maintained a “B” average, plus displayed exceptional mannerisms/was liked by everyone though college graduation, (1943). So what went wrong?

I just loved teaching my 5th graders. That only lasted for 3 years. I got busted for a misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and received 1 year of probation and a $1,000 fine!

“If you ever come in front of me again for anything,” spoke Judge Wallace Max, “I will give you the maximum sentence. Do you understand me?”

“Yes, sir!”—Trembling. (June, 1976).

I wanted no part of him! I had resigned from teaching but still had my evening job of working with the 4-H Kids of America.

My wife, age 22, and I, age 25, had been married for one year and 10 months and only had one child, James, Jr., age 1. I enjoyed playing with him every night. He was like a “savior” to me. Born to rid me of my secretly kept childhood pains of never knowing my biological father. I was adopted and raised by grandparents, and mom lived in New Jersey.

“It only takes a spark to get a fire going!”

My marriage at first had a few problems due to my infidelity, but had begun to bloom into a beautiful flower. I was madly in love with her!

It was on the Friday morning of July 2, 1976. Rhonda drove away for her nurse’s technician job at Lee Memorial Hospital. I was off from work that day so I would take the babysitter. I took James Jr. out of his playpen. Balanced his feet on the carpet, and then began teaching him how to dribble a basketball.

“That’s pretty good, young dude. I can see right now that I’ll put you into a whoop’s camp one day to help you dribble your way into the NBA!”

I placed him back into his playpen, grabbed my toolbox, and went outside to do some minor work on my 1967 Dodge Sportsman v6 van. About 15 minutes later I spotted him about to push his way through the door of our front porch! I ran and caught him before he could tumble onto the 2 feet high concrete steps!

“So, you’ve tumbled on your head out of your playpen looking for that ball?”

I returned back inside.

“Here! Take this ball. It now belongs to you. I’ll buy me another one!”

We both were asleep and worn out as the sound of Rhonda’s 1967 Plymouth Valiant pulled up. We arose from the carpet. As I kissed her, I handed him to her.

“Sweetheart, I’m headed to the park for a few games of hoops. I bought some okra for you to fry.”

“James, I don't have any grease to fry it in.”

“Just drive down a few blocks to your folks grocery store and get some on credit. We both get paid next week.”

“I’m tired of getting stuff on credit. It’s embarrassing “

I ignored her and pulled off. Upon my return I stopped Mrs. J Frankie’s van packed in front of my house. She was a school teacher and a friend of my wife’s.

“Hello, Ms. Frankie,” I said as I walked in. “You okay?”

“Yes, James.”

“James, I kind of messed up your food trying to fry it in water.”

By that time I had reached the kitchen and peeped up under the frying pan’s lid at the grotesque looking okra! I was pissed! The two women could sense it as I walked back past them not even saying one word. I made it to my van and pulled off! I made a right turn, then another one, one block over behind my house’s street. I was on my way to a bar four blocks away to bum a drink. But I spotted a blue parked Super Bee.

“Come in Doc Rivers,” as I rang the doorbell.

“Peanut, may I use your phone?”

“Of course, Doc.”

I dialed my house’s number. “You stupid bitch!” Hung up.

“Who in the world are you talking to like that?” asked Peanut.

“To my wife. She messed up my food!”

“Well, don’t talk to her like that! Here. Sit down and pour yourself a drink. The two of you will be okay.”

“Mam, how are you and Leon doing?”

“Not too good, but we’ll work it out.”

I left Peanut’s house in 3 minutes. Returned to my house. Rhonda and the kid weren’t there. I returned to the park, stayed for an hour, then returned home. Rhonda was there. I had never seen her as mad as she was. She wouldn’t talk.

I took her back over to her folks’ home. I figured she would cool off for a few days but instead she disappeared with James Jr.! “Over some food,” I thought. But then I found out why! Right when I had called her a came on Peanut’s phone, she left Ms. Frankie and saw my van parked in front of Peanut’s house. A rumor was now circulating around town that Peanut and I had rekindled our love affair. I had broken a relationship with her two years before marrying Rhonda and had never dated her again! That lie really affected me. I was in love with my wife and son.

On July 10, 1976, I pulled a prank as if I had swallowed some rat and roach poison. Ii was very fearful of my son’s safety and had to do something to bring her out of hiding! I spread the stuff on my face, laid down on my front enclosed yard’s sidewalk, then spilled the can beside me. A passerby soon spotted me and called for an ambulance. As they loaded me into it I kept my eyes closed, but could feel the presence of a crowd on the scene.

My plan was to inform the medical staff of the hoax upon reaching the emergency room. But because I was half drunk, I fell asleep and woke up in the psychiatric ward!

“I didn’t find any poison in your stomach,” said Dr. Waun as he pulled a tube back out of my nose. “I only found alcohol.”

“That’s all you were supposed to find. I would never try to commit suicide. It was just a hoax to bring my wife out of hiding for fear of my son’s safety. I’m leaving.”

“You can’t leave, Mr. Rivers. I’m required by law to observe you for three days.”

I sat quietly for three days and read novels. My wife came to the hospital upon my release, but didn’t have James Jr. with her. She then walked into a psychiatrist's office. As I walked 5 minutes later, she walked out.

“Man, what did you say to my wife?” I asked as he stood behind his desk.

“I just told her to live her life as she saw fit.”

I was shocked and thought about slapping the shit out of him!

I had begged the pastor who married me and Rhonda to set up a meeting with us and her folks to help me save my marriage. He shopped at their grocery store, plus they were members of his church and were friends.

“I’m sorry, James. I can’t do that. Your in-laws might then think that I’m on your side.”

A week later I went to my in-law’s small neighborhood grocery store. Rhonda was in the middle aisle stocking a shelf.

“Rhonda. What’s the meaning of this paperwork I received. You know that I don’t want a divorce!”

“You’ve got plenty of money!” My father-in-law was standing ten feet behind me. “Contest it!”

“Rhonda, please let me see my son. Not being able to see him is affecting me.”

She was about to say okay but my father-in-law interrupted.

“No! You can’t see him!”

As more pain began to engulf my body I almost cried. I slowly walked away. My mother-in-law was standing behind the counter as I passed her. She had a look of disapproval on her face concerning the way I was being treated. But she remained silent. I wouldn’t expect any wife to buck against her husband. Little did anyone know that she and I had talked secretly on the phone, with her giving me good advice as to how to get my wife back. I did go to another pastor for help, but he too turned me down.

I went on a drunken spree. I wanted to get my little boy so bad, I took a gun to my in-law’s house one night to get him. I was drunk but it seemed like something else was going on! I woke up in a local hospital. My head was spinning from some type of hangover as I heard a mixture of tangled echoing voices from within. As I focused my eyes I discovered that I was handcuffed to a bed. Two policemen stood by. They informed me that I had shot and killed my mother-in-law. I thought they were trying to play a joke on me. That is, until they brought me a 3 day old newspaper. Everything pointed towards me. There were two pages of pictures from the scene with the sheriff. I was through, for my father-in-law (black) knew all of the big wheels in town! The case was assigned to Judge Wallace Max!

“James, did you hate or ever wanted to harm your mother-in-law?”

“No!” I answered to the defense attorney my grandmother had hired. “I always liked her.”

“Well, your wife said that you had written her letters to kill her mom.”

“She’s telling a lie, sir!”

“I sent my investigator around to the house but your wife told him she had misplaced them.”

My attorney left the hospital. The lone cop walked me to a medical conference room. As I sat I saw three doctors sitting around the table.

“Had you been drinking, James?”

No way I would answer him. He was the psychiatrist who had told my wife to live her life as best as she saw fit! All of my muscles seemed to freeze up! I couldn’t move; the cop had to drag me back down to the bed.

One day later I was transferred to the county jail and the next day I was back at the hospital. This time because of fear of what would become of me! A nurse who was my wife’s best friend kept picking on me so I asked to be returned to the jail!

Another month passed by. A bailiff approached my cell.

“James, Judge J. Adamsay would like for you to attend his civil court this morning.”

“Tell Judge Adamsay that I said the kiss my (refraining). I’m not attending!”

He left without me. At the final dissolution of marriage hearing, Rhonda’s divorce was granted with sole custody of James Jr!
