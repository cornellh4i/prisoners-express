**Sisters by Manuel Aleman**

Grace is seven years older than me and she was nothing like the other girls in our family. Most of them (okay, all of them) were sexually active at a very young age. I know this because the ones that were my age practiced kissing on me. Meanwhile, my older brother banged the rest of them, or so he claimed.

By the time our female cousins were becoming teenaged moms, it was rumored that Grace was still a virgin. Were there any lesbian rumors floating around? You bet. Our mom was the one that was putting it out there.

It didn’t help that Grace was hanging around the gay community before it was a thing. 30 years before Taylor Swift made the “You need to calm down” video, Grace had all kinds of colorful characters lounging inside the apartment. Her best friend was a lesbian chick, with boyish features and all her homeboys were a bit feminine.

On top of that, Grace was a little on the heavy side and didn’t let mom’s pleas to slim down stop her from consuming pastries. It was like she put on the pounds in order to keep all the pimple popping, fast food eating, football watching, fake tough guy, horny teenage boys at bay. It worked, too. I can’t recall any dudes ever driving by and whistling at her or walking up and asking for her number. Our mom got more attention.

But all that changed before her senior year in High School. Grace had been saving up money from her after school job and bought a car and a new wardrobe; with a little bit of sex appeal. All of a sudden she was going out to football games and parties. All of a sudden she was eating less and exercising. Her motto was “more lettuce, less cake.” All of a sudden a handsome young man, in a nice car, was coming over and taking her out on dates. Nobody was happier than my mom to meet Grace’s boyfriend. Soon, Grace came home bragging to our older brother that she finally did “it.” And by “it” she meant losing her virginity.

Everything was going great until an armed robber walked into Grace’s job, put a gun to her face and said, “Empty out the register!” She did as she was told. When the robber left, Grace broke down like a Pinto on 3 hubcaps. When we got the phone call, we all hopped in the car to pick her up.

Grace was shaken up from her experience and needed to get away. Her gay BFF suggested a vacation. So, with my mom’s blessing and her manager’s permission she went to Mexico for some well-deserved R&R.

Sooner than expected, Grace returned (while no one was home to welcome her), and locked herself in her room. She didn’t want anyone to see her. When her boyfriend came by to check on her, she told him to GO AWAY. Something had happened to her in Mexico, we just didn’t know what.

After days of reasoning with her she agreed to talk to us one by one. Mom went in first before coming out crying, then my brother spoke to her. When it was my turn, I was warned to brace myself for what I was about to see. Grace’s beautiful face looked disfigured with huge purple and red rashes/bumps all over. Not to sound funny, but she looked like something out of a horror movie. She said her face hurt and you could hear the pain in her face when she spoke. Besides the physical pain, the depression was killing her even worse. In her diaries she wrote about suicide.

Mom contacted a witch to tell us what happened to Grace and she had a vision of a girl that Grace had been bullying at school. This Girl was so afraid of Grace that she refused to fight, but retaliated with a curse instead. Grace fessed up and said it was all true.

The witch then set out to reverse the curse while Grace saw a doctor. Luckily, after a few voodoo rituals, pills and ointments, Grace was back to normal and feeling better than ever’ with a few minor scars.

One day Grace and I went to confront her nemesis, but the girl locked herself in the house and threatened to call the cops. I wanted to leave but Grace wanted to kick some ass, “What’s up now, bitch!”

Nowadays Grace owns her own business and has been married for 20 years to a hardworking man. She doesn’t have any kids because she is afraid they will turn out like me. Whatever, I ain’t losing my sleep over it. Sadly, throughout my years in prison we’ve lost touch. Nowadays she acts like we were never related.
