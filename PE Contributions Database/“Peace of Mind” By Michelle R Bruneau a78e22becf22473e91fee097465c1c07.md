**“Peace of Mind” By Michelle R. Bruneau**

A place like this is good for peace and quiet. To think and get your mind right. A place to pray and meditate. You can get good, clean, fresh air, which is healthy. I would love to take time out of my busy life to go here and get a peace of mind. May God use a place like this to rain His blessings down on someone like you or me who takes the time to enjoy His creation and to get a peace of mind. A peace of mind is what we need at times.
