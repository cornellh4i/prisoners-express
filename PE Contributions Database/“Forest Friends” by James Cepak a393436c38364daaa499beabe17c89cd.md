**“Forest Friends” by James Cepak**

Floating notes flow as the wind blows. A melody from a flute or pay pipes covering leaves with dew. Forest songs draw me on like a feather to dance through wind and weather. I had heard of nymphs, dryads and pixies; all types of fairies and their dances seen. But hearing a take and meeting a sprite is truly a different experience of heart-flight.

The girl’s face was elven and innocent, her eyes closed as her flute floated feathers of a melody, oh so familiar to me, on the wings of the breeze. Yet I couldn’t define what it said to me. As a heart beat, it was a thing from a dream where teasing mists breath and animals speak.

SNAP!

A twig underfoot stopped the song like a shot silencing Deadwood. I stood shocked as if the deadman’s hand with its aces and eights laid, stopping my heart for a price paid.

“Did you feel its pain?” a soft voice chirped, sorrow shined as tarnished silver in the words, a beam glowed of lights flowed. The girl stared at me, her big sad eyes colored like the forest greens she seemed to feel pain that wouldn’t rest.

Amazed, I realized I did feel like slide from that simple twig that lay among tangled vines. I tore at my lip as tears hit. I tasted blood a bit, my teeth shredding my cheek. “I’m sorry...I didn’t...I mean, I feel and I didn’t mean to-”

“Man never means to,” the girl sighed, “but you always do. Kill, take, shatter and break...as long as it serves you, you don’t care that it hurts, these things you chose.”

Stunned, flummoxed; I truly felt like a great lummox. She spoke true and I didn’t know what to do. This sprite, so like a child, had the wisdom of the wild. I wanted to understand but I could not demand, thus I did plead: “Show me what to change and how to be.”

“Feel, help life grow,” she beamed; a child no more than nine, though I thought I’d had a young woman envisioned as a fairy in my mind. “Be true. Stand bold, teach others to talk and dance with trees. Then you’ll truly be free.”

I had to ask. “What’s your name?”

“Felicity, not that it will be of gain,” she replied, smiling as if a game was being played.

I couldn’t speak so I dropped to a knee; I wound my fingers around the leaves of a vine I could find crawling between the trees. I found the twig, its pieces parted, yet I felt life somehow restarted.

Felicity vanished from my sight, but still her song took flight in echoes as day became

night. “Dance among the trees and be free. Teach and show the world great dreams. I heard the words on the notes of the song even after the wind carried the sound of pixie pipes far, far off.
