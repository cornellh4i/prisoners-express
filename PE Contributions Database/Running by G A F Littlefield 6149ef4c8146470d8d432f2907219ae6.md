**Running by G.A.F. Littlefield**

Run. On the dark side of the moon. Running on empty with Jackson Browne. Running wild. Running free. I know what I’m running from, but not where I’m running to… maybe I’m running from myself… maybe I haven’t thought this through… Keep moving on.. Keep moving forward… Trying not to look back over my shoulder… In the long run… it’s a long run… a day in the sun… Don’t bother counting how many trips around one… I know we can take it… if our love is a strong one… Remember the Eagles and Time Slipping Into the Future or Holes by Louis Sachar? “If only, if only, the moon speaks no reply; reflecting the sun and all that’s gone by. Be strong my weary wolf, turn around boldly. Fly high my baby bird, my angel, my only.” Remember Robin Trower? An album suggestion: Coming Closer to the Day… and a quote from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, IV 4.5: “You are what your deep, driving desire is. As your desire is, so is your will. As your will is, so is your deed. As your deed is, so is your destiny.” Stop running. Stop counting every step… Fly and be free… and remember everyday’s a holiday, Big Boy… and if someone offers you COVID, just say NO. Stay safe, stay strong… It’s a long, long, long, long run...
