**Nylon, Day-Glo & Neon Memories by Chad Frank**

My memories

Are made of nylon, Day-Glo and neon

And fueled by Kool-Aid and sugary cereals

And a childhood spent in front of the television.

Hulkamania

Happy Meals and Big Wheels

GI Joe and He-Man

Garanimals and Fun Pals

“Rambo and Rocky”

Monster trucks and roller derbies

“E.T.”

“Purple Rain”

Michael Jackson

“The Gremlins”

Saturday Morning Cartoons

How I wish I could return

To those bright, carefree days

Instead of being trapped here

In this khaki and grey nightmare.
