Believe it or Not…

… I was 3 when my mother was shot to death

… I stole from my church when I was a kid

… I performed at the Mosque in Richmond, Virginia

… I destroyed a god

… I witnessed the birth of my son Hunter

… I helped kidnap a girl away from her pimps

… I still love my cheating ex-wife

… I don’t know if Hunter is mine

… I actually escaped prison once

… I’m only human.
