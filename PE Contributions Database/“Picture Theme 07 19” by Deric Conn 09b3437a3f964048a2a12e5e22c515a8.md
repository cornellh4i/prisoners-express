**“Picture Theme 07/19” by Deric Conn**

Today was rough without Samson, but we pushed on for the sake of the master. Until his death at a good old age, Samson had been the alpha of our pack. He constantly kept us motivated on runs. Even when the rest of us felt too exhausted to go on, Samson drove us to keep going. The master tried to retire Samson one time, but the old hound wasn’t having it. Whenever the master prepared the pack to pull, Samson was there to badger him. It took a few weeks for the master to give In, but he finally did and Samson was returned to his rightful place. We all admired Samson’s tenacity and leadership. He was like a father to us and will always be alpha in our hearts. Now I must carry the torch that Samson left, chosen by the master to lead. Me and three others-my brother Thomas, Jakk and Elsa-are the pack now. Elsa is our new pup, trained by the master to replace our lost comrade. It’s strange that the master picked a girl to pull, because I’ve never witnessed a female pulling before. Must have something to do with equal rights…

To my right, I hear Elsa whimper in her struggle to keep pace. A phrase Samson used often comes to mind and I shout it for her to hear: “When strength whispers, I can't; will shouts, I must.” I smile as Elsa picks up speed and I feel the load lighten to my left. Thomas nods his approval. Thomas and I were born only minutes apart, and, though we both get competitive at times, our bond is strong. Jakk is the clown of the pack. He knows how to make anyone laugh in a sore situation. Today, however,he Is focused on the run, trying to cope with the loss of Samson.

Though we each have our individual weaknesses, united alpha, I have to make sure we keep moving forward. I will follow Samson’s example… to live each day to its fullest, to strive to leave an impression, and to never give up no matter how hard the run.
