**“Dock in the Bay” by Carl Branson**

It was the late 1960’s or early 1970’s that Otis Redding hit the pop music charts with “Sitting on the Dock in the Bay.” The lyrics in this song tell of a long and weary journey filled with undefined travails ending with a sense of inner peace being achieved through the isolation of sitting alone on the dock in the bay watching the hustle and bustle of the world go by.

For me, this song is a metaphor for my journey in the criminal injustice system. Threading my way through the process of indictment, ridiculous plea offers, and jury trial was taxing both emotionally and physically. However, much like Otis Redding’s lyrical character, I have been able to obtain that sense of inner peace that comes from a full understanding of the circumstances leading to the isolation of sitting alone on the dock in the bay.

My “dock” is, and has been, whatever bunk that has been assigned to me. My sense of inner peace arises from news (TV and papers) exposés and court decisions condemning the hysteria, zealotry, and, yes, even corruption that pervades our legal system. Certainly, many of these reports inflame an initial response of irritation and frustration. However, my inherent cynical, sarcastic character in conjunction with my belief in the “what goes around comes around” mantra rapidly takes control.

Recent court decisions provide grounds for hope that I will be exonerated from what I have always viewed as an abusive prosecution. **BUT**-and that is a “but” in bold caps-regardless of whether I am able to derive benefit from recently confirmed legal principles, my sense of inner peace will not be disturbed. I will continue to placidly watch our society flounder under the burden of laws instigated and executed by the likes of Gladys Cravits (busy-body character in “Bewitched” sitcom).
