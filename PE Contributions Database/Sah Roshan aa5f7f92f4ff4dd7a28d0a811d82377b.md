My first job was as a dishwasher. I had never done dishes in the past. It was at the University Cafeteria. I had to make some money for the next semester and pay the bills so I was looking for any kind of job. I had never worked in my life or had a job.

I didn’t like the job. I used to get free food after my shift was over. I didn’t like the smell of American food because it doesn’t have any spices. I’m from India and you know I like the smell of curry. The pots were giant. After finishing my shift I used to go to my apartment. My roommate always made fun of me because I smelled like food.

Soon I found another job. Even though I didn’t like the dishwashing job but I appreciate the experience of having a job. It helped me in future to be more responsible.
