**“Save It” by Solomon Boyd**

I knew the voice of true love yet still I was deceived. Do I dare give credit to that false angel and its bright glorious light. Do I act as Satan and accuse like the accuser, or do I confess my sins and ask forgiveness.

Confess my sins, is that point. Is it necessary that the guilty admit guilt. I admit I’m not perfect, but I was in a true love relationship. I had a partner who I adored and accepted for who she was and she reciprocated. I can’t say that it wasn’t or was enough at that time, complacency can be a dagger.

Looking back now, why of course it’s enough, It’s not that love is so rare, it simply should be honored. Have you ever read Proverbs? If you haven’t, read it, and all of it.

You will notice that wisdom and the harlot present themselves quite similar. They stand at the same place, calling you at the same time, claiming the same way. The paths end very differently though.

My love and I were committed and resolutely happy with each other. But then another appeared like an angel and nothing less than. He was taller, rich and kinder, appearing to be, as if.

How do you walk away from true love when another love comes along? How can love compare against love? This is how a person becomes guilty yet pleads innocent of an affair. It may be love vs. true love.

I gave her hugs and kisses every day. I did everything a lover should do. Could I have done more? There can always be more.

Then came along more and Mr. More, well, was beautiful enough to garner anyone’s love. Anyone who gives more on top of love has to be an angel.

But there is no account where it is feasible for one to love an angel. Every time one encounters an angel, one falls down. One is awed so much one wants to worship and love this Holy. The true angel always says, “Get up, I’m not the one, I’m not what you’re looking for.” So I have mercy on the one who’s willing to contemplate bending knees before that fallen angel.

Because the false angel isn’t going to say, “Get up. Fooled ya.” Is there no pity that we’re short Jesus and likely to succumb to temptation.

So when she asked for forgiveness (somehow she realized he’s no angel), I told her I’m no angel. She could save her apologies. What good are they to me? It’s of no value and no one gives anything of value unless it’s for charity away.

I don’t want charity like that. I always believed that when a person apologizes, it’s mostly for their own elevation, when it’s sincere.

Even though I said I don’t care for apologies, I rather assure you won’t have to apologize again.
