**“Helping Hand” by Cesar Hernandez**

My friend Madison gets traded in for a younger model. Madison asks me to help her move out of the highrise. Andrew decides he doesn’t want a thirty two year old wife. He breaks off the engagement to be with a twenty five year old woman.

I have no interest in helping Madison move. I’m almost certain she has lots of stuff. She goes shopping every other day. Andrew and Madison have their four bedroom unit on the forty something floor. She is always koking how one bedroom is the clothes closet.

Madison is very hurt. No one knows the engagement had been called off. She wants to be settled in her new place before anyone finds out. Andrew wants her out ASAP. I can’t say no to Madison. I ask her if she needs me to rent a pickup truck. I know her Mercedes-Benz S-class nor my Cadillac CTS will hold all her stuff. She says she has a moving truck. All her stuff is in the basement storage unit.

I drive over to Andrew’s highrise. THere’s a huge moving truck at the side. I’m hoping all of Madison’s stuff is already in the truck. I tell the snooty doorman I’m there for Madison. I text her. Madison hugs me and leads me down to the basement.

There’s lots of stuff. Lots of boxes and lots of clothing racks. At least the clothing racks have wheels. The side door is very close to the basement storage units. I really want to ask Madison why she doesn’t hire a moving company. I keep quiet. I know she’s hurt and not thinking clearly. She really thought Andrew was the one. When they got engaged, she was so happy.

Her new place is close by. The apartment complex is brand new. Madison is on the second or third floor. Management says the side door closes at 4:30PM. We are not sure if we’ll make it. Madison has so much stuff.

She has so many clothes. Half of the clothes look like they haven’t even been worn. They are all designer labels. It is easily two hundred thousand dollars worth of clothes. It takes us many elevator trips. I ask her why she has so many clothes she hasn’t even worn yet. She says that when she buys something, she waits for the perfect event to come up. Sometimes she buys things six months prior to actually wearing it.

Management tells Madison it’s closing time. She sweet talks him. She tells him her engagement was called off three days ago and she got kicked out. He of course feels bad. He tells her to take all the time she needs.

We finally get all of Madison’s stuff in her unit. That’s when I notice she has no furniture. I ask why. She says they were supposed to deliver yesterday and they still have not shown up. She says she’s sleeping on the floor. I force myself not to laugh. I go out to the balcony.

She knows exactly what I’m thinking. She says she knows she had a better view at the old place. I say that from this balcony I can see the ants on the sidewalk. From her old place, you can’t even see the sidewalk. She comes out to the balcony. She does see ants on the sidewalk and laughs.

I ask how much she’s paying for the unit. She says the rent is two thousand. I tell her it’s a complete waste of money. She says Andrew’s place cose seven thousand dollars per month.

She is very thankful that I helped her move. She tells me to keep quiet for a couple of weeks. She wants to get herself together before she starts telling everyone she is no longer getting married to Andrew.
