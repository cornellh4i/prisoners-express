**"The Inexhaustible Source" by Robert McHale**

Oriental contemplatives seek forth measures of their own center; not to be,

In the ever quaint search of the all illusive fount.

Occidental Cosmo-mystics spy above the ambrosia, Aethers aloft,

Every spot overturned that unsurmountable mount.

Shoal of anemone, flocks of fish undulate the pounding aquatic;

A surface ripple, upon pond above to maintain.

Cerulean abounds, a sea for fleeted fowl to soar the airy azure;

The wayward wind; only, to cloudy welkin contain.

Flexing the effeminate ,springing from the sun nurtured soil,

Where all of her sculptured, vernal boles will spout.

Crest of Elysium hydraulics cyclical cycles rains hauled down;

Wells up to form, that old masculine's ever pouring spout.

Cornucopian grains camaraderie with pea-pod-cob; in unison

For water wrought kernel-n-corn every due, do dew drop.

Cloaked nocturnal secreted without our diurnal accouterments,

Star, nor moon ceaseless celestial spheres dare ever stop.

Blink of Shangri-La let's not us speculate of a future within,

Neither should we gaze without at inauthentic past.

Engage the elements embrace the ecumenical creation this day,

While we are right here and now or glimpse it last.

Envision the sliver of the utopia a splendid aggregate,

Reptilian herd rambling over rock, pebble, and stone.

For floral or for fauna the Edenic Keep amasses with the whole,

Whether hop, slither, or wiggle leave none alone.

Cold reflected is the mirror image just as reality in reverse,

Circular are the ardent capillary roots.

Bold refracted magnified glimmer from upon the upper shore to underneath,

Warmed the concentrated germ do render up the shoot.

Ancient arboreal trunk, limb, and nest the same hatchlings haven,

Daylight fed, only the insatiable starved.

Dendron are branch-n-bough immaculately twisted though they seem to appear,

All are at the whittlers hand every twig thus carved.

Congeries, coterie, collective be buds, the blossom, the bloom, and the spore,

Plethora are frond and panoramic are seed, reed, weed.

Amongst needle or leaf alike the beast; the acorn, the cone, and the nut,

Hoard does that vair to be, the Rex rodent of the tree.

Pelagic seaward wake unto wake "Rosy finger Dawn" will not thee forsake,

Clouds sail wither wherever, the wild wind blows.

Xanadu's chiseled retinues; rather retainers, firmed wall, or gouged step,

Abject the boundaries, not to be known; nor, to know.

Isolated within the immense, pity not the separate and distinct, it has always been right in front of usâ€¦

See it! Amen!
