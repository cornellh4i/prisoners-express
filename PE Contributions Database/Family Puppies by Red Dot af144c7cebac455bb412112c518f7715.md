***Family Puppies* by Red Dot**

I once lived in Denver and had a black pitbull named Blacky. He ran away, and then I went out and got a new puppy, a grey one, a pitbull. I named her love. Then about a year and a half I saw 3 dogs in my backyard. Blacky and a black and white wolf, and a little puppy. Love was barking and jumping around. They walked over to Love and started playing. Blacky walked up the backstairs and scratched at the back door. I came out, kneeled down beside him, and petted him then the little puppy came over. Blacky this is your kid? I played with the black and white puppy, and then the big wolf came over, sniffed me, and laid down next to Blacky. I ran inside to get bowls of water and some leftovers. They ate all the food. Love had some friends, and the little black and white puppy got Love pregnant. They had beautiful puppies--what a family, growing, running and coming back worked out.
