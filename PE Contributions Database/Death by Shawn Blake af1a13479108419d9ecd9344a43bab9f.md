**"Death" by Shawn Blake**

Even though this picture of a woman in a Burka holding in her arms what seems to be a dead man was hard to read -- I let myself be influenced by the recent Ebola epidemic in North-Western Africa. The lady looks like she is Muslim and possibly a healthcare worker. So I have written as if it she who is narrating.

Death.

We all succumb to it in the end. We are born and even as we grow up and develop, we are living to die. What happens afterward has several possibilities depending on one’s theological beliefs or lack thereof. But my concern now is more with keeping people alive and healthy as long as possible. It is too late for this man. His fight has ended and Ebola has won another battle, taking him to his final state earlier than he was supposed to go. I am a red Crescent (Islamic version of Red Cross) nurse, and it is my duty to prepare my patient for burial. I do this in the Islamic way; not knowing his beliefs I’ve honored him the only way I know.

The Ebola virus has taken far too many from us. But we are finally starting to win the war against it. My patient’s death, as well as all the others like him, have not been in vain. We are learning from this epidemic how to contain the virus from spreading. We can treat more and more victims, even saving many lives. Medical researches have created working vaccines to prevent people from catching Ebola, and now there are more efficient facilities with better sanitizing equipment. There are even new medications that can cure the afflicted…

Without biological materials that have become available, none of these innovations could have been discovered and developed for years, if at all. Still, it is a high price we have paid. Of course, there are still deaths every day, but fewer every day as well. We deal with the situation and learn what we can. When I see someone recover I feel like I have helped a little.

I finish preparing my patient and fold the shroud closed to secure it. I thank him for his sacrifice and let the waiting orderlies take him away. Another patient is brought forward as I clean up the area, change the bedding, sanitize everything, and wash up. Hopefully, this person will recover. My new patient is a little boy of about four or five. He looks so small and helpless on the stretcher, but he is obviously doing well. As he is transferred to the bed he smiles up at me shyly. I smile back as I look over his chart. He is already past the worst and is responding well to the new medication. He will recover. With an ironic grin, the thought that he will be slowly dying for decades as he lives his life out flashes through my mind.

I slip him a chocolate bar.
