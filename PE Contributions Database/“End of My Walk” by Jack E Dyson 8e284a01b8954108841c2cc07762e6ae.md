**“End of My Walk” by Jack E. Dyson**

I stare down at my reflected unblemished face. The depths of the cool water swallowing my image. How easy it would be to slowly lean forward toppling and sinking to the dark sandy bed. Alas, I am too much of a coward, tp tale a coward’s way out. I like to think it’s the majestic beauty that kept my feet shuffling down this old and long wooden jetty. Only stopping when a stray piece of wood splintered into the sole of my foot. Then once removed I continued my stubborn and arduous journey. Seeking to rest my sore aching feet. Languidly, dipping them in the mirror-like surface as I stare out, beyond. I am weary and although I sit, my cramped muscles and aching joints scream their agonized protests. However, as I gaze deep into the blue at my reflection, it all slowly fades. Everything, except the crispy cool breeze and sweet memories. Unexpectedly, I am jerked out of my peaceful state. My reflection grasping my ankles dragging my down to the bottom. Sinking me knee deep in the mucky bed. At least the water is clear. I force myself to watch the beautiful view that led me here. My lungs burn as black dots dance across my eyes. I regret nothing. The long walk was worth the meager amount of time spent in awe at the splendid view, sitting on the end of the jetty.
