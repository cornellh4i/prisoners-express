**Leon’s Word by Anonymous**

I can still hear the Midway Chicago security ask the repeated question. “Leon, Leon! Is this legal?” Leon seemed less excited about his job. It was pre-9/11. A Gerber Gator raised some eyebrows. Apparently, lockbacks weren’t so common off the rural route in Chicago. I can’t tell you how tore up I was about that. I looked at Leon like, “Come on.” Surely he wouldn’t wanna be the police.

Then, in my carry-on, more trouble. Two gallon zip-lock bags of powder. One white, one a mild orange tint. Leon, would a drug trafficker with a knife be chased by the Chicago P.D. through the terminal on roller blades? Seriously. That’s just unreasonable. “Why’d you run?” He asked.

“I had my headphones on,” I replied, “can I leave now?”

No, he said, as I’d only be allowed to void my airfare and leave the terminal. Leon looked like some straight up police pullin’ out a test kit. One smells of bananas, the other of oranges. I pass! So much easier than math class.

Then I have the metal detector to go through. The woman stops me, though she looks more like a girl. “What’s that?” She asks me. I blink and look around. “What’s that?” She repeats. “What is that?”

I said, “Please don’t.” She goes over my pocket with a wand. I ask again if I can leave. She says only out of the airport. So she instructs me that all items were to go into the change bowl. So then I say, “Please don’t.”

She said, “Why?”

I tell her, “Because it’s embarrassing.” Then she asked what it was again. We go back and forth with this stuff. I realize it’s Chicago. Problem is, she does too. I got through the storm with unorthodox strategy. I’d simply forgotten to shift the item beforehand to a more appropriate location. I’d have been better off being more focused. Instead I brought a discman and rollerblades.

So if you don’t want to get arrested in Chicago, don’t play with TSA, as Chicago knife laws are fascist. And don’t get foggy. Not all will go for this. I got real lucky thanks to her and Leon. Otherwise, “I’m just a student” wouldn’t have worked. Do put anything embarrassing in checked luggage. Especially if you aren’t supposed to have it. No, it wasn’t sexual, though stupidly embarrassing. I wasn’t embarrassed, up to that point.
