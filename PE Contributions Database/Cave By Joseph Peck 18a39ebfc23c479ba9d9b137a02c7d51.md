**Cave By Joseph Peck**

Sunday, August 7, 2050

I am writing this to anyone who survives this pandemic. Things are happening fast. I still have to make at least 4 more trips to Sanctuary. This world shattering event started when the space transports Galilean 23 broke up in the stratosphere. Later we learned that it was bringing back 1700 pounds of new ore found on Ganymede. As it turned out, it harbored a previously unknown virus. It’s silicon based! It should not be able to infect and replicate in a carbon based host, yet it is. It’s like nothing we have ever seen before, never even thought possible.

There were deaths in every country within a week. It took us two more weeks before we knew what we were dealing with. By then, more than 170,000 people were dead. Incubation took 6 to 9 days. The rate of infection was less than the common flu, but once infected, death was certain. The only sign of infection is headaches. This virus is somehow able to bypass the brain blood barrier by sending a chemical into the brain that attached onto the synapses. Once in the brain, a short circuit occurs. This mimics a grand mal seizure, death follows within the hour.

Lockdowns, face masks, and quarantines were all implemented. It did no good. The virus spread, more people died.

I worked at Mount Olive Pharmaceutical. We, along with the rest of the world set out to find a vaccine. We were working blind. No one knew where to start. A researcher in Israel hit on looking at an enzyme originally found eating plastic in a landfill. It was genetically modified to instead eat silicon. The molecules it uses to dissolve the silicon was used to make the vaccine. We at MOP ran our own test, we were rushed as everyone was. People were dying in the street, in their homes, and in their cars. Few made it to a hospital, and it was little help. We had to move fast. 13 weeks after the transport broke up, there were 100 million dead. I, along with my lab found that the vaccine did render the blood clear of the virus, but that was in and of itself troubling. We should have seen the dead virus. We did not raise a formal notice of inquiry, but thought it should be studied further. The vaccine was rushed into full production. Our government, as well as the entire world wanted, needed to stop this virus. The vaccine trials were cut short. I still had my doubts.

I had a hard time getting the supplies to Sanctuary today. I have been packing them in old medical supply boxes and traveling different routes so I don’t have to go through the same checkpoints each time. I have my travel voucher, but even a doctor will raise suspicion if traveling out of the Zone too often.

At first the vaccine was offered as a voluntary participation. The public did not trust that it was safe, so much hype about how it was rushed and trials cut short. I was still running my own test, even though it was in post production for mass distribution. When less than one quarter of the population lined up for the vaccine, the government passed emergency legislation making it mandatory. Chaos ensued. Riots broke out. Marshal law was enacted. All state’s National Guards were federalized and along with active military units, checkpoints were set up in and out of every major city. Everyone that was inoculated was given a government issued travel voucher. Anyone caught outside of their home without this voucher was detained and inoculated. The entire medical field was the first to publicly take the vaccine. I was not convinced that it was safe, so I changed the labeling on the vials for my department. I would not allow myself to be a guinea pig.

When the force immunization was first being talked about I liquidated all my assets. Sold my stocks, house, cashed in my 401k and started buying camping gear. All markets were down, inflation was rampant. I was lucky enough to get 20 cents on the dollar. I bought portable solar rechargeable batteries, freeze dried and dehydrated food, salt, several first aid kits, anything I thought I would need. I already had my guns, but I bought over 2000 rounds each for my handgun and rifle.

I found Sanctuary, a cave, when I was hiking a couple years ago. It had a natural spring, so water was not a problem.

Today is the day I disappear. As I stand here looking out for the last time, I wonder if the years worth of food will be enough for the virus to run its course and die out. I need to lie down, I feel a major migraine coming.
