**"A Christmas Fix" by Ross Hartwell**

A recessed doorway acted as a manager for birth into the deepest love I’ve ever felt. The Magi, a pretty red-headed do-gooder, arrived curbside bearing three gifts. A sack of homemade cookies and something to keep me warm this Christmas night. After gobbling up the sweets, I traded the sleeping bag for a dime bag, hence the third present. I didn’t need a blanket, I needed a Christmas fix. It would be my last. The ‘horse’ I’d been riding finally tuckered out. Life’s distance would be too enduring without a replacement for my one-trick pony. The next stop was for help, yet the assistance garnered only prolonged the seeking of salvation. A fantastic faux pas would have been nice in exchange for the shit I was to step into, but the ashes from those bridges had grown cold, eons before. Little did I know, that an affair, such as I was to begin, would take me for a ride through an abysmal place, never before seen within the grimy cracks and crevices of the dungeon I’d just crawled from.

Haley and I met in drug rehab. She was an intern, and me the patient. The euphemism, ‘kickin-it,’ should be given way to progressive truism because it kicked my ass while this angel did everything for me, but wipe the aforementioned. For all I know, she may have squeezed the ‘Charmin’ a time or two in assistance to my absent-minded movements. After three days and nights of relentless sweating, cramps, chills, constipation, dry heaves and foaming feces, not always in that order and at times all at once, the veil lifted.

A helpless newborn duckling, I became immediately enamored with the first vision hovering above my sickbed. After initial detoxification, my physical health quickly perked up, then day by day grew stronger, along with an unhealthy infatuation with this woman who wore a ring. My wants and needs became switched, diluted and ultimately combined. With the lack of heroin, the inner being grasped onto a subjective heroine. The affair DNA was perpetrated by a smile, a casual touch and ears tuned to the need for an outer body crutch. It began early on in my stay but wasn’t consummated ‘till the day I was discharged.

From the first until the last voracious inter-minglings, we believed fate had intervened, quenching essential thirsts of two parched souls. We played rendezvous roulette ducking and dodging the husband, their parents, the relatives, and their many friends. After six months or so, the day came when the ball dropped on thirteen, uncovering our contemptuous ruse. Even after Rob found out, we kept spinning the wheel as if gambling wasn’t a loser’s proposition. I myself wasn’t doubling down after learning her father was an ex-prison guard. I was an ex-con, challenging the two original men in her life. Nothing was to stop us. I needed her to breathe into me the fallacy of a wishful romance. She needed me to bleed the reality of her doomed marriage.

She lost her internship after the rehab caught wind of the indiscretion, which then led to forfeiture of her scholarship. Her family and all but one of her lifelong friends abandoned her. He stayed true to the vows he had taken. Even after a nervous breakdown causing a lost job, both contributing to their home foreclosure, he was an unyielding terrier.

Some nights she’d have me stay in the woods behind their house to witness and quell the unapparent beatings. It was fallacious reasoning. She wanted me close since I’d started drinking again. Was the ‘H’ next?

Two years from my miraculous birth from mother heroin, as I trudged toward the Pizza Hut to meet her for our makeshift holiday dinner, I considered the damage our love had caused. I, a stranger to this town, could walk away. But she was in my bones, nothing but divine intervention would separate us. After spending the prerequisite time with family, she would be there. Always early arriving at our appointments, I expected to see her Ford in the parking lot. The familiar lit up red sign beckoned. Something told me it hovered not over an oasis. Hotels and halfway houses were my homes. Being that this was the last place open Christmas evening, it would be the only place for two people like us to meet.

After ordering a Canadian bacon and pineapple thin crust and a pitcher of beer, I sat and drank while waiting. With half the pizza and a second pitcher gone, along with a dollars worth of sad songs on the juke box, the realization had sunk in. I’d been Judas kissed as our plans were promised. The booth became a confessional. As I peered through the plate glass, an iron overcast horizon intermingled with a jilted reflection; itself far from sainthood. Had the Last Supper been served? With reservation and no ‘Simon’ to bear the load, I walked away. On its second anniversary, essence was crucified. After fourteen years, Easter has yet to come, but its shell preserves. End.
