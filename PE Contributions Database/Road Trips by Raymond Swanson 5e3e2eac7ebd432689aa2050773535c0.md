**"Road Trips" by Raymond Swanson**

A road trip to me is driving for more than a couple of hours, whether it be a long-distance or right around the home, whether going somewhere planned or nowhere in particular. Just seeing new things, places, and people, or even catching up with old ones, is what truly matters. The trip doesn’t have to be any specific length of time or distance. Simply learning something new or spending time with the loved ones you haven’t had hardly enough time with is what makes the trip so uplifting. Holding their hand the entire time, knowing how lucky you are to have them, and the freedom just to be out driving around, going nowhere.

Turn on the radio and wait for that song you always hear when you’re together, then let them surf the channels, finding more for you to sing along to, humming the words you don’t know.

Halfway across the state or a hundred mile drive around the reservoir. Watching for bald eagles or counting cars that pass, or checking another fire station off your list. It’s the time itself that counts. To have nowhere to go and all day to get there and have no anticipation of what to expect is a truly wonderful feeling.

Cruising a country two-lane, kicking up dust out in the sticks or exploring the former right-of-way of a now-defunct railroad. Pulling over to pick newly-ripe wild blackberries or witness an old school hay baling operation, thinking back on simpler times. Taking detours to avoid construction, not caring where they go, knowing a left or right will carry you on. Racing a sunrise or chasing a sunset, trying to get to that perfect spot you know is just a little further, knowing how great it will be and ending the night with a kiss before driving home hand-in-hand in the moonlight.

*This writing was based on a relationship I had and all the day trips and “road trips” we would take. Whether it was Pittsburgh, Niagara Falls, Horseshoe Curve near Altoona, Harrisburg for the annual Fire Expo, or just a couple hours driving around the Allegheny Reservoir and stopping to take in the signs at Kinzua dam and Rimrock overlook or “detouring” to see the falling Kinzua Viaduct.*

*Hand in hand, radio cranked up, windows down; the wind blowing her hair, deflecting from her foot on the dash, sunglasses on. She always laughed at my Eric Church-like aviator sunglasses. With no cares and no worries about gas prices, we’d drive on and on. Sometimes we’d take a couple friends, but our best days were together. Plus, I had the girl.*
