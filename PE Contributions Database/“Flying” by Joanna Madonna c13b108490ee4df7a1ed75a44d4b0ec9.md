**“Flying” by Joanna Madonna**

I should be terrified to fly. It only makes sense considering that I have been plagued by a paralyzing fear of heights my entire life. I mean, it’s so bad that I can’t watch someone look down from the top of a building in a movie or on T.V. I can’t even read about it in a book without feeling like I’m going to fall.

So, naturally you’d think flying would be out of the question for me. But it’s not. I don’t understand it myself but flying has almost had the opposite effect on me. I feel held. I feel peace. I feel awe and safety. Weird, right?

I’m going to have to give credit to my dad on this one. He owned a gas station in New Rochelle. He worked 6 days a week, was gone sun-up to sun-down. But on Sundays, his one day off, he would pack my brother and I in the car early in the morning and take us out to the Westchester County Airport. I was little, couldn't have been more than 4 of 5. I don’t remember a lot of talking. I just remember a sense of watching and waiting and our reward was the take off and landing of the planes. I have to believe it was my father’s sense of reverence that infected me. This was his Church.

I didn’t get it at the time but as I got older I learned my dad’s story. He had been a pilot in WWII. He was trained as a bombardier navigator by the age of 20. And he loved to fly. Later in life he could describe with minute detail what the experience was like. The instrument panel. Propellers. The noise. The cold. He couldn’t remember if he had eaten breakfast but he could tell you exactly how it felt to “shoot a landing.”

I have no qualms about admitting that my dad was my everything growing up. Even through the worst of “the drinking years,” I saw him as my hero. And that’s why, as I prepared to board a plane for the first time in my life at the age of 19, I shared every detail with him. He prepared me. I was excited, eager- almost breathless. And I had no fear.

This is where it all gets kind of fuzzy, though. Because, by 19, I was a full blown addict. I was taking this trip with 2 of my using buddies. We were headed to the Dominican Republic. I remember (vaguely) lots of beer and weed the night before our flight. We felt so grown! This was some luxurious, jet-setter adventure we were undertaking. Me! This no one from Thornwood, NY- headed to the tropical beaches of the Carribean!

I don’t remember much about that trip other than the blowout arguments between me and my “friends”- (oh, yes, and some bus boy asking me to marry him- I suspect that was more about citizenship than true love, though). It was so intolerable that, after 6 days, my parents bought me a ticket home, a day early, so I could escape from these horrible companions of mine- (seriously? How bad could it have been that I would ask my parents to fork over all that money to fly me home 1 day early?? I wish they were still alive for me to ask them)

I flew back alone.This would be my first “geographic cure.” I was stoned, hungover, and depressed. I flew out on a REALLY SMALL plane. This one had propellers. We had a layover in Puerto Rico where I ate something called a chiro. An hour later, I was in the bathroom in the San Juan airport losing all of that poor little chiro (the animal lover in me would never eat goat again).

After a few hours it was announced that we were approaching NY, that we all needed to put out our cigarettes (can you believe that was only 30 years ago???), buckle up, and prepare to land. JFK or LaGuardia, I’m not sure which. But what I remember clear as day was seeing NY for the first time from the air. The skyline. The grid of streets and buildings. The coastline and bridges. NY. I had never had such a sense of rightness- “this is my home. NY. This is mine. It washed over me and reached out even in the midst of my crummy 19 year old drug and alcohol fogged brain. Descending. Wheels down. Approaching the runway with a roar. We bounced one and then are on the ground. The pilot didn’t “shoot” a perfect landing (Dad would laugh about that- “hot shot commercial pilots”). But we arrive. It’s over, my first adventure. My first grown up vacation. And I will never forget the thought that crept up on me as I prepared to step off that plane. “I can’t wait for my next flight.”
