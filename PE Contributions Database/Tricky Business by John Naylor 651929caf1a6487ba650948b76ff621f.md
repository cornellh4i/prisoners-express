**Tricky Business by John Naylor**

My hair used to get cut at the “Plaza Barbershop” in Anderson, Indiana ever since I was a boy. They were reasonably priced, talented and nice folks. A generational family business. They had a light-hearted side. One day, I fell prey to the humor. There’s a pop machine I often fed to drink a coke as I read a large assortment of magazines. All curious titles for the most part like “Popular Science” and stuff like that. A few more sports magazines I didn’t care to view. Though I’d see a “Outdoor Life”. My kind of sports. So I see a coin on the floor. It’s in front of the pop machine. Am I going to pick it up? Heck yeah, I’d pick it up if it was a quarter same as I’d pick up a penny. Keeping eyes peeled for a vulnerable state I may be in.

Wait. It won’t give. Dried corn syrup would melt in tap water. Especially if I used a little hot soapy water. So anyways I’ll kick it loose. Just my tennis shoes. Hm, nope. Ok, go go mini ball lock pocket knife. An accurate stab at the base and it pops up. Strange. Everyone is watching me. I feel it. Ok, what’s the punchline? Kevin Bark superglued it there as a joke. Oh, well, sorry. Maybe should’ve said something. I offer it back to him. He said “No, you’ve earned it.” Smirks of other patrons felt empowered somehow. I could see the smiles tryin’ to get out. Feeling empowered by my act it seemed. Vindicated! All in all, it’s a story of a tricky business, a business in which I came out on top.

I heard the “Plaza Barbershop” in Anderson is now closed. So many memories. And fine yet affordable haircuts used to be around $5.00 in those days. Good luck finding better prices for quality. That’s like prison prices! I urge everyone to support these small, out-of-the way lower-rent barbers. I think you’ll be glad. Old guys have cut a lot of hair. They know their way around it. Even if your cut happens to be tricky business. They deserve your business over less talented, store-branded barbers. If this was similar to some past barbers, thanks for keeping America looking good. Never give up.
