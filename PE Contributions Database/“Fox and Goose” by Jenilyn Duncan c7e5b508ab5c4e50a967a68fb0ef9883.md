**“Fox and Goose” by Jenilyn Duncan**

The fox was strolling along, pushing the goose away from her goslings in an old pram towards a grocery store.

“Where are we going?” asked the goose.

“To the grocery store and my house so you can meet my wife,” said the fox.

“I don’t want to meet your wife, but I need crackers at the store for my goslings,” the goose said.

“When we check out from the store, then we’ll see where you’d like to go.”

They continued on their journey through the store for Lipton soup and crackers.

“I’m stuck in this pram. Would you help me please?”

“Not a chance.”

He dashed out of the store with the soup and crackers toward his house with the goose in the pram. They made it to his lair with his wife. His wife said, “Looks like the goose is cooked.”

The goose struggled for a moment; then, with all her might, she got her wings freed. “Thank heaven. Keep the crackers.”

The moral of the story is sometimes we go along for a ride even when our life is in danger!
