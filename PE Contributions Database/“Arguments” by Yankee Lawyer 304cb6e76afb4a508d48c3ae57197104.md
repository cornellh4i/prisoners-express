**“Arguments” by Yankee Lawyer**

Thousands of Americans are in prison because of arguments.

My arguments got me a life sentence.

In an unfortunate colloquial sense, people argue with each other, raising their voices, using profane language and verbally abusing each other. Rants, slanders, and threatening or offensive body language occasionally lead to assaults, battery, and prison terms.

I avoid such unChristian behavior.

I am known, on the other hand, for my clear and convincing arguments.

Sound arguments are essential to effective communications.

First, the thesis must be clearly stated. Antagonists frequently put opposing spins on the issue even before presenting any relevant arguments. Liberals are known for restating issues and appealing to emotions rather than logic. This dishonorable tactic is often effective if the target audience is sufficiently egocentric and gullible. It has worked well in the abortion debate, in which intelligent people focus on the real issues of an innocent human being’s right to life and the duy of adult to protect defenseless people; liberals reframe the issue and rail about the tangential (how is this even relevant?) issue of a woman’s “right to choose.”

Then, carefully chosen facts must be stated. Theories, opinions, and suggestions are OK if they’re mutually agreed upon. A common error is to assume common ethical values. When I was struggling to get away from Tabor C.I., a common response to my request and complaints was that TCI was the safest prison in the State. Our enemies cited no reliable study in the support of that dubious proposition, but the major problem was the underlying assumption that I valued “safety”. What I want is for guards to mind their own business and leave me alone.

Finally, the proponent must show how the proven or agreed facts support his thesis. Avoid non sequitors and other sophisms. Direct proof is best but often proof by exclusion of the antithesis is more readily attainable:

A or B; not (A and B)

∴ A ↔ B̅; B ↔ A̅

∴ A

Prior to my arrest, almost all my writing was in support of notification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the human right of a baby to the care, nurture, and protection of his parents. The D.A. was working on behalf of a prostitute and a good ol’boy-veteran child pornography producer. He argued that three children should be tortured for fun and profit, and their protective parent (me) should be locked up. Predictably, the jury agreed with me; I was acquitted of three out of three charges.

So why am I in prison? In an argument, no matter how much evidence a poor boy has or how sound his logic or how convincing his argument, nothing speaks louder than money.
