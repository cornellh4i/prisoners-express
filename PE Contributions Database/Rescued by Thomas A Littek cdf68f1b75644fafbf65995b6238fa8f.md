**Rescued by Thomas A. Littek**

Call me loner. The tag fits impeccably; so, I’ll take no offense if you use it. After all, I am one who steers clear of almost all prison diversions - gambling, gossiping, rumor mongering … AKA ordinary prison recreation.

Not that I’m a snob, a recluse, or an anti-social type. No, mostly I am nauseatingly outgoing and friendly. I love edifying conversation, good-natured company, and all kinds of social activities. But, I’m also quite comfortable within the space of my own head, alone, with just my thoughts and imagination for companionship. Around here I’m well-known for saying, “If I want intelligent conversation, I’ll talk to myself.”

In prison, negativity and adversity abound. It’s as though they take wing, constantly dashing to and fro, constantly, from every possible direction, like a hornets’ nest poked with a stick. Hate without cause, violence sans reason, racism, gangs, jealousy, prejudice, and always an abundant measure of simple mindedness. In a flash, seemingly harmless activities, a game of spades, for example, can turn ugly. Openly risky situations, e.g., too many “friends,” gambling, horseplay can get you hurt. So, I prefer to fly solo. To that end, I make every conceivable effort to avoid all things risky.

I cope by writing. The moment I started writing, I knew I found my catharsis. I also learned that when I didn’t have an invigorating story from Camp Prisoney Land to delight and enchant me, I could look inside my head and find a tale from the Graybar Manor.

Night is my time to write. I sleep through the days to avoid the grind and commotion. I have taken deliberately to this habit and found meaning in my humble existence. I suppose you could say writing rescued me from drowning in the fishbowl known as Graybar Manor.
