**Life’s Purpose by Douglas Griffith, Jr**

Interesting! Life’s purpose puts a different spin on the question of purpose of existence. I had never given thought to this topic, but now I will meditate on this topic in order to elucidate its meaning for me.

The way I used to think was… what is my purpose in life. However, now the tale has turned… What is life’s purpose for me? The first question focuses on what I will accomplish in life has afforded me. Life’s purpose is an excellent way to deal with the question of existence. What does lfe have for us? Nothing makes more sense to explain life’s purpose than the Bible because the issues life throws at us lose meaning and we become hopeless with the promise of eternal life with the Lords of Lords and King of Kings.

Life's purpose is limited, yet we desire to continue to live it. We may even fear death, especially if we are well off because we don’t want what the ultimate penalty for sin is — death. As it's clear that there is something missing even if we have all the riches in the world -- that is -- a connection with Jesus. That is life’s purpose. That we surrender, completely, to the author of life and its purpose for us - Jesus. We will never really have peace until we embrace

Isaiah 26:3-

Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed in thee because he trusted in thee.

To think contrary to life’s purpose - Jesus - is to fall into hopelessness because jesus is our hope - 1 Timothy 1:1-

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope.

The evidence of hopelessness without Jesus is that we would just die in this life without anymore existence; therefore, live and do whatever because when you die that's the end of life's purpose. That puts fear into our hearts, but when Jesus and his promise for life's purpose after death are considered, then that gives us joy. Jesus loves us. Halleluyah!
