**“Rescued” by Sean McCarthy**

During summertime of 2003, my home was my sister’s couch for the past two years. Jobless, moneyless, loveless, and lost in the great big world of things, an addiction to Vicodin gets worse as a steady stream of suicidal thoughts begin to gain substance. One dark night, of course, highly intoxicated on pills, weed, and my new fascination with alcohol, the contemplation of killing off what miserable life I had left was being composed.

These thoughts were not new, nor had this need to leave behind everything ever surprised me. In fact, it felt almost destined for me to for me to follow through. For years already visions of myself dead, by my own hand, while my dearest of family members huddle around the carcass, of who or what I used to be have been ever so detailed that sometimes it feels like it’s already happened. Finally, after all of the build up the chill of a leather belt that’s been softened up with a fluffy white towel, so to reduce the physical pain, was tightly secured around my scrawny neck, and the super agonizing process of suffocation took place.

Slowly, as life is being sucked from my pathetic body, excuses look for reason and begin to clutter my mind in search for anything of value to grab hold of. “Why?” There are a ton of reasons. Death, loss, sorrow, pain, just grab a thesaurus, and look up these four words, and then use all of the other related words, and maybe they’ll help paint a picture of my childhood, which will help with a reason, well, that’s probably the bigger of the reasons. I do realize that life is rough, and it’s possible that some people could have it worse than me, but perhaps, they had the privilege of a friend or two during these horrendous moments of this mind-fuck torture. By the way, no matter how good they feel, drugs don’t fill the hollow gap of a warm heart or a soft ear to whisper in. Drugs are fun, but they’re not friends. People have left me stranded for as long as I can remember, and having nobody to confide in has become a way of life, I’ve grown accustomed to. One can’t just get over and on with problems, when it’s their entire existence that’s the problem.At this given time, a momentary lapse of reason, it was just about death and myself.

The heavy black leather belt was not that tight, however it was tight enough to restrict airflow to cause a slight lightheadedness. This was nowhere near the pressure that was required to do the job right. As I think this, I realize that I’m not as tough as I thought, and I am afraid of what is to follow life. Because, let’s face it, had I really meant to take myself out, then why not do it right? Hang myself, overdose, shoot myself in the skull, or even slit my little wrists. Quickly after this realization, I sought a way out of this predicament. Don’t call me a coward, because had it not been for my chihuahua on my couch, my haven, furiously licking my nervous, sweaty hand, I probably, definitely, might have followed through.

From the start of this ordeal, he was frantically bugging me by biting my pant leg, so relentlessly, and without a second thought, I naturally picked him up and let him roam around on the couch. As I watch him the immediate question of, how can I leave him, my dog, enters my head. Anxious flutters arouse.

Nobody can understand their disabilities such as I do. Ya sure, my sister will continue to care for him, and love him, but she’ll never understand his hidden pain. Mere moments until an inevitable lonely death take hold of me, and out of nowhere, this stud of a dog, because he is the definition of the term “horndog” and all one foot of him, loves all things female, won’t stop licking my hand, demanding my attention.

“What the cuk do you want?” I yell at mocho at three in the morning.

His desperate eyes simply say it all. “You”

An instant change in my entire demeanor was felt throughout my entire skinny shaky body. Tired tears flowed down my face as flashes of my forgotten family made their way into my selfish mind. Then, with only minutes to spare, life was pumped back into my lungs, while I reached for the comfort of my dogs weeping, uncontrollably into the comfort of their fur. They understood.

Okay, yes this story sounds a bit fishy, and the one other person in the world that listened to me tell it pretty much thought the same thing. That night thirteen years ago on my sister’s couch/ my bedroom, loaded out of my mind, with a note in hand, and a belt death-gripped around my neck, I chose, subconsciously maybe, to see what I needed to see. No, I didn’t see him talk to me, an animation episode, he just felt my pain, and somehow let me know that. A two-legged dog helped rescue me from almost certain death, and now I owe it to him to show the world his love. Mocho standing tall that night on his two back legs, opened my eyes up, enough to see a bit more truth that resides within our lives. We are who we are, inside and out. With all of our faults that plague our survival, open for the world to view, and for us to deal with. Be responsible for yourself while offering a hand to someone else in need, even if the hand is a furry stub. Every bit matters in those dark moments, believe me.
