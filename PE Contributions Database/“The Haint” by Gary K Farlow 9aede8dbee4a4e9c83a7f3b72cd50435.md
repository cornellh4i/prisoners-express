**“The Haint” by Gary K Farlow**

Every community has its share of ghost stories and Lake Swamp was no exception. Now granted, most tales of the supernatural are about half folk-tale and half pure imagination; usually invented for the benefit of passing away the long winter nights before television came along and abruptly ended the family story hour. Yet, if you sometimes dig deep enough, you’ll find that a few stories of ghostly spirits are actually based on real events.

It seems that right around the turn of the century in Lake Swamp, there lived a rather cruel and abusive overseer on my Grandma’s family’s farm. The Jordans had been tobacco farmers in the South Carolina low-country since before the Civil War, or as Grandma called it, “The War Between the States.” Thousands of acres were annually planted in prime tobacco and it took more than a few hired-hands come harvest time.

Clem Stonewall Jackson Thomas had been an overseer on my Great-grandfather’s farm since he could hold a whip. His father and grandfather before him had been overseers. Though the times have changed and treatment of farm labor with it, Clem just couldn’t fathom it.

“He’d ride the fields every day with that whip o’his,” Grandma told me. “If he saw a field hand stop just to wipe his brow or stretch his back, ol’ Clem'd ride up and crack that whip justs so the very tip would sting some area of exposed skin.”

My Great-grandfather had told Clem countless times that he just couldn’t treat the field workers like Clem’s grandfather had.

“The war’s over, Clem!” Great-grandpa would shout.

Clem simply would nod and then go right back to his old ways again.

“I reckon having the middle name of “Stonewall Jackson” made Clem feel he had to carry on the war,” Grandma said and shook her head. “But all the children were scared to death of him. I wouldn’t let nary a one of mine anywhere near that devil.”

If the old saying that people reap what that sow is true, then Clem had a load coming his way for a harvest!

Vigilante justice was not a new concept in South Carolina. No one to this day really knows who the culprit was or were, but when the body of Clem was discovered, about the only thing recognizable were the clothes he had once worn. And they were beat up pretty badly and soaked in blood. My Grandpa, David Williams, being the local sheriff, knew there was no point in questioning the folks around the farm because nobody “knew” anything. Even more important, nobody missed Clem once he was gone to that great field in the sky! The body was buried, but strangely, the clothes were buried just outside the barn.

“I think it had something to do with putting a hex on Clems’s spirit,” Grandma told me. “We had several ‘gitches’ around the farm who worked roots on people, and they must’ve been the ones who buried ol’Clem’ s clothes.”

It wasn’t long afterwards that strange things began to take place around the barn. Especially when a full moon was In. Word spread fast that the Jordan barn was haunted by the restless soul of Clem. Noone dared venture down the path to the barn after the sunset.

“The children would say ‘old bloody bones’ was in the barn,” Grandma laughed. “I couldn’t get one of my children to go down to the barn even to fetch the eggs from the hens. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t too pleased to have to go down there myself!”

Now it so happened that fall came a bit early one year. The depression was in full swing and times had been especially tough. The tobacco harvest had been a heavy one and it took every available pair of hands around the farm to help put it in to cure.

“Everyone of us, even me and the children, were working from sun-up to sundown to help put in that crop. We didn’t have time to even stop for a drink during the day,” Grandma said.

With everyone out in the fields, quite naturally, chores around the house took a backseat.

“We had completely forgotten about milking the dairy cow we kept down at the barn,” Grandma chuckled. “By the time we all got back to the house at night, poor ol’ Jasmine was bellering to beat the band!”

Jasmine was my Grandma’s milk cow. It was Jasmine who provided the farm with milk and butter which my own Mama learned to churn from the time she was able to stand. Not a day passed without the cow being milked or she ran the risk of her udder bursting. Jasmine operated like an efficient timeclock. If the day went by without anyone coming to relieve her of the “burden” then sure enough, old Jasmine would let out a deep, guttural “moo-o-o-o!” until somebody came to the barn with a pail!

Such was the in the autumn of 1932. Everyone had been out in the fields since sunrise and the need to milk Jasmine had just slipped the mind of Grandma.

Now the scare of the barn being haunted by the ghost of ol’ Clem had kept everyone away from the barn most of the time, even during the daylight. To go down the path to the barn at night was just unthinkable! But somebody was going to have to brave it or Jasmine wouldn’t survive the night.

“We laid up in the house listening to that cow for over an hour!” Grandma shook her head. “I couldn't bear to hear her suffer like that so I rounded up all my girls and said we were going to have to go to the barn and help Jasmine out.”

Grandma set off down the path to the barn with all nine of her daughters in tow.

“We were all walking arm in arm like a bunch of scared cats!” she laughed. “If we had heard a ‘boo’ I think we all would climbed a tree!”

Nobody stopped to think where my Grandma’s two sons had gone. It seems Uncles Kenny and Jay had just slipped out of the house unnoticed. So the last thing Grandma suspected was for anyone to be at the barn but Jasmine.

As Grandma and the girls neared the barn, a sight awaited them like never before.

“All of a sudden, this huge white think rose up from behind the hedges In front of us and you never heard such a sound!” Grandma said. “We didn’t none of us stop to think, look or give a second care about Jasmine. Everyone one of us just let out a yell and ran for the house!”

The “ghost” turned out to be none other than my Mom’s brothers, Kenny and Jay. As Grandma and the girls went running, Kenny and Jay fell Into fits of laughter, rolling around on the ground. The two had taken one of Grandma’s best sheets and attached It to cane poles. When the women came Into sight, they each took a pole and lifted the “ghost” up above the hedges and made noises to put a scare into the girls. Trouble was, Kenny and Jay were in for a little scare themselves.

“They didn’t stop laughing long enough to look over their shoulders,” Grandma said. “If they had, they would’ve seen Grandpa sneak into the barn.”

My Grandpa had seen what the two had done to Grandma and the girls so he felt that a little justice was In order.

“Grandpa found some old clothes In the barn that we kept for making scarecrows,” Grandma chuckled. “He took some red paint and smeared it on the clothes and put them on.”

Kenny and Jay didn’t see Grandpa walk up behind them. They were still too busy enjoying themselves. But when Grandpa let out a howl that would do any haunted house proud, the laughter ground to a halt.

“You never seen two more scared boys in all your born days!” Grandma laughed. “Them boys came running to the house like the devil himself was after them!”

Grandma put two and two together quickly. She realized that the “ghost” she and the girls had seen earlier was Kenny and Jay. Grandma didn’t know it was Grandpa who scared the boys, but figured that somebody had exacted justice for the scare they had given her and girls.

“Jasmine was still mooing up a storm,” Grandma added. “So I sent Kenny and Jay back to the barn to milk her!”

The boys were petrified to have to return to the barn after such a sight as old bloody bones himself. But Grandma would hear none of it. Needless to say, the ghost of ol’ Clem was kept alive and well for many years to come. I doubt that my uncles Kenny and Jay ever forget the night that their own “haunting” backfired and they became the haunted!
