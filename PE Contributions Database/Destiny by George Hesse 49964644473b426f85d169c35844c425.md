**Destiny by George Hesse**

Uncle Reggie/ Medicine man said “one will come”

Many warriors stepped up

But mother Earth remained angry

New viruses and diseases

Catastrophic records

Maybe this is it

Wouldn’t surprise me if the stars, moon, and sun changed

New natural disasters

As humanity we are failing Earth

Why? The Earth is alive

One will come

Hourglass is cracking

If only we could turn back the hands on the clock and watch

Where our true connection to Mother Earth was lost

We used to be one

Clean air, land, water

“One will come again who can talk”

Who will communicate so Mother Earth won’t give up on us

One with nature

Nature is talking

The one, she is born
