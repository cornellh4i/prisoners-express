**Thank God for Plastic by Darren Butler**

When I was young, I tried to burn down the house, and I forgot what was coming. It’s bad enough at the bus stop with dire imprecations around kids I don’t like, because of fighting everyday, and throwing rocks. Always winning the fights never seemed to matter. They didn’t need to hear how I messed up. It’s embarrassing to have faults, to appear weak.

After school the plastic cooking spoon is waiting. Nevermind not remembering that I had accidentally burned a small hole in the curtain. Just expectation of submission to inevitable justice.

Forget that. I’m running, well, walking. Slamming the front door behind me. There’s an old abandoned house in the woods nearby. Not good enough, too close to home. So walking down the highway, looking over my shoulder. Just in case.  I know Mom has to come this way to pick up my stepfather. Not worried about him, he’s always more reasonable. Just don’t want to be seen.

The next town over now. At the lake at the heart of it. Some kind people are convincing in their defense of the love and forgiveness of family. I guess I have to go home now. And face the inevitable, unexplained justice.

There it is again. The plastic cooking spoon. Thank God it’s not metal!

Years later, when I finally remember setting fire to that curtain, I’ve long since forgotten the string of inevitable justice. Even if it takes a while, the lesson can be learned, even as the pain has faded away. In the end, there’s no point in running.
