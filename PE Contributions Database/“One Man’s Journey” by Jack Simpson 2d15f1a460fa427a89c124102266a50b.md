**“One Man’s Journey” by Jack Simpson**

I stood at the Delta ticket line waiting to buy a one way ticket to Alaska. After I had retired, I sold everything I owned. I took all the money out of the bank and had only a change of clothes on my back. I would buy what I needed once I arrived in Juno.

It was a time when you see a sixty year old man buy a sports car to keep from growing old. What they call a mid-life crisis. At my age in the mid sixties, I was well beyond that.

Four years ago, I was told I had terminal cancer. What the doctor really couldn’t do, surely nature could. A trek through the wilderness was what I felt the doctor ordered. I really felt it was my time to howl.

I smiled as the ticket lady asked,

“Where to?” She looked at me kind of funny when I said,

“Juno please.” I paid here and stepped through the gate. There was no turning back now. Deep down I had no regrets as I took a quick look around. Knowing this would be the last time I would see this place. Not only would a great weight be lifted off my shoulders, I wouldn’t be stuck in no hospital with no machine to keep me alive. Much less be a burden to anyone.

It is a sight to see when you step off a plane in a strange land. It was really hot in Texas. Now I felt goosebumps that I had thought flew south for the winter. No wonder the locals looked at me strangely.

A T-shirt under a short sleeve shirt. A pair of docker shorts. I do believe the deck shoes were a little too much. I was thinking to myself, this was a very bad mistake.

The next morning I had already laid out my plans with no direction in mind. I wasn’t letting the locals know anything. If something did happen to me, I would be just fine. There was no-one to let me know I was missing.

I chose the life I had led. Never married or had kids. I once was married to my job. How do you get a divorce from it? That’s right, you retire.

The portable radio was really useless. It was of little comfort. If you found a station it would fade in and out. The mountains blocked a lot of the signal. The static made more sense than what I was getting. It sounded like a bunch of hungry mosquitoes. I had noticed the clouds were thickening and had turned a shade of gray. If my luck would hold out, it just might snow. That really didn’t bother me, I love snow a lot. A few yards ahead you could hear running water. That would be a welcome sight. I had a canteen. Fresh cold mountain water. I placed my fingers in it only to feel numbness in my fingers. I took a mouthful and started to swallow when my teeth started to hurt. I was worried after I had paid all that money to get them fixed a few years back. Would all be a waste.

Standing looking at the tree line. They could hold any danger. I wasn’t worried, my eyes were on the mountain ahead. I had never been to a place like this. Snow had fallen the night before. It was common for it to do that here.

The mountain seemed to be getting closer with every step. I didn’t realize it at the time. The human eye can see as far off as twelve miles. For me it could have been twenty and it wouldn’t have made any difference. Time is one thing I hoped to have plenty of. At least I had hoped so. My mind was made up. That mountain would be my final resting place. Vince Gill said it best,

“Go rest high on that mountain, for your work is finally done.” Isn’t that funny how one person’s tragedy becomes another’s haven?

Two days later I was standing at the foot of that mountain. My body was slowly getting weaker. Nothing was going to stop me.

Three hours later I was no closer to the halfway mark. Only a goat could climb this mountain fast. That was one thing I didn’t have. Resting a little and a light snack gave me new strength. My watch showed three PM. Soon I would have to find a nice place for shelter. The nights would be cold and windy. This time I had planned ahead. The thermal blanket would help keep me warm. No fire tonight.

The next morning, I was stiff. My legs hurt, my back felt out of place. If I had one more bone in my neck, it would be hurting as well. I had found places I never knew I had.

I reached the top, laid back in the snow. Took a good look around and felt close to heaven. For once, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep. I didn’t hurt anymore. All my pain was gone and I could see the other side.
