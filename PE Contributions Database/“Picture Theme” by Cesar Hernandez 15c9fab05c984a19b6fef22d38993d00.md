**“Picture Theme” by Cesar Hernandez**

Competition with others causes restlessness and keeps the majority of people in a state of anxiety. In an Olympic race, a Japanese swimmer won the gold medal. Second and third place were won by American and Russian swimmers, respectively. After the race, a journalist interviewing the Japanese winner asked, “In the lanes beside you were an America and a Russian-did you know that both of them had held the world record?”

He replied, “I didn't know.”

“Did you know that the other swimmers were close behind you, and the Russian once overtook you?” the journalist asked again.

From this we can understand that if we perform without fixating on what others are doing, we can achieve great things. If our mind is preoccupied with competition, we unwittingly try to imitate others rather than focusing on our own unique skills. By going forward with focused effort, not measuring our progress against others or worrying about what our peers are doing, we can obtain our own genuine success.
