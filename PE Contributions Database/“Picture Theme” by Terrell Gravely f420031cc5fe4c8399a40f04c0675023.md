**“Picture Theme” by Terrell Gravely**

Whoever he was that I thought I knew before this very moment bore little resemblance to the brute hovering above me now with bulging blood tinged eyes, seemingly strained to stay socketed upon his deep crimson face.

I literally felt the heat of his anger rush over me as he slammed shut the distance that had separated us in the old Ford truck front seat. I instinctively shut my eyes tight, quickly as if to hide inside my instant fright, behind this childish shield of darkness. What seemed like an eternity, but happened in the space of seconds, was also the imaginary image my father and I appeared: father and son on an early Saturday morning in fall of the harvest wood for the homefire, holographically shifting to what thereafter would illuminate our true portrait; etched in carbon it seemed ever present in the ethos of our relationship.

Fiercely and theatrically he stomped twice on the airbrake, upon which I stiffarmed the dashboard steadfastly; we had only just left our house and were not belted. I opened my eyes to his strong arm as it brushed past me to crank down the creaky door handle and his stern demand to “GET OUT”. As I opened my eyes and caught my breath, I slid out quickly from my seat into the neighbor’s driveway. Now facing into the cab, mouth agape, I did not dare to make eye-contact out staring at my scarf and gloves, still a prisoner.

As he dropped the clutch, surging forward causing the ajar door to swing virulently closed, I breathed deeply into the brisk morning Virginia breeze trying to steady my vertiginous state, completely shaken to my core by the sudden virocity of my father’s unannounced rage.

The offense: this 12 year old made the unwise attempt to bond in humor with his “Dad” upon realizing within a quick moment of leaving that an unmistakable odor existed in our small area and stated “So you farted”, a word not only forbidden in our home as a child, but still one today, 40 years later, that makes me feel uneasy when I hear it.

I had recently spent the night with a cousin and his best friend. His father: a large haul trucker and unpretentious as the day is long. I began to realize that what had only moments ago felt like a safe haven now felt like a place where I was unwelcome, unloved, and hated. I was nearly paralyzed in my boots by the event. As it began to constrict my chest I looked slowly around to see if anyone outside was awake, anyone who may have witnessed my standing there. But I was alone. I tried to swallow but I knew I was too rattled. I needed to cry so I began walking the block back to my house.

I went to our shed to cry until my mom left for her half day of work at her business, so she wouldn’t have to see me like this. This was the first time I had seen this deep hatred and rage that my father had been disguising...well, for my entire life, I guess.

Though I cried for at least an hour, travelling through emotions of anger, hate, self-pity, embarrassment and shame, the release of tears did little to erase the vividness of his face searing into my memory. Whoever said that “a picture paints one thousand words” should re-examine the image more aposteriorially. As I now know, after a lifetime of unleashing my father’s ire photo ops, that particular “f” word was just a first glimpse into his portfolio of seethe, not the cause-just a reason, an excuse.

My father and I tried to emulate normalcy, paint a picture of tradition. A father-son relationship, in my experience, can be the antithesis of serenity upon closer inspection.

I had originally “looked” at this picture of a fox pushing a goose in a baby tram. A natural predator/prey coupling to come off as “tamed”, a fox in seemingly adoration and service to what otherwise would be a feast. Hence, at first sight, I assumed they had been trained, bonded even and felt hopeful, giddy, sort of. But it’s deceiving. The picture belies an unnatural pairing to initiate a trust between these animals. However, upon closer consideration, I believe that the fox is tethered from his collar by a small “2-3” length of chain to the handle bar, forcing him to stay or hang. The goose is wingpineed or clipped as her feet look bound. The photographer is the deceiver.
