**"Simple Pleasures" by Marion Keith Boatman**

Life's simple pleasures are so overlooked until a time comes when they are no longer simple but instead a longed for treasure. Such treasures as a kiss on the lips from one you love. A treasure such as the smell of sweet scented hair. The fell of thick blades of grass against your bare feet, or flying a kite on a warm breezy day. Why all these things were taken for granted, simple pleasures indeed. You never know what you've got until it's gone.
