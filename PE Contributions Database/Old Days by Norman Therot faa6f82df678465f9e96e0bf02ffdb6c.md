In the old days, things were much simpler. People were different; one’s word was one's bond. Dignity and integrity were the main stamp of humanity. People excelled through hard work, and there was purpose to life.

Most cars had manual shifts. They had party lines on telephones, and CB radios were the way people communicated on the highways and byways of America.

There was respect for neighbors, and friendship meant something. Family vacations were treasured events. Fighting was done with fists not with guns.

In the old days, our children weren’t taught to be snitches in schools. We were taught to stand and fight for what we believe in--after all, if we don’t stand for what we believe in, then we’ll fall for anything. We respected our elders and our parents and would put our lives on the line for family and friends. Children were to be cherished, not abused; innocence was protected.

There were only a few channels on television, but families made up for it with games and outdoor barbeques. Fathers supported their families to the best of their abilities, and mothers took care of their children. Husbands and wives were loyal to each other for the most part. America was a country to be proud of.

In the old days, neighbors welcomed new neighbors to the neighborhood. Everyone looked out for each other. Gossip was everywhere though.

In the old days, there were tough times, tough people persevered and got through these times. There were no computers to depend on. Robots didn’t do the work of men. In the old days, a man could know true freedom. We depended on our own wits to find our way. There was no GPS: when lost, we would get directions. People for the most part were willing to help.

In the old days, the government was corrupt as it is today. It just wasn’t known about. There was no terrorism to speak of. Kids weren’t killed for their shoes or the clothes they wore.

People could worship God without fear of retribution or shame. It was acceptable. People pursued dreams with vigor - today? Why bother. In the old days, people didn’t tend to be violent, kids weren’t shot while playing in their yards or at class in school.
