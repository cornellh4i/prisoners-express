**Clothing by J.C. Holeman**

Clothes are stupid if you’re a rodent

But gerbils look great in hats

Shirts look ridiculous on dogs

But pants would only be worse

Tuxedos are awesome on little monkeys

But socks would be a dumb idea

Saddles for horses bear a burden

Of the weight of jailers

Handcuffs are bracelets for the loney

Confused, despondent, desperate and weary

Shackles break those not free to run

While chains weigh down each ounce of freedom

Heartache is the clothing worn

By prisoners, under masking uniforms,

Behind stone walls

Where there is no sun

Clothes are stupid if you’re a rodent

But gerbils look great in hats
