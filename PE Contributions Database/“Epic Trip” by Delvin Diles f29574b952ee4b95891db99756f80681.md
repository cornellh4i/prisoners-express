**“Epic Trip” by Delvin Diles**

Jalen was visibly excited, and Brian saw it in his friend’s eyes even before he opened his mouth, so he only chuckled when Jalen shouted, “Wait ‘til you see what I just printed, B!” Jalen’s overenthusiastic face was surrounded by a paused battlefield explosion in the center of the holo-space projected from Brian’s smartring. In mock anger, he scolded, “Better be good, fool. I almost cleared level 9 in BotWar 23!”

He’d slid to Jalen’s apartment door when he responded, “Man, this is epic! Besides, all you do in BotWar is get blown up.” Brian had been in the buffed, interactive corridor’s slow lane. In a pre-merged world, he would have jumped, stopped, or pivoted on reflex when Dej tapped his shoulder from behind.

Having been trailing Brian for several minutes from a distance, she’d eye-lens zoomed and eavesdropped. She warned him, “Don’t let yo’ stupid-ass homeboy neuro-hack you again, Bri!”

“Gotta go, J,” he blinked his holo off and switched into skate mode. After boarding the elevator, Brian said, “It’s going to be okay, Dej.” She was still shaking her head when the doors slid closed between them.

“Man, what the hell took you so long?!” Jalen yelled as they slid-stepped down the tribal-patterned hallway. His parents were both at work off-satellite, so Jalen could yell any kind of language and volume. While everyone else slides in mostly straight lines, Jalen often swerves just for the hell of it, even in corridors.

It often annoys people behind him, but a neural impulse app window called Person Ahead Trajectory Holosignal (PATH) displays for others the shape of his intended direction. When Jalen slid into a “(“ after his PATH showed “)”, Brian said, “J, yo’ neuros firin’ disinfo, bro. You better scan that shit.” Brian warned his friend, mindful of the threat of head-hackterrorists who’ve been known to induce suicides and self-tortures.

“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Jalen droned, sliding up to the old decommissioned spacejet. Once Brian was in the passenger seat, Jalen handed him a contact lenscreen holder. “Take your lenses out, put these in, and prepare to launch!” Dej’s warning resurfaced in Brian’s mind, and to Brian’s questioning, Jalen preached, “Look, B. Just ‘cause you pussy-whipped don’t mean you gotta be a pussy, too! Besides, I uploaded a whole diagram and description in the program. Just check it out!”

The simulation was a perfect illusion. They’d surged through earth’s scorched atmosphere, but Jalen juxtaposed that with an impossibly revived, repopulated terrain sans any anti-atom bomb craters and fallout. He’d also imagined a complete Dragon Island in the South China Sea. Soaring above the skyline, casting shadow on hyperloop tubes spiraled around mile-high buildings with shifting facades, hovering over a nude beach and supathick multi-racial women in a twerk mob, their gyration frames multiplied, zoomed, slo-mo’ed and rhythmically overlaid in a 3-D montage as Brian’s high became a literal, chemical one. That’s when Jalen’s face appeared on his cockpit’s sim-screen.

“Feel that, B?” Jalen was barrel rolling the jet now, enhancing Brian’s ever-increasing disorientation.

As the imagery morphed, twisted, and blurred, Brian answered, “Yeah, man. What the fuck was that?

Laughing, Jalen explained, “The best part of this trip, B! I infused some releasers into the lenses. I found this throwback chemical ingredient for a plant-data mining earlier. It’s fire, right?”

“You what?!” Brian was still trying to process what Jalen had done when he lost consciousness.

“Why would they even want to touch down here?” a medic asked his co-worker. His voice came through his earpiece slightly muffled, filtered through a mic-equipped oxygen mask. Looking through a haze of fallout dust at the crash site victims, he ignored the question. As he lifted one of the teenage boys onto his cyber-enhanced, biohaz-suited shoulders, he posed another baffling question. “Hell, what I want to know is, how in the age of thought recognition did these two idiots mobilize a decomm’d space jet in the first place.”

“Yeah. I still can’t wrap my head around that one.
