**“Thankful” by Christopher Sims**

Dear God, let me start off by saying I’m so thankful that you came down to earth and were willing to pay the ultimate price with your life to die on the cross. I’m so thankful for the sacrifices you made and all the hate you had to go through here on this earth for us. God, your love is plentiful and it runs deeper than any sea. Oh how I yearn to bath in it, to wash away this distasteful hate and filth. Please Dear Lord, forgive me of my sins. Have mercy on my body and soul. I crave to take a sip for the slightest drop would quench any thirst. For my soul is dehydrated from walking in this desert of sin. Dear God, please wrap me in the warmth of your love for I am suffering from hypothermia. I’m frozen with lust, hate, selfishness and I can’t proceed on this righteous path unless you throw me out with your warm everlasting love. Dear God, I realize a change is needed to be made in my life. Things are headed in the wrong direction. I see that changes on the outside behavior, looks, attitude don’t change me inside. That change only comes only through faith in YOU. You’re the only true one who changes my heart and makes all things new and for that I’m so thankful for you.
