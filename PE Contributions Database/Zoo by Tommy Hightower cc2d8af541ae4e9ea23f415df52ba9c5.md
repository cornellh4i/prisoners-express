**Zoo by Tommy Hightower**

I remember my childhood trips to our local zoo. I am from Sacramento California. My childhood was spent on the Broderick Side of the Sacramento river. Old Broderick was an alcove of dust bowl transplants from Oklahoma in the 1930’s. Being raised a country boy in the city, well I loved to spend all my time in a 3 mile long, by 100 yard wide wilderness zone between the Sacramento river, and the levee which protected us from floods. This was my zoo.

My zoo area had 150 cottonwoods. with a thick underneath, and bamboo catches. People over the decades had lost or acted free in this natural zoo all kinds of lizards, snakes, aquinas, rats, alligators, added to the leaves, rattle snakes, tree squirrels, and 100s of kind species.

We were poor, working class, so a trip to the city zoo was rane, and expensive. As my schoolmates and I would explore our own zoo, everyday, year round. We had our single shot 22, plus BB guns, fishing poles too! It was a real afane adventure.

Around 6th grade, 1970, we were big enough to handle hatchets and machetes. It was super thick under the threshold. As we would flage our own hiking trails, In fact, we got home adults to work beside us, and over 3 years, we cut several miles of walking trails that are still there today, 50 years later. It was a true nature area, where you can see all types of wildlife in its natural setting. We hid all the entrances, so that the winos, hobos, and criminals could not destroy our safe, clean, natural zoo. Every year, as the snowpacks melt, the river floods out the area. Each spring would deposit new wildlife. New growth would have to be cut back against to blaze trails for our community to enjoy.

I was blessed to grow up in a simpler time. A time when young boys could explore nature close up, where you felt safe and at peace

We frequently camped overnight. It was too great to be in nature at night. When you reached the river’s edge, you could see downtown Sacramento. With light a plenty, and lange paddle wheel boats cruising the river. Each year old replica ships sailed up to the area, and anchored on our Side of the river to avoid intruders. But we could just wade night up to these old time sail ships and climb aboard as we knew the crews.

These crews came from all over. Each year, another strange, exotic lizard or kind of make would get free and join our nature’s zoo. We had lizards from the South Pacific which run on two legs with that giant skin collar, flared over. I forget their name but definitely not from America.

My zoo had wild born, as well as aligarh not seen anywhere else. Other than a zoo in California.

Hey, admission is free but be ready to pitch in to clean trails and pick up litter. This was at Broderick zoo, a pool child's delight.

We are still very proud of our little nature zoo. Now old Broderick is gang riddled. Poverty and drugs around. Yet even today, our private trails are clean, safe, and the nature area is the same. That is because many of my schoolmates never left. As now they take their children, grandchildren too to see our Broderick Zoo.

You can never locate these places, as the last way to maintain our childhood wonder was to keep secret where it exists.

A small warning to outsiders to. You don't want to go exploring to locate my tale’s local. As Broderick oes keep somethings just how God meant them to be timeless today as it was back when I was a child too!

How about you? Do you have a childhood memory of that special place? We all do. At least I hope that’s true.
