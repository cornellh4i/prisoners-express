**Tuned In By Thomas A. Hightower**

Our universe has been said to be chaotic. That mass of atoms, without a designer, brought about life from chaos. For us with a religious leaning, believe in a designer who directed every atom to a set purpose. That leads to the creation of life and heavenly bodies. In short, all matter and antimatter to ever exist is tuned into a set of purpose; a pattern designed to compose all that exists today.

As the human species has learned the hard way, to lead life by chance leads to chaos. Life must be tuned in to a set, specific goal in order to achieve the best results. Yet most of the human race seems to never achieve the desired results sought after.

To take this even further, here in America we make-believe that we have a purpose to achieve a set of end results. Namely, the American dream. In truth, very few ever see their american dream come true. Why? Because as a society, we act like 350 million individuals all going our own way as the path to the same goal - the middle class American Dream.

We have no idea exactly what is going on in our world, country, neighborhood, or family. We are like a radio set off the station sought - it’s filled with static. You can not understand anything for the static-filled airwaves of our lives. We are unable to tune-in to the correct frequency we need to hear the music-harmony-of a well-tuned in life.

When 350 million souls attempt to each go their own way down the road to the same destination - middle class America - we end up running over each other we crash and clash all along the way and wonder why we arrive at old age still as far away from our dreams as the day we started.

When will our nation figure out that we all desire the same dreams in life. FOr us, our children, our country, we are all headed in the same direction yet fight each other the entire way.

If only we would realize that there are zero differences in us no matter our age, race, religion, gender, sexuality, or political leanings, we all have more in common than not. In order for us to succeed as a nation we must get in tune with each other and tune out our differences until we learn that it's our different strengths that can work together for the overall good for all.

We need to all sit down and make a list of everything we value in life, and beside it everything we dislike. Then trade lists with your political or religious opposites. Then count off how many values you each have in common. I bet you have a two to one similarities to differences.

These differences are where you need to work on. Which ones can you live with for the sake of the greater good? Again it's reasonable to bet we could learn to compromise with each other for the sake of the greater good of our nation, state, community.

So this is the challenge to all of you - take a realistic assessment of yourself. Understand that the largest asset of America is its diversities. These diversities have made America the world’s leader in innovation. We shall surely fail as a nation if we do not get tuned in to what makes us the most powerful nation on earth.

We used to be the envy of the world. A country all other nations aspired to become. Not anymore. Now, the world looks at us with horror as we set out to destroy each other over the same diversity that once made us strongest.

Say goodbye to the American Dream unless we wake up soon. We have become our own worst enemy. Our enemies are gleeful at America’s demise at its own hands. You can thank a divided nation for the destruction of the American Dream and our Freedoms.

Respectfully yours,
