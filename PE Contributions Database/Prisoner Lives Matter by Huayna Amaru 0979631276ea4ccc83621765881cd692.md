**Prisoner Lives Matter by Huayna Amaru**

It’s really hard when your doing time-

You’re out of sight, and you’re out of mind.

It’s waiting on visits, that never take place-

From friends and loved ones, who have forgotten your face.

Its calling and hearing a block on the phone-

Thats when you realize, you’re completely alone.

Its anger, pain, regret, and remorse-

Its feelings of shame, pain, and loss.

Its crying at night to hide the tears-

All that’s left to your life is misery and fears.

The days go on, no end in sight-

At the end of the tunnel, there is no light.

You try to remember where things went wrong?

You try to hold on, you try to be strong.

Memories haunt you, from times long past-

The clock keeps ticking, how long will this last?

Your life is over, when your doing time-

Because when you’re out of sight, you’re out of mind.

I write these words because I want people to understand the pain that incarcerated men and women have to endure, the loneliness, the solitary. I write this because I want someone to understand the definitive fact that Prisoner Lives Matter and that we need to know that our lives matter and that we will be accepted back into our communities. Somewhere upon my daily reflections I’ve come to realize that people need to know that they’re loved and that there’s someone in the world who cares about them, who understands them and who can relate to them in significant ways. Imagine being in prison, without that type of connection, without any real affection, love, or mutual understanding. In a bleak and bereft world like this, life easily becomes a purposeless, lonely and miserable existence. This is one of the reasons why I’m always striving to make more people aware of how important it is to build true, solid relationships between the people on the outs and the people in prison who are continuously going thru these painful struggles. We’ve been placed in prison and separated from our families, separating from meaningful relationships with the only people in the world who cares about us and we’ve been thrown into a warzone of deceit, corruption, negativity and destruction and we are forced to either learn how to swim or sink. We need letters, visits and people to accept our calls or else we’re left with trying to seek this “artificial love” and almost forced into finding this acceptance, belonging and safety in the self-destructive relationships and habits of gang culture and prison life. And thats just one of the reasons why people out there should be more willing to understand that “Prisoner Lives Matter” and that we need people and organizations to get involved in our lives, and in our struggles and to help us make it out to the other side of reality and to help give meaning and purpose to our lives.

To all the incarcerated men, women, and juveniles who are doing time, I want to take this opportunity to let you know that your life does matter and to never give up. As long as you know who you are and as long as you can continue to keep it real with yourself, then you will always be free, no matter where you’re at, or what situation you’re in stay goal oriented, because if you have nothing to strive for, you have nothing to live for, and setting goals and aiming to achieve them gives meaning and brings purpose to your life. You’re going to have haters and naysayers, people who deliberately try to bring you down and there’s gonna be obstacles in your way, don’t let it deter you. Stay determined no matter what. Stay focused no matter what. Its during this period of self-reflection that we should ask ourselves whether we are going to let this situation break us (mentally or emotionally) or make us psychologically. Because the things that break you can also be the things that make you and sometimes we might need to be broken before we can be made whole again. Keep the faith because faith is the head chemist of the mind. Prisoner Lives Matter! Your brother in the struggle for freedom, justice equality.
