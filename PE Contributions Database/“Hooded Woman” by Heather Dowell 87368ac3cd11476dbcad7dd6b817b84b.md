**“Hooded Woman” by Heather Dowell**

When I look in the mirror I see myself with a constant veil over my face indicating a constant state of mourning over the family and children I have lost. I struggle at times to keep my head above the water and see the positive possibilities of what the future may hold for me. For the first time in my life everything here is all about me. I am here to get better and grow as an individual, and it’s my turn to take care of myself instead of everyone else.

I struggle with self-esteem and undervalue myself but that is slowly changing. I am starting to notice there is more that meets the eye when thinking about myself. I am good at writing, drawing and being creative. I am really good at research and reading. I have found a higher power that enables me to focus on the here and now and not fret about what is to come. I will always have a hard life because of the choices I have made; however, with God in front of me, I will always feel love, peach and joy that will enable me to keep moving forward!

Before I came to Pocatello Women’s Correctional Center I was a feeble, fallible human and although the last part will never change while I am alive, I know I am no longer feeble and I have a lot going for me because I have faith that there is a purpose for my existence and I am determined to help as many people as possible. I am unsure how I am to help others so I continue to educate myself so I am full of wisdom I can utilize in my books!

I have learned to never give up and someday I will remove my veil and be proud of the person I am. I do not know what the future holds but I have faith God will reunite me and my children when the time is right. I am eagerly awaiting for that day to come!
