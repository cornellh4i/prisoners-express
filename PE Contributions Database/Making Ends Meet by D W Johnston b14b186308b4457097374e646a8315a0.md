**Making Ends Meet by D.W. Johnston**

People say a lot of dumb or just silly things here. Such as “oh prison saved him,” when they see me in the chow hall wolfing down a half dozen pancakes. No, I didn’t always have it so good, sometimes I smile and nod, sometimes I give ‘em the finger. Depends on the person and my mood.

In prison all your needs are provided for. Maybe not exactly in the way you like, but they are. Most of my life it’s been up and down. Sometimes plenty, sometimes not. I never concerned myself with the ends, or making them meet. I’m thirty-eight years old and have never lived on my own. Other than a cell phone, I never had a bill in my name. Eventually I will be released. How is prison helping me to become a useful member of society, and not a bum who lives off others as I’ve always done?

It isn’t, obviously.

I’m not about to rehash all the arguments against prisons, and the issues with them. You’ve heard them all, you agree, you are the choir, but I am not your preacher. This is not for you, it’s for me.

There is rehabilitation available to you (at least here in Texas) if you seek it. Although how do you rehabilitate something that was never good to start with. You may have to jump through some hoops, and you may have to want to change. How is this relevant? The idea is that prison is supposed to make you a productive member of society. One who can pay their own way, without harming others.

So that is what I’m working on. My biggest goal upon release, if nothing else, is to take care of myself. To pay my own rent on my own place. Even if it’s only a small studio apartment. Even if the only job I can get is mopping floors at McDonald’s. It will be nice to be able to sit there in my own place after work, knowing that I worked hard and honestly to get there. That I didn't have to steal or sell drugs for it. That instead of contributing to the problems of the world I actually did something to make it better. Even if it’s mopping floors at McDonald’s so people have a clean place to eat.

If that doesn’t do it for you, let me appeal to your pride. I’m sure you call yourself  a man, you likely walk around with your chest out telling people such (sorry ladies, I can’t pretend to know what you’re going through, or the issues that brought you here.). You may even walk around bragging about them hoes giving you money. You got “hoes” putting money on your books, hoes buying you clothes and paying your bills out in the world. What are you giving them in return? “Some D”? Nice gig if you can get it, but it doesn’t that make you the ho? Or let me put it another way, a woman (or man if that's your thing) is paying all your bills, cooking your meals, doing your laundry, etc… That’s not a spouse, that’s just another mother you happen to be having sex with (sophocles would blush).

You can’t take care of yourself, how do you call yourself a man? A man is an adult male. You may be male, but you sure as hell aren’t an adult.

The above describes me well (hi kettle, I’m pot), but unlike the pot and the kettle who can’t change what they are. We can. We can do better.

I wasn’t planning on writing on this topic, but after eighteen months of staying out of trouble I recently moved back to population, and when I woke up this morning, the college interest form I requested was under my door.

Did I mention I hate McDonald’s? Keep your mop and fries, I want a desk in an air-conditioned office somewhere.
