**"Road Trips" by Cesar Hernandez**

Road trips can be fun but also very stressful when a trip is taken with difficult people that refuse to compromise. Five of my friends and I decided we could not trust our girlfriends to drive, so three of us took the wheel. We only had a three-day weekend, so it was our goal to reach the Coast as soon as possible and enjoy the sun on the beach. It took almost no time to reach our destination. We switched drivers often and stopped only to fill the tank. We left on Thursday evening and got to the beach in no time. Our hotel rooms at the Holiday Inn had already started charging us at noon on Thursday.

The Holiday Inn was right on the beach near the end of the boardwalk. It was almost like being on a private island. We had complete intentions to never leave the beach; however, we ended up going to the ocean only once. Our hotel essentially had a miniature indoor ocean! The pool had large windows from where you could see the beach and the ocean. The pool was huge at about twenty by forty feet with a sixteen feet deep end. We ended up using the indoor pool all the time instead of the ocean that was merely twenty-five feet away. We had so much fun consuming nothing but pizza, beer, and vodka.

On the way back home we stopped at the outlet mall. The outlet mall had about one hundred fifty stores and about twenty restaurants. The only reason we stopped shopping was that we could not fit any more items in the trunk of the car. We even threw away the clothes that we brought from home to make space. We returned home with nothing but brand new clothes. Among the six of us, we probably spent two thousand dollars on products that retailed about a total of seven thousand dollars.

Going on that road trip was a great experience. Afterward, we would sometimes only drive the five hours to the outlet mall to shop. We would take a road trip to the outlet mall for about two or three times per year.
