**“City Trip” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

Now, spring break has begun.

I came to the city to have some fun

All the traffic and all the people in such a rush

Yet here I sit at a hush.

Eight of us came on this trip

But on me, depression has a grip.

It’s the first time I came to the city and maybe my last

I’m not used to everything moving so fast.

My friends are all at a bar

Yet I can’t go all that far.

Yes, here I sit, as lonely as can be.

All because I lost my I.D.
