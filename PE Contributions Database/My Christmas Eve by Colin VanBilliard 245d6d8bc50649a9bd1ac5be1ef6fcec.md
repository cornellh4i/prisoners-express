**"My Christmas Eve" by Colin VanBilliard**

On December 24th, everyone in the family would go to grandmaâ€™s house for presents and food. Everyone would bring Colin, who was like five years old, presents all over the place. In the living room, there used to be one little row grandma used to dress up with the Santa hat, sit in the middle of the living room, and pass out the presents. At 12:01 AM, the food was in the dining room and the kitchen: so many different foods, so much love in that one house on Christmas Eve. There were cookies, rum balls, pig blanket, cakes, and pies. It was so much fun, and these were the best holidays.
