**2 BROKE CHICKS by Fermin Fuentes**

La’vern: So, what now Miss Sherly?

Sh’early: What, what you mean?

La’vern: You want to stand there, posing for a selfie and you don’t even have a phone...you don’t even care.

Sh’early: Care, care about what?

La’vern: Broke, that’s what. We don’t even have a pot to piss in. But you wanna go and tap in our stash to buy an outfit that don’t fit, get your hair done, and cop a loosie!

Sh’early: But I like the 80’s Vern, plus I got a steal at the thrift shop, clearance rack!

La’vern: Yeah well, hope you kept the receipt, Cindy Crawford, cause we need that money for Sqiggy the Science guy, to buil-

Sh’early: Hold that thought and let me think about where I put it while I finish up my square…

La’vern: Oh, you wanna be a smartass! Well then you buil-

Sh’early: Look girl, the 80’s is cheaper, females look like we do, no breast and flat asses, there are more men to choose from, ‘cause you know, like, I know that 80% of men in 2036 are in prison, gas is 98 cents a gallon, and cancer sticks are only $1.50 a pack, plus Reagen is kinda hot.

La’vern: Bitch, you better go sell your flat ass then and make that stash money back to Sqiggy can get us home..

Sh’early: Bitch, you must be on drugs if you think Sqiggy can build us a time machine with $7..

La’vern: Sh’earl we had $10.50, what happen with the other $3.50?

Sh’early: Let me think! Asshole, 3.50-7.00-10.50, are you serious, we need to rob a bank so Sqiggy can have enough money to build that crap..and you whining about some chump change?

La’vern: ???

Sh’early: Hello!!? Did you hear me?

La’vern: ???

Sh’early: Uggg, you got my panties all bunched up, I need another loosie...Damn it?

La’vern: I got it Sh’earl, I got it!?

Sh’early: 15 cents?

La’vern: No stupid, you said earlier that Reagan is hot. Well, I was thinking, since we’re in DC why don’t we use the 3.50 to catch the metro to go to the White House and maybe you can seduce Mr. President out of enough money so we can get a time machine built.

Sh’early: Umm, that sounds like a plan, but I spent the rest on a can of “Right On!” deodorant spray. But the good news is that Pennsylvania Av. is only 10 blocks away...

La’vern: That’s the reason we’re broke now and in the future! Don’t you know how to save shit.. so hurry your broke, tight-thrift-clothes, twisted-hair-do-wearing, Ronald-Reagan-liking, cancer-stick-smoking ass up and let’s get to the White House..

Sh’early: Fuck you bitch!

La’vern: You already did, and it was good (CTFU)!

Sh’early: Uggg! What ever…

La’vern: (Still LOL) come on Sh’earl put it in gear. The 80’s is so ten minutes ago, I wanna get back home. I miss my cat, plus I want to do some scissoring on our air bed.

Sh’early: I forgot to tell you something Vern…

La’vern: Now what!?

Sh’early: Ummm well, I met this guy in the metro thrift store…….??

La’vern: And!!

Sh’early: He asked if I wanted to make a few bucks. I said, doing what? He said “follow me”...we went to this back room, full of clothes in boxes. He dropped his jeans and told me to get to work. “Fuck you,” I said. He said “Damn, no foreplay?” I said, “I mean no kind of sex, period! I’m not a whore! Look, Dr. Strange, I’m outta here.” He pulled up his Levi’s, grabbed my arm, and said “Ok, ok, I’m sorry, let’s start over? Look, I own this place, my name is Trump, Donald Trump… Women don’t like me, so I try to buy sex, or give them cheap clothes for sex. My junk is so small, well, you’ve seen it.” “So what does that got to do with me,” I told him. “You looked like you were lost and in need of something” he said. I told him, “Yeah, well, I do need something, a lot of cash to get a time machine built so that my girl and I can get back to the future.” He gave me a crazy look and said, “The future? I knew there was something different about you. I’m also from the future. Look forget about that time gizmo-thing, I have these pills with numbers from zero to whatever year you need that can take you to past, present, or future.” “For free?” I said. “Well, of course not, ain’t nothing for free,” he said. “I have to work for it huh?” I said. ”Yup, you know it,” he said. Well I got to work Vern. He gave me 2 pills, one had 2017 on it the other was 2036.

La’vern: Let me see, stupid!?

Sh’early: Here, look!

La’vern: Woah, they look like futuristic… but they’re different years!? 19 years apart!!

Sh’early: The catch is that he wants me to be his secretary of state if he gets voted to be president for 2017, and work for him.

La’vern: But you already put in your work at that 5 and dime!?

Sh’early: Well, since you don’t want to stay here in the 80’s, I can't meet Raegen. So why not go back to 2017? At least if Trump gets to be president, I can have sex with him… plus I’m tired of scissoring.

La’vern: Whatever, bitch, give me my pill. I’m out. I’m going back to the newports that cost 25.00 a pack, gas that’s 9.61 a gallon, my cat, and scissoring. At least I can get some decent clothes. Na’nu Na’nu.

Sh’early: Peace Vern, may the force be with you.
