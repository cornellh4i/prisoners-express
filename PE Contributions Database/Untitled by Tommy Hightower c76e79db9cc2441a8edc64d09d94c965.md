This mountain peak reminds me of my life in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. It was 1980-81, and my wife Amy and newborn first child David left Sacramento, California for a better life for our first born. As newlyweds, it was not difficult to leave and start fresh because we had so little to move. We literally packed our whole life into a station wagon and started anew.

I got a job on a workover rig in Grand Junction, Colorado. This was the rig that came in after the well was drilled and initial casing put in the well. The work over a finished rig came in and placed the final pipes and valves in. It got the oil flowing smoothly then capped off the well. After that, another crew that worked directly for the oil company who purchased the well would come in. Most of the oil exploration is done by independent contractors. They would locate possible sites with the geologists. Then an initial drilling would occur. Once a hole was drilled and actual oil located, it does not go shooting forth out of the ground at all. It is unusual for an oil well to have such pressure. Most must have a pump installed to suck the oil out of a deep well. My job was between exploration drilling and the final pump installation.

What a job to have. Some f the most beautiful scenery on earth has the most natural resources. So it’s our job to preserve the natural environment by installing wells and piping in a conscientious manner. There were several major oil companies in this area of the Rockies. You could see Shell logos next to Texaco and Chevron. Their pipes were perfect lines through the natural beauty, all flowing to a central terminal, sometimes hundreds of miles away.

Once our jobs are done, we made sure not one piece of litter was left behind. Contrary to rumors, oil workers are also environmentalists.

People today forget about all the people who works hard not to pollute God’s natural beauty. We cooperate with nature as long as extreme environmentalists respect our need to work to support our families. The world today needs energy. We also need to preserve natural balance. We do this through compromise and cooperation, not through the extreme polarization currently en vogue. Please remember that there are those will do harm for the promotion of their own view.

Let us see the world today through the lens of others, not just our own view of life. Amen, God bless!
