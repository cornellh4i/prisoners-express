**“Kids with Chains” by Cesar Hernandez**

No phenomenon in this world is not an illusory appearance projected by the mind. Unfortunately, most beings believe all phenomena are real and cling wrongly to their existence, thus inviting endless suffering.

How can this be so? The power of the mind is inconceivable; it can make any possible thing impossible and any impossible thing possible. We have trained our minds for such a long time in the belief that phenomena are real that the belief in this reality is second nature.

Anything in the world can be achieved through training. Think about dancers: In the beginning they can’t perform any movements, but through gradual training, they can dance wonderfully.

Therefore, whether it’s real or unreal, through long-term training, that thought will arise without effort when the power of familiarization is perfected.

There are countless examples to support this. In one medical school, a professor gave every student in his class a pill and told them that it would increase their blood pressure. Not long after they took the pill, their blood pressure was examined, and It had indeed increased. Yet the pill was actually candy.

In another case a patient went to see his doctor because he had a cold. He had an x-ray and was diagnosed with lung cancer. After hearing the news, his condition worsened to the point where he could barely get out of bed. A week later, the hospital called him and apologized for their mistake. They told him that after reexamining the x-ray, they had found that he only had an infection and didn’t have lung cancer. He felt better right away!

So you can see that the power of the mind is immense. Everything is only the work of the mind.
