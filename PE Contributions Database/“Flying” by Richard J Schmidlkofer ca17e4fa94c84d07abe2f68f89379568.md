**“Flying” by Richard J Schmidlkofer** 

My first flight had to be at the age of 6 or 7 years old at the amusement park. I was excited to go on an airplane ride even though it was only about 5 feet off the ground and going in a circle. I felt I was a pilot flying as a child. We have a big imagination. Even though it was not considered flying but to a child it is.

At the age around 12 years old in Appleton WI, at a car dealer they had a hot air balloon ride. My dad and I went on it. I had butterflies in my stomach. I’m not thrilled in high places. It was about 40 or 50 feet high. It was high enough for me being up in the air.

At the age of 16 at Wisconsin Dells, my family went too. My mother stayed on the ground, she was smart, but of course me and my dad went on a helicopter ride. My dad asked me if I wanted the window seat with a window or door. I do not remember what I said, but I could have said No! I sat in the middle of it. Of course I had butterflies in my stomach again. It was cool and adventurous seeing Wisconsin Dells from the sky.

My last flying experiment was in Oshkosh at EAA. We are famous for the biggest Airshow in the world, even different countries have come, and also famous people. Sally Rider (Space shuttle first female-pilot), Harris Ford (Indiana Jones/Star Wars), Mark Taylor (actor name on Home improvement, youngest child on show), Robert Kennedy, Vovaser Pilots and the New York Pilot that crash in Hudson River.

When I was 23 years old in 1995, I went on the Ford-T Airplane (I think that’s the name of it) and it had 4 blades, 2 on each wing. It was grayish-blue.

We took off on grass. Of course I had butterflies again. It was fun to see Oshkosh in the air seeing Lake Winnebago even though it is not a big lake in Wisconsin.

These are my flying experiences would I fly again, yes I would. I considered a dream of mine to get my pilot license and own my own plane, but it is only a dream. I considered flying; letting go and you are free.
