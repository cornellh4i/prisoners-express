**Blink of an Eye By Short Story Jones**

Going through life at 100 miles an hour, thinking you are untouchable, even invincible...but in the blink of an eye you find yourself sitting in the back seat of a police cruiser with no leg room, wondering what the heck did I do?

They take you to the station, fingerprint and photograph you, then throw you in a holding cell that smells of urine and feces...and guess what? You are expected to sleep in that cell.

You get to call friends and loved ones to arrange bail, only you find out when you screw up you have no friends or loved ones.

When you are up,everyone knows you, when you are down you are alone, all this happens in the blink of an eye.
