**“Baby Driver” by John Naylor**

It was at least the third time I’d watched *Baby Driver* with the guys at Pendleton in Indiana’s maximum security prison. Some laughs this time around. “That crazy girl would be you and Debbie” one proclaims. She’s way hot. Thankfully I’m a little younger than *Mad Men’s* Dan Driver character on AMC. Though if I’m pulling a hot girlfriend at that age who’s badass I’ll be happy. Still I imagine a girl nurturing my good side, like the waitress Deborah in the movie. Who knows, maybe it really is me. I always wanted a family. Maybe I’m too crazy for a traditional family. I recognize it’s me. Still I imagine a nice girl who accepts me one day. Not because I’m less than as some assume. But because I’m so much more and so many can’t handle that. Surely my end is better than the sentence Baby Driver got. The authorities promise me the stars. I’m so necessary. They have to fulfill their end. Stone stupid at times; like they just don’t get it. Though I know one day I’ll spend some time with the women who appreciate me. And that’s fulfillment of a long awaited pay day.

I am now awaiting a poorly anticipated court date. A writ of cert. If I had my money I’d hire a lawyer and be out of here by now. Problem is that I don’t always have what I need. Waiting on the other foot to drop. Almost a year now. Playin’ me as we don’t seal the deal on so many “touchdowns.” I can’t believe the song and dance is still dragging on. Ever since June of 2004. The beat goes on man. Maybe not so 20’s. But Captain America ain’t got nothin’ on me.
