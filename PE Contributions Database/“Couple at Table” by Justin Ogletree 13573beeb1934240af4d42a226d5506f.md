**“Couple at Table” by Justin Ogletree**

In the old days that would just be a couple at a dance, only a woman and a man. But in 2019 it’s a single jam, a photo of glam. What experiences are they having? Probably would be another advance to dance. Boom bam bodyslam pick up the flip woo she dance was the suggestion of the man who held a cigarette in his mouth.

These folks are someone who are only enjoying the show, with no interruptions by rude mugs or shoulder shrugs just another top dance pug… The gentleman in the hat looks like he wishes to take off his hat and show good manners at his best, but if he takes off his hat his eyes will lose track of the beauty at his left. All the while she only debates inside her mind if the guy on stage might catch her gazing. Let's admit these two are overnight spending trying to buy time to experience. She looks dressed for Hawaii and he looks as if suited for a funeral but the expense of the outing is suspensible, one track minded on a two-streak. Did anyone say fiesta day? I didn’t expect the two to miss it...
