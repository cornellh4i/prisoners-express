**Mindfulness by Jason R. Gluscock**

Prison beats the mind, body, and soul. IT hammers on me like a blacksmith, not with an artist’s eye for his craft, but to destroy and ruin. Glowing bits of my being fly in cascading arcs with each strike. I am made less and less and less.

The being of self is not quite like iron, fortunately. I have a choice. I choose how to respond to assaults done to me. So, I choose not to allow myself to be destroyed and reduced by these traumas, but to grow and find new ways to be flexible. I choose to be resilient.

This process is mostly about being mindful of who I am, what I want to become, and envisioning my beingness evolving into that vision. I must remind myself that I am not the source of external attacks, that these attacks are toward their fears, and I am the mirror of the evils they see in themselves, so it’s they, themselves, that they are targeting and not I. I am not the disease but the cure.

This mindfulness instills, empowers, and manifests as a solid self confidence built on truth and understanding. The beatings diminish both in frequency and intensity. I become more in control of my fears and they are found to be shadows or illusions. I have more options from which to choose. These are the essence of resilience.
