**“In the Blink of an Eye (A Twisted Childhood Story)” by Manuel Aleman**

Los Angeles 1984:

Chuhol and I were playing Mario Brothers on his Atari 2600 when my mom pulled up to Chuhol’s driveway and honked the horn. My sister was riding shotgun. Up to that point, they had never picked me up at Chuhol’s. Something was wrong.

*“Come on, Manuel, get in. I’m taking you to go meet your uncle,”* mom said with a grin.

If I would’ve known where she was really taking me, I would’ve ran back to Chuhol’s house, locked the door, ran out the backdoor, hopped a few fences, and found a good hiding place until my dad came home. But my mom and sister didn’t hint at their true intentions.

Mom drove us back to a shady neighborhood, hit the back allies, and parked behind a bar. She honked the horn and a strange man that looked like a Mexican Yosemite Sam came out holding a small bag and an accordian. Tucked into his waistband was a 38, 6 shooter, revolver.

*“Wow, our tio looks like a badass,,”* I said to my sister, Gloria.

*That ain’t our tio,”* Gloria said as the man leaned into the driver side window and tongue kissed our mom. *“That’s your new dad.”*

Oh, hell no! My real dad was better than Batman and Superman put together, why would I need a new one? Whatever the case, I shook off the shocking expression on my face and got with the program real quick.

My new dad, Alias, slid into the driver’s seat and quickly introduced himself.

*“Mom, what’s going on? Where did this man come from? Where are you really taking me? What happened to my real dad?”* I was demanding answers.

*“I’ll explain it all when we get back to your uncle’s.”* mom kept saying while she made goo goo eyes at her new camote. They couldn’t keep their hands off of each other.

Maybe if they’d focused on the road, mom and her new man would’ve reached our destination sooner. But all that ‘hanky-panky’ kept getting us derailed and lost. At every gas station, they’d ask the attendant for directions. It turns out that my uncle lived very far away; Amarillo, Texas to be exact. (Many years later, while I was on a prison bus to Oklahoma, I learned that a trip from Northern California to Amarillo, Texas, took 20 hours.) It took my mom and Alias 3 days to reach our destination.

Exhausted upon arrival, my mom parked her car outside of a farm and honked the horn. The first thing I remember was how foul the farm smelled. The place reeked of cow manure, and the pigpen on the side of his property wasn’t helping anything.

Tio, Chuey, greeted us on his front lawn and introduced us to his wife and family. He had 2 boys my age, a little girl, and twin baby girls. Then, he took his 22 rifle out to the pigpen and shot one right between the eyes. He gutted it in front of us and made chicharones for dinner.

Right away, we moved into a house a few blocks away and mom enrolled us in school. *“I hope you know we spank the kids here when they get outta line.”* the principal said to my mother. *“Do you have a problem with that?”*

*“No problem,”* my mom said, *“Dale duro.”* This was a nightmare.

My sister became an instant celebrity while all the kids in my class, including my teacher, hated me. They said I talked funny and called me a dirty hippie.

Alias was never home at that time, he found a job and they were working him like a dog. We didn’t miss him one bit.

We were scheduled to spend the rest of our lives in Amarillo until I got really sick. The doctor didn't think I was going to make it. Mom didn’t want me dying in Texas, so one day while Alias was at work, my mom decided to jump ship and abandoned Alias. Karma’s a bitch. Quickly, mom packed up our meager belongings and hit the road, Jack.

On the trip back home, I was dying on the back seat while my sister nursed me to no avail, but as soon as we crossed the ‘Welcome to California’ sign, I started feeling better. And in the blink of an eye, I was cured, back in LA; living with my old dad and my new mom. But that’s another story.

THE END.
