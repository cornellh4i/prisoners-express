**“Judgement” by Carl Nunnery**

I saw this picture of two individuals who had chains on their arms and legs. They were pictured standing in front of a wall which had bars in this wall. This picture reminded me of a scripture in (Iam 3:7) which reads, “he has walled me about so that I cannot escape, he has put heavy chains on me.”

Chains were used as restraints against those who had been accused of crimes, in other words, as a form of judgement against them. When you do wrong, it doesn’t matter if you are: “Young or old, “rich or poor...strong or weak.”

All those who break the laws are subject to this judgement. In (Deut 1:17) it clearly tells us, “you shall not be partial in judgement, but you shall hear the small as well as the great.” This means no one is above being punished for doing wrong!

In (Eccl 11:9) it says, “know that for all things, God will bring you into judgement.” To avoid this judgement, God requires 3 things from us, we are to be:	* TRUE to his “word”

* Obedient to his “law”

* Faithful to “Him.”

When we follow these 3 requirements we not only avoid judgement for the wrong we have done, but God rewards us for our life of faithfulness to him that he gives us (2) special gifts in return:

- To enjoy a life-time with Him who created us - - - (God)
- To spend a lifetime in eternity with Him who saved us - - - (Jesus).

Don’t take the wrong path that will lead you into darkness, don’t be chained in darkness waiting for your own judgement, let God pull you out of darkness! In (Psalms 107:10) it says, “some sat in darkness and in gloom. Prisoners in misery and in IRONS.”

This does not have to be you! Let God remove the chains that bind you, the chains that are keeping you from coming to him, God will set you free!!

“If the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.” (John 8:36)
