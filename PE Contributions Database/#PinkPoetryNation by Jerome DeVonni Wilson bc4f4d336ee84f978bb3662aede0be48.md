**“#PinkPoetryNation” by Jerome DeVonni Wilson**

As a wrongfully convicted prisoner in the wrongful conviction capital of the world--Texas, my struggle is encumbered by the fact that I not only have to fight for freedom, but also have to fight for my right to fight for freedom.

So I mentally employed the new concept: To Better One’s Self as to Better One’s Struggle. Thus, I decided to help others in order to apply this concept. Since my grandmother was a breast cancer survivor, I would advocate for that movement.

We put together a book entitled, “Pink Poetry: A Literary Crusade for Breast Cancer Awareness.” Being published from the belly of the beast is a tedious task, to do it independently is quite a feat...yet it was done.

However, this parallel universe is designed to keep us 100% dependent upon our captors. The application of knowledge and skill is forbidden unless it’s solely for the purpose of contributing to the furtherance of mass incarceration.

Therefore, with respect to having books published that I penned, I’ve received 3 disciplinary cases, been targeted, oppressed, and censored for having the audacity to debunk the stigmatism attached to being an incarcerated black man by doing something positive.

They’ve attempted to convert me to a meek, docile, subjugated slave with no voice. But this shouldn’t shock the conscious. These are the same ones who will forced a man to labor under involuntary servitude yet not contribute any of the proceeds to his child support debt or education fund for said prisoner’s child.

Kaepernick and others are being slighted for their silent protests...here in this parallel universe, one’s silent protest is a quiet hymn that will forever be sung from the grave…

If I had to be brutally honest with myself, I’d probably acknowledge that I’m growing weary. Tiresome. Exhausted. But those are unwelcomed weaknesses that only distract my existence. If I wasn’t an invisible man with a hoarse throat--who only speaks in whispers because no one is listening--I could expound on how I am the matter that I am composed of.

But I’m neither real with myself nor tangible to others, so my pleas are but ghost-writings; incessant weeping to deaf ears. My irrelevance is in vogue. I know this because everyone is into it. No, seriously! My disregard is the latest craze with lawyers, publications, advocates for social justice, and sadly enough--relatives.

SMH. Are we not the same? Temples of flesh and bone endowed with hope and compassion adorned with immaculate flaws? Someplace, our bridge to nowhere has to meet, and people out here have to grasp that when people in here try to uplift ourselves, they’re helping us by validating our value, also helps society.

If we lose sight of all that is not this, all we see is the misery of those becoming criminally insane. What’s to stop us from becoming it? Without righteous intervention, when the doors open for the prisoner, that miserable insanity seeps out into the free world like raw sewage from an eroded pipeline. Waste.

Rather than resent-filled recidivists returning to our women, children and seniors...what if when we reached out, we were acknowledged? Seen? Heard? Our pain and desire to rise from the ashes palpable enough to resonate with the common folk.

And while I’m feeding on dream-filled “what if’s,” what if the cretins of the prison industrial complex removed the shackles from our feet, the bells from around our necks, and most importantly, lifted the prohibition from our will to aspire and achieve?

As James Allen stated “a man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it,” because if not, “aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.” Is this what they want for us? Me?

I don’t want to be the filthy topic of a discussion held in some criminal justice course class where they weigh my words and discard me when the bell rings. No. Be a bridge...link to me [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XGBFWST](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XGBFWST) and together we can set off a chain of events that will evolve the worldview of the incarcerated for the better.

May they not defeat the hopes and aspirations of Pink Poetry Nation or oppress the civil or human rights of the hopeful and aspirational. Experience the book and share the empowerment!
