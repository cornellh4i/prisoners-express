***Predetermined Destination* by James Smith**

It was a cold, wet, and windy evening on January 10, although I can only barely recall it. The memories of it are vague, illusory, and old phantoms of mind. Why did she come here? Having arrived by taxi, she summoned perhaps only moments before. From being shoved in hurried fashion the door suddenly swong open, Thud! Then Splash! Face first, she fell into a gurgling gutter of swirling debris and flotsam of all kinds. Precariously close and only inches from her face floated an old photo of a negative image, smeared with mud of an old and wizened man, a portrait of grandpa? Long since deceased, perhaps. But, how did it come to be here? And, why in negative form? Next, and quite suddenly came a blast of wind and rain, a squall that splattered her face and the old photo drying it briefly under and away. It bobbed immediately--back to the surface and as if attached to a sail it scurried away to an unknown and predetermined destination. Scrambling, first, up on the knees, to her hands, then to her feet to chase after her umbrella that had been taken by the wind and blown away at the time she had fell. As she stumbled forward coming near to it, it, too, was caught by a gust of seemingly ethereal force and propelled on its edge spinning and catapulting over its handle briefly caught in a crevice at a corner of the main boulevard of this small town. Steadily gaining speed as if in desperate flight from pursuit the speeding and mysterious old photo vanished from view. In what must have been a sudden impulse, a flash of perception, intuition, or epiphany of her mind, the thoughts must have formed: am I being summoned to follow these things directed by a divine hand? At what destination the things and knowledge shall I find? And, without option nor further thought, boldly and without hesitation, she lithely leapt toward her future heedless of those now moving quickly to clear her path.
