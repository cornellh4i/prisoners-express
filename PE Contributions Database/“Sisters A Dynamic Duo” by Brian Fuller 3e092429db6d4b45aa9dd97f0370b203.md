**“Sisters: A Dynamic Duo” by Brian Fuller**

There’s a bond between sisters that’s completely indescribable. If I had to explain it, you wouldn’t understand. Although we’ve had our share of disagreements, our love and dedication to one another always brought us back to center. Pick a fight with one of us; then, you’re just as likely to be fighting the both of us.

As far back as I can remember, we’ve had this competitive streak. We always loved playing outside. Running, climbing trees, playing hide and seek with the other kids; we were always just a little bit faster than everybody else. Strength and athleticism come naturally to me. Even some of the boys had a hard time keeping up with us.

All that pent up energy often led to mischief. I can’t remember who exactly took the picture, but it was Halloween night. All the trick-or-treating was done. We stashed our costumes and candy so they wouldn’t slow us down. We’d stop and laugh hysterically while trying to catch our breaths.

We loved swimming, softball, volleyball, and basketball. But our true passion was tennis. Needless to say, back in those early days, there weren’t a lot of black girls like me playing tennis. That did not deter us one bit. We were good! In fact, we were almost too good. Some of the other girls would even refuse to play with us. More often than not, my sister, Venus and I would end up playing each other. People would gather to watch us, but I still couldn’t understand what the big deal was. I vividly remember falling down this one time. I scratched my knee really hard, but I just couldn’t let them see me cry. It made me so mad! My coach came out and said, “Serena baby… you just channel all that anger into your next serve!”

And through all those pulled muscles, blisters, scrapes, bruises - you name it - we just kept at it. UNH! AHH! UGH! Ball after ball, volley after volley. We simply tried to make each match better than the last. We learned to “shake them haters off!” We also learned that being true to yourself would bring the recognition, respect, and success we deserved.

Oh sure… my sister and I are still fiercely competitive. Every now and then, she’ll even beat me. It makes her mad when I say I let her win. Then, we’ll laugh like crazy and give each other a big hug just like we used to do when we were little.

Life is good now. Unfortunately, we’re always going to have to deal with the haters. “They” say I’m past my prime, and some days, I’ll admit - it takes a little longer to work the soreness out. However, I still know how to channel all that negativity into something positive. And, I’ve still got myself one wicked serve! Go ahead. Try me.
