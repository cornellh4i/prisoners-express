**“How Could I Forget?” by David Irons**

I came out of the trenches with my best friend draped over me like hunting prey. A photographer popped out of the brush, snapping a photo of me. A shot fired. A sniper took him out with a single shot to the back of the head. I had never seen a man so willing to give his life for a photo op.

I collected his camera and headed back to base. The closer I got, the more my curiosity about the photographer grew. At camp’s outer edge, I dropped off my friend at the coroner’s tent then proceeded to Sgt. Demery’s. When I arrived, he was relaxed, sipping coffee, puffing a cigarette, and admiring his chiseled, lightly-complected face in a mirror. “Do you have a minute, sir?” I asked.

I gave him a rundown on what happened with the photographer. To my surprise, he gave me an address and granted me a week’s leave. I went back to my tent, packed up my essentials, and caught the next transport to Rammstein. Going state side for answers seemed a long shot, but in a strange way, Sarge had a way of tracking people down.

After more than 8 hours flight time, a brief train ride, and a short stroll, I arrived at the doorsteps of 43 Dunham Avenue. It was in a small town just south of Lakewood, New Jersey. The house was white 2x4 wooden panels forming the two upper levels, set up on a concrete foundation finishing out a lower level.

The house was well-kept with a neatly trimmed lawn and a flower garden bordering the walkway. The yard wasn’t fenced in, yet the garden was bordered by arious sizes and shapes of rocks. I felt the need to take in the sight as it was calm and soothing compared to what I left behind. With my duffle bag in hand and camera strapped around my neck, I raised my left hand and knocked at the door. “Hang on! I’ll be right there!” I heard a woman’s voice call out. It sounded distant.

After a few minutes I was greeted by an elderly woman, mid-sixties maybe, wearing a turquoise and white flower print shirt and black slacks. Her hair was up in curlers, and her face was nicely tanned. Before I could say a word to her, she spotted the camera around my neck, the light in her eyes soon veiled by tears. “Come in,” she said, trying to keep from crying, “it looks like we have…” Her sentence trailed off as I followed her toward the kitchen near the back of the house.

I pulled out a chair for her, and she sank slowly into it, folding her arms and burying her face to let out her painful cries. I sat down my duffle bag, placed the camera on the table, and took a seat. Unsure of how to comfort her, I waited for her reprieve for us to talk.

A short time later, she gathered her composure enough to talk. She pulled a Kleenex from a shelf above the table, dabbed her eyes, blew her nose, and pointed at the camera and asked, “Where did you get that?”

I gave her the story on how I came across the camera with its owner, and she lost it. It seemed quite a while before she regained her composure. The pain in her eyes was deep. I said, “I can see this is hard for you. Should I come back another time?”

“No.” She said,” I needed to hear this, and now you need to hear my side of the story.” I could tell we would be there a while because this time, she took the box of Kleenex from the shelf and began telling me of her son Daryl, the photographer.

It turns out his passion was to immortalize those who may not get to tell their story. He wanted to show the world a day in the life of a soldier, whether man or woman, and the challenges walking through that day. It didn’t matter who the subject of his photo would be; all that mattered is that he caught a moment of their story. It was hard for me to contain myself after hearing that, but I’m glad I did. Now his story remains.
