**Close Call by E.J. Jernigan**

Allow me for a moment to take you back in time of Christmas Eve, 2006 to visit one of my many close calls. What type of call, you ask? Either death of manslaughter. Possibly even a life long disability including, but not limited to, paralysis.

Throughout the year, things were often dull around the Jernigan household. Not always, but usually. The holiday however was all but. Especially on Christmas Eve and in 2006 the place was rocking.

The voices of Sammy Kershaw, Alan Jackson, and Alabama filled the 70 fast single wide trailer from end to end. Every grown adult in attendance was partying it up, indulging in ludicrous amounts of alcohol. There were clouds of cigarette smoke thick enough to be butchered. The adults weren’t the only ones turning up though.

At this particular event I had a few party guests of my own. A “P.Y.T.” from down the street and two of her brothers. With all the commotion as well as hazy inebriation, the lot of us had free reign to do as our hearts desired. My guest of honor, the girl from down the street, didn’t participate in any of the adults’ activities however her brothers and I didn’t hold back.

As the night grew younger my guest’s curfew creeped up on us. Since I had been allotted so many privileges for beyond what a young person such as myself should have, I decided to test the waters a bit deeper. I approached my pop’s wife (the only mother I ever knew) with the dilemma of this curfew. Mind you, each and every license wielding individual present was currently seven sheets to the wind. Another dilemma. But of course, I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t have a solution.

“Momma, let me get the keys. We gotta take Amber and them home thirty minutes ago.”

Of course, she was extremely reluctant to do so. There wasn’t enough vodka in the world to shroud her judgement on a matter such as this. No way in America was she going to place truth of this sort solely in me. Since we are starting to become familiar, you know that I had a solution for that too.

“Ma, Bryan (a family friend) said he would ride along to ensure that everything goes accordingly.” I highly doubt that I said “accordingly”, but you get what I’m getting at. Although skeptical skill, this did the trick and she gave in. Out the door I went, keys jingling in hand.

The part about Brya agreeing to accompany us was factual and the four of us sat in the car for several minutes waiting on him to join us. All the way until I grew tired of waiting on him. Back then I hadn’t yet learned the virtue of patience. Plus I was anxious to wheel the car. I pulled off without him.

It was a short drive to their place, only a couple hundred feet of main road between the two trailer parks. While dropping them off the older brother, Brandon, wanted to come back with me and stay the night. I said cool.

The two of us began the short trip back. I had a left hand cigarette rolled up and put fire to it. A few puffs later I passed it to Brandon. I pulled into my trailer park. Turned the radio all the way up. Slammed the accelerator to the floor. Get it up to about 50-55 mph before catching a glimpse of oncoming headlights. I jerked the wheel to the left. Sudden impact. Brandon’s head thrashed the windshield. Both of us entered a consciousness of eternal silence and darkness.

Several moments later I came back to. Brandon didn’t. Blood was everywhere. Oh boy. You know you messed up, right? I yelled his name and shook a single shoulder violently. No response. Oh boy. Yep, definitely messed up. I opened my door and stepped out. The pressure on my right foot sent an inexorable pain up the length of my leg. I ignored it. Adrenaline’s credit due. I dragged Brandon out of the car. Eventually, he came to. My fear dissolved. He wasn’t dead. Thank goodness! You still messed up though. I looked at the car. The entire front end was smashed. The transmission was sitting in the cab. Oh boy. Flashing lights were everywhere. Every intoxicated mind instantly sobered up.

The Jernigan’s Christmas Eve party was moved to the emergency room at Duke University Hospital. In the end all became well but oh boy, what a close call.
