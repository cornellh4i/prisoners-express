**“Ignorance is Winning” by Robert J. Richter**

Do you want to win, really win, or pretend that you are winning? If you want to win, then you need to know the rules of the game. The most fundamental game is no human invention; it is of the universe itself. Learn how it works, and the rest is easy. So why aren’t you learning?

Ignorance is winning this battle on the earth. A few brave souls are fighting for truth, but there is no way to win against ignorance. The majority of people simply don’t care about facts or logic and would rather watch *Jerry Springer* or *Jersey Shore* than read a science book. I can’t reach those people. There’s nobody there.

Scientists are no better. Every physicist on earth knows that wires contain both electrons and protons, yet modern physics is based on the idea that electricity is a fluid that flows through neutral wires. People believed in magnetic fields long before the electron was discovered. Each year, someone wins the nobel prize for physics for work that is based on a mistake. Can I win? Apparently not.

You aren’t even trying to win, you, the person reading this. You have been indoctrinated into a religion and so thoroughly brainwashed that you can’t even begin to think for yourself. I have spent six years trying to find a single rational human being. I have failed. Not one person has proved to be capable of looking at facts and using logic--not one.

So keep playing your social monkey games and worrying about which famous person is dating who. You can’t win; you aren’t trying. The truth about how the universe works has been published online, and yet earth ignores it. Human beings are not rational. You better pray that aliens never show up because you won’t stand a chance. The only thing humans can win is social recognition from other humans.

If there is a single sane being on this planet, I’d like to know. Am I the only person capable of looking at the facts and admitting that he was wrong? I won the race to discover/develop the theory of everything, but I can’t win against pure ignorance. The “physics” of Higgs and Hawking is a religion, not a science. There are no black holes. Dark matter is a fantasy. Higgs bosons are not real.

I haven’t won yet, but I won’t quit. Maybe, just maybe, there is another rational being on the earth. Perhaps some alien observer is here, searching, for signs of true intelligence. Hello! I’m right here! Maybe I’ll win a free trip to another planet, one where I’m not surrounded by superstitious morons. I’m not holding my breath.
