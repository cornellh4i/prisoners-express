**"Good Jr. High" by Dominguez George**

Well school wasn’t my thing- I mean when it came to bringing homework to school- I always thought that school work was supposed to be in school.

I remember when I was in junior high. We had a place every morning where we’d hang out smoking cigarettes. At times we would smoke a joint or two before going into school.

I did like reading but not reading to the whole class. One day the teacher called me to his desk and saw that my eyes were red. He asked me why my eyes were so red and I told him that I was in the hospital with a friend all night cause he had gotten into an accident so I was there till 3:40 in the morning, then I got home around four something, got up at 6:30, took a shower and grabbed my books. I was falling asleep in homeroom and first period and he told me to go put cold water on my face.

I’m like the guy in the end but without glasses. But like I said I wasn’t really into school. I just liked it because of my girlfriend. I liked hanging with my buddies and I began hating all my classes like Math and English because it was getting really hard for me. But when I started night school, I began to really hate it all. Reading was ok but when I took the test the teacher told me I didn’t pass it. I wanted to retake it but she told me I needed to pay again. I then told her do you think I’m stupid? But I’m not that stupid- “forget you and the Geo.” I walked out. But I did get my Geo but I’m here in prison because believe me you’ll have lots of time to think and read.
