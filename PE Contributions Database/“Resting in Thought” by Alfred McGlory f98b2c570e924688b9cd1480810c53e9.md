**“Resting in Thought” by Alfred McGlory**

I wonder what she’s thinking about. She probably thinks she has me fooled. I know I’m not the real father. I know, I just haven’t said a word about it for the sake of Carly. Besides, her loving is so good. Maybe I am a sucker, I mean I went and bought this $23 million house. We’re just sitting here waiting for the furniture to arrive. Deep down, my heart still belongs to Phoebe. I should have given her more attention. She was by far the best woman I had in my life, and now she’s gone forever. Maybe I should give her a call. I wonder if she thinks about me. I’m raising a kid that isn’t mine, I’m incredibly unhappy, and all I have to show for it is an amazing sex life. I just really need to get away. I heard her grandmother has been fucking with that voodoo shit down there in New Orleans. She might have some of that shit on me. I’ve been fucked up ever since I got with her. She calls all the shots. Maybe, it’s because she has such a beautiful smile, and the most enchanting eyes that make me forget I need to get away. When I was with Phoebe, I could think and be myself, but now I have no control. It’s okay, cause I have a surprise. When she wakes up in the morning, I will be long gone. I’ve already arranged for a charter plane to fly me to Honduras. I’ll stay there a few weeks before leaving for Sydney. That night we made passionate love. I went to to the bathroom and canceled my flight.
