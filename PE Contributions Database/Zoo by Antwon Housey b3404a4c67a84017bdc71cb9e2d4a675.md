**Zoo by Antwon Housey**

As a child I wanted to be a veterinarian. I loved animals because of the mystery within not being able to communicate with them. The Zoo was my ideal place to visit, however I was never blessed with that opportunity. However at the age of 17 I found myself becoming an exhibit in the GDC Corporate Zoo! This zoo isn’t filled with animals, it’s filled with humans. Humans who have been reduced to third class citizens. The zoo itself is basically run by those humans without equal pay for their work. The zoo is maintained by the inhabitants, this zoo is more degrading than the actual zoo. At least after the zookeepers kidnapped the animals they made sure they cared for property. This zoo in which I live is breaking so many human rights and actually profiting from it. Zookeeping in 2017 is advanced human warehousing. The zoo turns the gorilla docile and passive, it takes all the fight and hope out of him. After so many years of incarceration the same results are seen within the Blackman. He stops fighting for his freedom, his human rights, and most importantly his sanit. The zoo leaves the gorilla dependent and vulnerable. He becomes content with his captivity. The Blackman allows the institution to keep him in an inferior state of mind. The gorilla is usually the main attraction at the zoo, just like the Blackman is usually more populated in prison. Then he is in the society. When compared and contrasted I would rather be the gorilla in the zoo, than the Blackman in GDC?!
