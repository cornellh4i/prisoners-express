**“Woman In Veil” by Derek Le Compte**

She’s dark and mysterious. That’s my Scorpio Queen so ravishing. See that intensity in her eyes that blazes through the veil? She’s asserting her Alpha Female status. You may try to figure out what she’s thinking… but you may not. She’s intoxicated in its purest form. Her addiction is more ensnaring than any drug. Her kisses come with cracks of a whip. You will comply with her order or be punished ….. Not like you are thinking! She’s wearing black, veiled like a widow, to mourn your former self because your soul belongs to her now. She feeds off your energy like a dark queen of all vampires.

Are you willing to submit and dance with the devil? If not, I’d not even venture bravely near her. Believe me, you’re not ready. If she’s a Black Widow, you’re finished either way. If you get trapped in her web, and struggle, she feasts on you because you just got stuck further. Similarly, if you don’t struggle, you’re still stuck and she eats you. Now, she could free you and give you all the sexual rapture you ever deserved. But, she’s a Black Widow, she still eats you! But at least you go out happy.
