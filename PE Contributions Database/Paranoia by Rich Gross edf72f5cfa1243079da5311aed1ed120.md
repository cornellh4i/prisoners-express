**"Paranoia" **by Rich Gross**

That’s me, red-eyed and baked, in the middle with my two new best friends. There’s Danbo: tall, brown hair, perpetually squinting and considered one of the coolest guys in my new school. The other guy is Pitstink. He describes himself as a red-headed stepchild and calls himself Pitstop. Everyone else calls him Pitstink, and if he lifts his arm, you’ll know why.

My new school is Gadsden Mountain Regional High School, commonly known as Mountain High. A good name for a school where marijuana is smoked in bathrooms, stairwells, broom closets, locker rooms, inside cars, and just about anywhere outside. The staff is clueless, and the students seem to be proud of their pot. “This ain’t no Columbine; we’re laid back up here” is often said. Usually right after they ask me where I’m from, I say York, PA. They excitedly say, “New York City?” and I respond: “No, York, Pennsylvania. It’s a small city in the south-central part of the state.” Their disappointment and boredom are palpable.

Let me backtrack and tell you how I suddenly left York a little more than a week ago. I came home from school to what I believed was a happy home. My parents had an announcement: “We recently turned 40, we are not happy, we’re getting separated, and we’re both leaving York.”

My mom wanted to use her nursing skills to combat ebola in Africa, while my dad wanted to move to the Rocky Mountains to “breathe some fresh air.” I expected Mom to come back when she broke a nail or something and Dad would have changed his mind by then. But no, Dad had us on a flight west in 36 hours, and within a week, Mom was sending me pics of her new life in a filthy, Liberian clinic full of dying people.

So I was taken away from my mother, my friends, my hometown, and dumped on a mountain. The only flat ground around here is the football field where the Mt. High Marmosats lose almost every game. The only similarity to my old school is Pizza Friday, but it is served by a chef whose name is Sal Minelli. His name sounds like Salmonella, and no one thinks that’s odd. They think it’s odd that I’ve never been on skis.

My new friends are not as funny as they think they are, but if I smoke enough pot, I can laugh at their nicknames for the teachers. Mr. Althaus is “Outhouse,” Mr. Farquar is “Fucker,” Mrs. Kruger is “Cougar” (she is one), and so on. When they told me about Coach Dikinball, I asked what his real name is. Turns out Dikinball is an actual surname. Oh, and then there’s Principal Strickler who is, of course, a stickler.

There is an exchange student with dark hair and dark eyes. They say her name is Ulik Mahbodi; that can’t be right. Pitstink can’t remember where she is from, but he’s pretty sure it’s “one of those countries that hate us.”

I would like to just walk up to her, introduce myself, and then ask what her name is. I don’t know if she speaks English or if I will be able to if and when I talk to her. I worry that she will think I like her...because I think I like her. I worry that our relationship will be torn asunder when our countries go to war and that our children won’t be accepted in either nation. Does smoking marijuana make you paranoid?

I don’t know how much fresh air my Dad is getting. We’re staying in a motel that rents rooms by the week until he finds work. Our room is only a few yards away from the road where trucks belch smoke as they struggle to pull the hill. I’m afraid he won’t find work. I’m afraid Mom will catch ebola. I’m afraid the roaches in our room will crawl in my mouth while I sleep. I think I got reasons to be paranoid.

I had a dream last night where I was watching the TV news, and they were saying that ebola has been eliminated in humans, but now roaches got it. Then they said that the country that the exchange student is from was bombing the USA, but they were only dropping giant peaches on us. Then they said that the police were arresting everybody who has pot in their backpack. Then I woke up and saw my dad sitting on the edge of his bed, in the dark, with his head in his hands, sobbing. Yeah, I’m really paranoid now.
