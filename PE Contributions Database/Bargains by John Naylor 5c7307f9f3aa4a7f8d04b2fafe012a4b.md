**Bargains by John Naylor**

There’s nothing like a good bargain. When my brother Andrew was an infant my dad Dennis would say to him over and over “Buy low, sell high.” We grew up like American Pickers on The History Channel. The act of a bargain, the find, and yes even negotiating was a hobby. We learned to be profitable at it. Some kids could get summer jobs. I guess the upside to what we did is that it was year-round and we enjoyed it. We weren’t as focused on antiques altogether. Just a cool bargain. It was a family activity so we often didn’t have to buy gas to do it. I’d call it bragging rights if you can flip your buy for multiple times what you paid. My brother is still at it. And i’ve been in jail and prison since 2004. My brother Andy Naylor is an Ebay seller and he went through college for a business management degree. He’s pretty active listing things and he has flawless customer service. So if you want to be treated right and look for a product without spending hundreds in gas, give his seller list a look. You may be surprised at what you find. It may make someone’s day.

The word “bargain” isn’t always fun though. Like “plea bargain.” If you’ve done only legal research or maybe if you haven’t, it may make you shudder. “They’re offering us...” Us, like you’re going in with me and staying on as counsel. My very own jailhouse lawyer until my release. No, they’re offering a plea on trumped up charges as always. If you’re fortunate and in the market for one it may be for just what you did and nothing you didn’t. A whole lot of them, probably most, aren’t. I recently read in some legal research that you should refrain from the word “bargain.” because it implies less than what you did. Like it’s underhanded. They suggested it be referred to as an “agreement.” Which means you’re agreeing to lose out on a lot of appeals. So you’d better nail your PCR-1 when you learn how you were deprived of your rights. I reckon they’re right. That’s not a bargain. Get acquainted with legal research, it’s not so scary. And it’s hopeful. That’s a bargain.
