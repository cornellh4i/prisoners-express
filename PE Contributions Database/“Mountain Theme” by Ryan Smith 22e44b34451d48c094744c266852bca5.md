**“Mountain Theme” by Ryan Smith**

There really is a land where the buffalo roam. One-third of the year the ground is covered with snow. The place I’m referencing is south-east Idaho. There’s a spot on the snake river that my dad calls home. It’s five or six miles on the other side of County Line Road.

The cold crisp air has a light feel on your lungs as you breathe. You’re grateful for the gravel road. Walking down the street in Idaho Falls is occasionally like walking down a slip-n-slide after having coated it with a thick layer of Armorall.

You are grateful for the burnin’ barrel. After lighting a barbecue you light the burnin’ barrel, and head back inside for another trash can. On your way inside, you take notice of the thermometer. It reads -- 18 degrees Fahrenheit. *Good thing it’s not windy!* “I’d be safe and warm, if I was in LA…” you can hear the song in your mind’s ear, but you have not one regret for moving out here.

After dumping more trash on the fire, you put some steak on the grill. You leave the lid up so you can feel the warmth on your face. With your hands buried in the pockets of your Carhartt, you are arm enough not to realize you’re wearing shorts.

You can smell the meat start to cook at the juices drip onto the burning mesquite chips. You can hear the fluid rumble as the river flows by, constant movement in the stillness. You see the patch of grass where the moose had a baby a few years back, and wonder where they are at.

The sound of water flowing is punctuated by raucous laughter. You peer through the giant window into the den, and see your family gathered between the fireplace and the Christmas tree. It makes you smile to know that they’re getting along.

Three taps on the window break my reverie.
