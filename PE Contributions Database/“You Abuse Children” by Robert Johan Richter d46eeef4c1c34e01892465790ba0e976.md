**“You Abuse Children” by Robert Johan Richter**

What a nice little girl! She enjoys tooting away, pretending to make music. It’s equally cute and annoying. What she needs is to understand how the Universe works, to learn the rules, but you won’t let her. Why do you hate her so? What did she ever do to you? Are you really that evil? I think so. You lie to children, deny them the truth, deny them any opportunity to learn how reality works. Why do you do this? They need truth!

It starts with little lies, Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, then it keeps on going. The truth never arrives. Do you know why there are so few female scientists? The fundamental science Is physics, and modern physics is a pile of bullshit. This cute little girl can never be a physicist, never learn the truth, because you just don’t care. Don’t pretend otherwise. Stop being an evil coward and just be honest evil. Once you admit that you don’t know, admit that you don’t want her to know either. You don’t want her to succeed, period.

It’s the worst form of envy: “I don’t know, so you don’t get to know.” I don’t have this problem. I share knowledge, tell the truth, and try to help people. I think that this little girl deserves the truth. Why don’t you?
