**Flying by Yankee Lawyer**

Flying is a wonderful way for a bird to travel. For human beings, it’s vastly overrated.

It’s an important military tactic. Spies flew over enemy lines in WWI. Our air superiority was clearly a decisive factor in WWII. We have since used aircraft to strafe possessions of “terrorists” and to drop napalm, poison, and bombs on rice paddies, villages, schools, and hospitals. We have precision bombs that can be guided down a chimney of an oil refinery or a convent.

Flying as a means of killing and destruction is safe and effective, but now we have drones. Using “virtual flying” technology, a man can kill an enemy farmer thousands of miles away without leaving his bedroom.

We have used planes and satellites to destabilize much of Central and South America. Displaced people become refugees fleeing to somewhere else. They have to travel on foot. The USA, we round them up. We put the grown ups on planes and fly them back to be killed. We keep some of their children. Human trafficing, including slavery, is big business in the USA.

I am currently abiding in a no-fly zone. Before my arrest, I flew a bit.

I chartered a plane to take aerial photographs. The pilot was calm. I was calm.

I flew in commercial aircraft on business. When necessary, I flew second class. I preferred first class. I have fond memories of reclining under a warm blanket, sipping whiskey, and listening to Charlie Pride.

On vacation, I always travelled by boat, bus, car, or train. I don’t understand why people fly when they’re supposed to be on vacation. “It’s fast.” So what?

I spent most of the year hurrying to meetings, trials, court sessions, appointments. When planning a vacation, I carefully avoid anything that would cause me to be in a hurry.

If my wife was with me, I’d spend hours at the end of the day slowly bringing her to her ultimate destination. Then I’d roll over and allow myself to drift away. I felt like I was flying.
