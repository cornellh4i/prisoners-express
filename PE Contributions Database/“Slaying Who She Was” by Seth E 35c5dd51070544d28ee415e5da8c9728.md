**“Slaying Who She Was” by Seth E.**

****“I’d never have thought to see you kneeling here, Talia,” remarked the High Matron Uvas.  “What would make you take the Brand to that pretty face?”

Talia kept her head bowed respectfully, carefully not glancing at the runic branding on the left half of the High Matron’s face, the symbol of membership to the Order of the Matrons.  “I wish to be reborn, and to serve my Queen.”

“Hah!” scoffed Uvas. “The Queen, but not the King? Not the realm?”  Uvas put her fingers to Talia’s chin, lifting the woman’s eyes to her own.  “Rebirth requires you to slay the being you once were, dear.”

“Who I’ve been, High Matron, is little better than a calf raised for slaughter,” Talia replied with a little heat.  “I have seen myself as men see me. I feared aging, for men crave youth.  I have dressed shamelessly, for men crave my flesh. I have cowered when I speak, because men dismiss my thoughts and want me quiet.  I have decorated myself to attract their gaze, trampled my sisters for mens’ admiration, suffered torturers clothing to satisfy their own notions of beauty, and feigned interest for their insufferably self-centered blather.  My body has been clutched, grabbed, prodded, evaluated and compared for their amusement and pleasure, with never a thought for my mind or feelings, because to them I am theirs to own- - and I believed this as true.  My fear of their lusts dictates how I dress in public, where I go, what I drink, and yet they are not to blame when they violate me or other women.

“If that woman must die that I may be reborn into your Order as a woman of self possession, a woman with power, then I will be well rid of her.  And I will serve no man, ever again.”

High Matron Uvas peered intensely at Talia, then nodded.

“You are… angry, Talia.  Such anger is dangerous in one with power such as the Art.  Why would the Order risk teaching you dangerous magics when you so plainly disdain all men, even our own King?”

Talia’s heart dropped a beat.  She’d been too heated, lost her composure, exposed too much.  She saw failure ahead.

“I… I don’t disdain all men, High Mitron.  Not exactly.  It is… now the world is set against women, I disdain.  Men have dominance, even if they don’t know it or try to use it.  I want… I…” She struggled to find the words.  Uvas softly laid a hand upon Talia’s shoulder and supplied a possible continuance.

“You want to fix the imbalance?” Uvas asked.  Talia sighed.

“Yes, High Matron.” Talia replied, but still uncertain how this interview might go.

“Well,” Uvas said, straightening,  “,there is more to our Order than sisters and matrons, Talia.”  A new hope blossomed in her.  “Let us say that you would not be entirely alone in your perspectives in the company of certain members of the Order.  Ok, but first, get up from your knees, dear.”

Rising, Talia wasn’t sure what to say.  She’d never heard of anything but Sisters and Matrons, of various ranks.  “More than Sisters and Matrons, High Matron Uvas?”

“Yes,” the Matron smiled carefully.  “I shall provide you an introduction, and the Brand is placed… eh, elsewhere, let’s say,” Uvas cringed and touched at her left breast unconsciously.  “But you might find the Spiders to be quite a suitable match.”  Uvas guided Talia toward the entry to the temple.

Talia smiled a smile that she’d never smiled, before, triumphant.
