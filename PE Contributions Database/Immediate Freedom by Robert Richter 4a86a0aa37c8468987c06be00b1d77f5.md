**"Immediate Freedom" by Robert Richter**

Look how scared they were, having no idea that the brave Americans right behind them were about to free them forever from all of their problems. Not every American got to deliver freedom from high in the sky. The real heroes got down and dirty in the mud freeing the Vietnamese from their wretched existence, one shiny bullet at a time.

Calley or McCain, you know who I pick! No American ever committed a “war crime”! People who fight for freedom and democracy can do no wrong. Only evil people dare to resist us. Our bombs cannot kill the innocent. Trump got it right: real American heros don’t get captured. They slaughter the evil enemies of democracy, then return home free to their free country.

You can’t hide from freedom in a muddy, water-filled ditch. Freedom will find you! Our capitalist system gives us billions of dollars to spend on your freedom. You can’t resist a multi-million dollar airplane with a bag of communist rice. We sent our sons halfway around the world to free you, and they will, one way or another.
