**“Alone” by Tony Ball**

Alone. Alone and waiting. Alone and waiting in the city of lights. Waiting. Waiting for the sound of his footsteps on the hardwood floor. For the scent of him, mingled with the morning’s fresh brew. The coffee. He had perfected the skill of making coffee into art. She had never had a more perfect cup. Only Heaven knows how much she misses him. And his coffee. And his arms. And his loving. He had mastered the art of loving her. Multiple O’s of bliss exploding. One after another, like a 4th of July firework show’s grand finale. In the city of lights.

He missed his tools. His woodworking tools, with which he created marvels from wood. The smell of oak, the texture of cherry, the beauty of walnut. He missed building houses. His mechanical tools were bone too. The set his father gave him to restore the classic ‘65 Chevy truck and used to keep his bike running smooth, with its throaty growl. He missed tinkering with electronics, building PCs, and gaming too. But he really missed his kitchen “tools”; not so much the cooking itself, but the sleepy smile of content upon her lips as he kissed her awake with a stack of cinnamon-raisin french toast or blueberry pancakes with a side of vanilla ice cream. And coffee. Of course. She bragged of his coffee to her girlfriends, as if alluding to something else. The implications almost embarrassed him. Almost. How could this man, Witton, could work wonders with his hands. Witton had the gentlest of hearts, risk it all for a moments act of vengeance, a split-second’s bad decision of jealous rage and retribution, which isn’t worth wasting away a life behind bars, doing appeal after appeal from within this city of concrete and steel, a city of lights which never dim, awaiting a sentence that’s both fair and just, from a money-hungry justice system gone corrupt, fighting on his own, to return to his woman. In the city of lights. Waiting. Alone.
