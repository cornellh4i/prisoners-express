**"Girl On Bench" by Anonymous**

That girl on that park bench, brings memories.

I lived in Spokane, Washington. I was eighteen, and my girlfriend was sixteen. Sometimes we’d go to Manito Park and frolic on the big lawns around the junipers and pines. Other times we’d park on a bench to talk, cuddle, and smooch. On a few occasions, she got on a bench, just like in that picture, and I planked down on the ground at her waist and leaned back against the bench, and we’d talk over our shoulders to each other. She’d be inspecting her nails and her split ends, and we’d talk about our families, school gossip, movies -- you know, teen stuff.

This was in the early ‘60s. We weren’t sexually active yet, and hadn’t heard of the Beatles yet. JFK was still the president. The U.S. wasn’t fighting in Vietnam yet, but looked like we might send troops there eventually. We talked about that a little, and I told her that I was thinking of joining the Marines after I graduated.

Julie didn’t like that idea, and sat up and put her legs to both sides of my shoulders, and pushed my head forward and started picking at the back of my neck, while she told me “My father says we’re not going to win in Vietnam if we go over there and fight. He said those ‘little gooks’ are just like the Koreans, and we didn’t win in Korea. He said they’re tougher than they look, and they’re not scared o’ nothin’, and they know their turf and their people better than we do. If we go fight over there, we’re going over there on a fool’s errand.”

Her dad was no *peacenik,* but he was against the U.S. going to war in Vietnam. I had some romantic notions about going over there as a tough U.S. marine, kickin’ some commie ass, and coming back with war stories to swap with my dad.

Julie and I finally got up and walked over to a little neighborhood store and got a couple of bottles of pop, and I got some Hostess cupcakes. She didn’t want any junk food. She was always a smart and disciplined eater, and she had a beautiful complexion and a lithe, firm figure. I didn’t have any dietary concerns. I could eat anything that didn’t eat me first. I was an athlete for my high school, and had a pretty active lifestyle. I didn’t have a car yet. Drugs weren’t part of the local scene yet either. I smoked cigarettes. Julie didn’t smoke, and wanted me to quit. I tried to a couple of times. I loved her, and vowed to quit smoking, somehow, sooner or later. I smoked a lot less whenever we were together.

I eventually graduated, and started school at the community college. Kennedy was assassinated. Things got hot in Vietnam. I enlisted -- in the Air Force. Julie was happy I wasn’t going to Vietnam, at least not as a marine or a soldier. She and my family saw me off at the airport.

My family loved her, too, and her family loved me. I was thinking of marrying her after she graduated. I wrote to her and my family, and she always sent me perfumed letters. I got through boot camp, and was sent to technical training school in Amarillo, Texas. I got one letter there from Julie, and then no more. I hadn’t heard from my parents in a while, either. Then I finally got the news from my parents. Julie had been out with some friends, in her friend’s car. As they were crossing an intersection … a speeder ran a red light … three of the four girls were killed. My Julie was one of them.

I couldn’t finish the letter … my eyes … they … I seemed to have “caught a cold”. I had to go blow my nose.

My hands were shaking. I went to my room in the barracks. My roommates weren’t there. I composed myself and struggled through the letter, then I lay down on my bunk and wept, and cried myself to sleep. I didn’t want to live anymore. I couldn’t believe it, my baby was gone. I mourned for a long time. Well, I was nearly twenty. I wrote a short, but nice letter of condolence to Julie’s parents. I wept again, and let some tears fall on the letter and smear some ink. I was young and resilient, and gradually got over it … mostly.

After I finished my training, I transplanted to California. Years, decades, a marriage and a divorce later, in July, 1992, I took a week’s 4th of July vacation from work, and headed up to Spokane in my jeep to visit my parents. My seventeen year old son went with me. We spent a few days with my parents, and saw my cousins, and tripped around Spokane a little. My son and I stopped in Manito Park, and we got out and walked around. I told him a little about how a girlfriend and I used to frolic here an’ there. There we sat down on a bench and talked a little. Then it got quiet, and I went “AWOL” for a minute. I missed her. I still loved her. Then I heard “Dad… dad… yo, dad,” he touched my arm, and I heard Scott calling “Dad…”

I came back, looked at him, grinned and said “Excuse me. Trippin’ down memory lane here.”

We went back to the Jeep and got in, and I sat there staring blankly out the windshield. Pretty soon he was dingin’ me again. I told him about the park bench, and briefly, what happened. He stared silently out the windshield, then said “Damn, dad… (sigh) what a bomb, I’m sorry.” I cleared my throat, and said,

“Yeah. That was a long time ago. I had to do this. Closure, ya’ know?” He nodded. I said, “Well, how about we go get a bite to eat, huh?”

“Yeah, dad. Good idea.”
