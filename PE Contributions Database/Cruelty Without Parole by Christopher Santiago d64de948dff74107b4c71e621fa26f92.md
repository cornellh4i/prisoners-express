**Cruelty Without Parole by Christopher Santiago**

Ben was one of the few convicts who had earned my trust. He and I were both in our early thirties, both from “up North,” and both serving life without parole at the same maximum-security prison in South Carolina.

One night, while walking the prison’s upper tier, I spotted Ben heading my way with a smile on his face. As we neared each other, he reached out with a smile on his face. As we neared each other, he reached out and embraced me with both arms.

“I love you, Santiago,” he said.

The hug was as unexpected as it was unusual, and I did not reciprocate. I stood like a statue with my arms rigid at my sides. *People don’t just hug each other like this in prison,* I thought.

“I… uh… love you, too, bro,” I managed, pulling away.

It felt awkward. At a loss for what to say, I turned around and fast-walked in the opposite direction. I had no idea Ben was about to commit suicide.

Imagine spending the rest of your life locked inside a tiny prison cell the size of a parking space with no hope of ever being released. How long could you endure being trapped in a dungeon while simply waiting to die? That is what it means to serve life-without-parole sentence, condemned to die on America’s slow death row.

There are over 200,000 people serving life sentences in the United States, and despite the declining crime rates, our number is growing. America locks up more people for life than any other country.

“I’m sorry, but if I had a life sentence, I would just kill myself.” Over the years, more people have said this to me than I can recall. I’ve heard it from prison guards and from my fellow inmates. I’ve even heard it from my own family. And every time I hear it, I think of Ben. I remember the decision he made. I lament the fact that I couldn’t stop him from taking his own life. Couldn’t even return his goodbye hug.

It’s 5:45 a.m., and I’m lying on a thin piece of plastic-covered foam that I refuse to call a mattress. My back aches, and my right arm is stiff. Still in my orange prison uniform, I swing my legs over the side of my bunk and place my feet into a pair of tattered, white sneakers. Joints pop as I struggle to stand and stretch. *What will ‘life’ throw at me today?* I wonder.

I study my reflection in a slab of polished steel bolted to the concrete wall of my cell. Dark circles ring my tired eyes. My hair is thin and graying. I clip my prison ID card to the left collar of my uniform. In the ID photo, my hair doesn’t look so gray. *I’m almost dead*, I tell myself. My ID card might as well be a toe tag identifying a walking corpse. Killing myself would be redundant.

Everyday, I wake up and convince myself not to commit suicide. Not to give into the same hopelessness and despair that crushed Ben’s will to live. To find some meaning in the suffering. To live in a way that is sane. Everyday I wake up to attend my own funeral.

I acknowledge that what I did— the horrible crime I committed 18 years ago— was wrong. If I could go back in time and change what happened, I would. I cannot possibly regret what I did more than I already do. Just thinking about it makes me wish I had never been born.

But no matter how sorry I am, no matter how much guilt or remorse I feel, I remain labeled an irredeemable person. While other inmates can reduce the amount of time they spend in prison by earning time-credits for good behavior, work, and education, there is nothing I can do that could possibly reduce my life sentence. What incentive do I have to obey the prison rules? Why should I continue to pursue my education? I’ll never sit for a job interview or be evaluated by a parole board. My sentence places me beyond redemption.

Not only is life without parole irreducible, it also cannot be extended. If I were to commit additional crimes, no more time could possibly be added to my sentence. Why should I live in accordance with the law? More importantly, why is our criminal justice system turning hundreds of thousands of Americans into an unpunishable class of hopeless convicts with nothing left to lose?

It’s called a “life” sentence, but that’s a misnomer. The truth is, life without parole is death by incarceration. It’s death in slow motion. I am not “doing life”; I am simply going through the motions of being alive. Trying to piece something together from the wreckage of my life. I am lying in a casket, waiting for someone to close the lid.

What is the purpose of a life-without-parole sentence? Does locking people like Ben in prison with no prospect of release accomplish anything besides cruelty at the taxpayers’ expense? What about lifers who are no longer dangerous? Don’t they deserve a second chance? What about the lifers who have “aged out” of criminal behavior and are no longer the same people they were decades earlier? Don’t they deserve even the *possibility* of parole? These are questions we need to ask ourselves as a society.

Life-without-parole sentences are pointless and cruel. Nobody deserves to be punished to the end of their life. As a democratic society, we should recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all people. Human beings have the capacity for positive change and personal transformation, and if people can change, so, too, can their laws.

It’s time for sentencing laws in America to change. Life-without-parole sentences serve no purpose except sadism and schadenfreude. There should be no place in a civilized society for this level of cruelty. Everyone deserves a second chance, and once an offender has served a reasonable sentence, our laws should afford him or her an opportunity to rejoin society. That’s what Ben would have wanted. It’s what he deserved.

It’s time to end life imprisonment. For more information, visit Endlifeimprisonment.org.
