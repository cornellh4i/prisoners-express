**“The Piping Princess” by Phillip L. Rath**

Hair of gold, with silver adorning her ears and a spotted leopard pelt draping her shoulder. Alexis, the piping princess of the forest plays her magical flute to attract the winds that bring the rains which cause the flowers to grow to feed the butterflies and fill the air with their aromatic delights.

At the sound of her pipes the birds soar higher on the warming winds, fish swim freely among the gentle waves and the animals of the earth roam leisurely across the budding plains.

The piping princess spreads her peace and love across the land among the notes of her music, sent aloft on the warm breezes of the season.

Awaken us, Alexis! Play out your blissful tune for our pleasure. Now, more than ever, we need the power of your music to soothe the raging beasts of human nature.
