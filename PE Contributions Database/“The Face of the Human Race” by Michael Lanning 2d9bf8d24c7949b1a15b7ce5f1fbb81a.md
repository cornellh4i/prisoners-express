**“The Face of the Human Race” by Michael Lanning**

****Look at this face. Do you see you, me, all of humanity? Look at the white race in me. Just that part of me doesn’t make me always right. How about the black race in me. Does that part of me remain seated in the back? See the brown race in me. Should that part of me stay down? What about the yellow race in me. Why is that part of me considered someone below? And the red race in me. Since when has that part of me become dead?

You see the individual white race, black race, brown race, yellow race, and red race. You see differences from your own biased inferences. Look closer. Now do you see the blended rainbow in this face? For I am you. And I am me. I am the face of all the human race!
