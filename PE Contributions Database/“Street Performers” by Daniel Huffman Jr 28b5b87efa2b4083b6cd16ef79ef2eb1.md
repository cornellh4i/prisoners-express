**“Street Performers” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

Two street performers stand in, wait for the next go

For they have a story to show

Nameless, faceless, speechless, yet full of emotion

Every movement planned and practised with such devotion

“Breaking The Chains” is the name of the performance

It’s a reminder of oppression and a people’s torments

Passersby toss coins at their feet

They perform in the cold of winter all the way to the summer’s heat

Some people may think it all a bit strange

But they will continue to perform until there is a change

So take a lesson from the street performers if you can

There is only one race of woman or man

We are all human, just some have a better tan
