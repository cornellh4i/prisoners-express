***Mississippi Mud Dog* by Curtis Colvin**

About 40 years ago there was this couple who lived by the mississippi river in the delta. They had a son who was about 5 years old. One day, during a hard freeze, their son left out the back door for some reason. Probably to be adventurous. He ended up walking on top of the frozen river for the bubbles and movement below the ice was strange to watch.

About that time his mother noticed him missing. His father found his tracks leaving out the back door. Following them he came upon his son walking on the thin ice. A sudden “crack” sounded out and his son fell in. Before the man knew it, his son was swept down river. He tried to catch up, but the current was too fast.

Then a sudden movement from the other bank caught his eye. A dog jumped into the water and the timing was just right to where it collided with his son. His first thought was a wolf and it was going to eat his son. His first thought was a wolf and it was going to eat his son. But the dog grabbed the boy’s shirt with it’s teeth and kept swimming, ending up on the man’s side of the bank. As soon as the man ran up, the dog took off.

He got his son home, and was grateful that the dog saved him. The man kept putting food out for it to eat, but only other animals would show up and eat. He still saw the dog every once in awhile from a distance, then he would disappear, tracks and all.

Years would go by, and the boy grew up and stayed on his father’s land. He still sees the dog from time to time whose image sometimes is only an outline which fades away. But one year after putting out those cameras which take quick pictures of the wildlife, he caught a picture of his saving hero from years ago, the mississippi mud dog.
