**“Four Dogs” by Andrew Barlett Sr.**

Officer Jolly’s keys clanked and jingled incessantly as he walked between the rows of bunk beds. He went to locker #123 opened It with his master key, and put something into it. Then he quietly closed It and resumed his walk. Several inmates saw him but said nothing. Paul’s meeting with the investigating officer was short and sweet. He didn’t know what she was talking about. He locked his locker and never used crack. He didn’t even know what it looked like. His D.H.O. “hearing” was even quicker. His time in the hole was long and terrible. Scientists say more than three days of 24/7 hole time produced visible brain damage. Paul believed It. Paul had hoped to be home for Christmas but, having lost good time and his job, he had to serve almost two months beyond his minimum. He spent much of his time researching and planning. Jolly took the sergeant’s exam in January. Three weeks later, he was notified that he had passed. He was given a patch with three stripes. On the way home, he picked up a frozen pizza, a needle and a spool of thread, and four cans of dog food. He was in a hurry. He didn’t usually text while driving, but that afternoon he needed to send a message to his friends. After he got a quick shower and fed the dogs, it would be time to party! When he got home, Jolly tossed his gun belt onto the couch, threw the pizza into the microwave, opened the dog food cans and stepped out the back door. He heard no dogs barking. Something struck him from behind. When he woke up, he didn’t know that two days had passed, or that his dogs hadn’t eaten in four days. His hands and feet were bleeding. Paul was standing over him spraying mace. Jolly tried to yell “How’d you get my mase?” But what came out was comically shrill and distorted. Helium was hissing near his face.

“You left it right on the couch,” Paul said. Then he blew a silent whistle. Jolly heard his dogs barking. The mase irritated their noses. They didn’t recognize their master, but they smelled blood and they were very hungry.
