**"Fitting In" by Donald Dickson**

The day that big old white bus rolls up to the gate in Huntsville everyone on it fits into the penal system. Eventually they will arrive at their assigned units. The first deciding factor in figuring where these men fit in was decided by them. The second was made for them, by those running the institution. The biggest factor was made after they were assigned to their units. For example, our dayroom has eight tables. Each table is occupied by a different group. Those that fit-in with those at the domino table will just sit among that group. Those that fit-in with the religious group will sit at just that table.

Each participant seeks where they fit-in. I think all through mankind, man was always seeking that particular group to which he could fit-in. Early man did it for protection and sociability. I believe it's still inbred in mankind today. The common thread of acceptance is being beneficial. You must bring something to the group.

But whether inside prison walls or outside in the free world if you do not obey the rules of the group then you no longer fit-in.
