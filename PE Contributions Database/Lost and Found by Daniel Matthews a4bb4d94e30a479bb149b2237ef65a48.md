**“Lost and Found” by Daniel Matthews**

****I’ve found, after all the years, all the changes. I’m still an artist. I always have been; I always will be. It’s where I find myself every time. Every time I’m lost, ever since the first time I was ever truly lost, I found myself. Poetry found me. Art found me, and it has saved my life everyday ever since. I guess it’s natural when you are overflowing with so much life and emotion but are without a way to experience them. Art being life is where I always find myself and where I find the world around me.

Art can get me out of any situation, emotion, and experience, and I can use it to bring or release anything and immortalize it. A story, an element, or a memory, wherever I look, I find it all in my art. What better place to find yourself when you are lost? Your thoughts become tangible, the images in your mind become real and expressible, the world becomes your stage, and you learn that if and when others say life is politics, math, science, or religion, you can show them all that life is art. Life is art.

I found myself, once upon a time ago, with poetry. I remember my first poems, almost all I’ve ever written. I knew before writing the first one that I had “talent,” but it always meant much more than that to me. I just knew it, just as I know myself. I had found myself, and I would never forget it.
