**"Simple Pleasures" by Donald Coffey**

Everyone has there own Simple Pleasures. As for me my simple pleasures can go a long way. For being behind bars most simple pleasures are taken away, such as sitting in the woods in the middle of the night and relaxing. Driving a car on an empty highway and burying the speedometer. Working on an engine and playing on the computer.

You don't realize the simple pleasures of life until they're taken away from you and it gets you depressed thinking about it. But it just reminds you that life IS NOT OVER.
