**"The Longest Trip" by James R. Ormand**

Some of my best memories are of the many road trips that we took as a family while living in Germany. Most of the time it was my father’s idea. Me, I was just a little kid and perfectly happy staying at home playing with my friends. Yet, my father insisted that every weekend that we, as a family, would go on a road trip and go sight-seeing. This included seeing as many castles and taking as many pictures as we could. My father has been gone from this world for 10 years now. Those road trips are some of my best memories of my father. Every weekend he would fill the ice cooler up with cokes and sandwiches and off we would go.

On one of these road trips, a fairly long one at that, I remember that I had drunk about 3 colas. Now, I am sure we are all aware of the fact that a kid’s bladder doesn’t hold much. So, as my sister and I are in the back seat of our BMW talking and looking out the windows, I feel that familiar sensation telling me that I had to use the bathroom. I let my father know of this situation and what does he say? Yep, you guessed it, “Hold it until we get there.”

I was doing that little dance we all do when we were kids and had to “go.” I just knew that if I couldn’t go soon I was going to die! I looked around the back seat searching for a bottle, and luckily I discovered one. I begged my father to let me go, but once again, I was told to wait. I waited a couple of minutes and then started to roll down my window so that I could distract myself from the pain. No sooner did I get the window halfway down when my father yelled at me to roll the window back up. Denied that avenue of relief, I had no choice but to hold it. My dance was getting more lively by the minute. One mile turned into 10. 10 turned into 20 and 20 miles turned into 50. This whole time I’m dancing in my seat holding myself and crying because it hurt so badly.

Finally, after an hour of letting my father know I had to go, we, at last, arrived at our destination. I saw a bathroom at the gas station we had stopped at and I ran as fast as I could to that bathroom. I swear I stood in front of that urinal for a full minute. Let me tell you, there is nothing in the world that feels better than peeing after you have been holding it for an hour. After using the bathroom and getting back in the car, we made our way up the mountain to go visit a castle. After that day, I never had more than one soda. I did not want to go through that torture again.
