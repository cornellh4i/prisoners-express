**Running by Travis Mayash AKA Nuclear Death**

I feel as though I have spent all my life running. Whether it was from something like responsibility or towards things like drugs and fast cash, I realize that I could never be happy in the moment, never took time to sit and take a moment to think where I want life to go. To sit and wonder why I can’t just sit in the moment, to enjoy the day for what it may be, I still want to run to the next great thing, whether it’s a concert that I walk away with a concussion, or working seven days a week because I’m running to pay the bills, or rushing to finish another art project, just for another dollar of two, before I realize years have gone by and all I have really done is run out of time. I should have been running towards my children, my wife, the mother of my second child, my parents, and friends, I could say that I’m sorry but then I’m just running towards an easy fix. I think I’m done running. It is time to live in the moment, but for once I’m not running from it. I don’t know what I will run towards next, but I think that maybe I will stretch and warm up a little before I take off for the next Big Thing in my life, maybe.
