**“Spark of Inspiration” by David Irons**

****Many have drawn inspiration from those who have taken down a foe, jumped from an airplane, or survived a lengthy time in the wild. This inspiration drives them to discover their own strength to embrace who they are and share their creative abilities with others. Such events like these are commonly called a leap of faith.

While I have discovered a lot of things that I take joy in doing, I have yet to wholeheartedly commit to discovering my created purpose. I’m not even sure if making such a commitment would lead to or actually be a leap of faith. As much as I ache to each such a moment, I know it is not something I have the power to bring about. If it is meant to happen, it just will.

In the September 2016 edition of the digital photo magazine I read a quote by Brene Brown that said, “Owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we’ll ever do.” Ever since I read those words, it has been clear to me there awaits a discovery for me, should I pursue the understanding contained in those words. To travel down that road, I would need the strength to share my deepest pain and my greatest joy. As a novice writer in the early phases of developing my story, at times I feel bold and ready, and at other times, I avoid pen and page as though facing death itself. Either way, I’m drawn to write.
