**“Celtic Fires” by James Cepak**

A brand new day

With an unlimited flame

Celtic Fires play

And sing of ancient names

Faeries answer like little dancers

The flames draw sprite flights

Waters burble bringing pixie prances

With flute songs lit from reed pipes

Atlantis air arrives from flights

Where fancy and fantasy set reality right

Imaginations greatest images soar

To bring life, breath, and being more

Celtic fires burn

Creating life in turns

Celtic fires rise

And fade with life’s tides

Celtic fires feed

All the dreams we need

To know, live and be,

Celtic fires!

– James Cepak
