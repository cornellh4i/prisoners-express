Man! Well I remember back in my days as a kid when our dad would give us our allowance every Friday a dollar. That was back in ‘65 - I was five then - then it went to dollar and a quarter - but with fifty cents I could buy me a lot of candies and still have some ‘till our next allowance - the movies back then were $1.50, for kids $1.00 - man! Those were really so good old days - and as I was growing I still remember watching TV: Abbot and Costello, The Three Stooges, Batman and Robin, Superman in B/W, the Waltons, Gunsmoke, Wagon Train, Rawhide Bonanza, The Fugitive, Grizzly Adams, M*A*S*H* and Andy Griffith, so on...but every Saturday I would wake up early to watch Popeye, Tom and Jerry, He-Man, Mighty Mouse, The Monsters - oh yeah and The Smurfs, than we would watch Soul Train and American Bandstand - while our mom would be getting breakfast ready our dad would be sleeping his hangover off from last night - I remember taking one of our dad’s beer - while my brother and I would drink it - or we would steal a can of beer off the store - also I remember this store selling single cigarettes if they didn’t have enough for the whole pack - back then they would sell it to kids - all we had to say “It’s for my Dad and Mom” - Man!

I’m here sitting in my cell listening to my radio listening to the sixties, seventies music - every time I hear the song “Joy To The World” it shoots me back when I was in sixth grade we each in class had to play something on stage. So me and a few of my friends talked it over, we wanted to do something - then one of the guys said let’s do The Osmonds’ “One Bad Apple”. Then the other guy said I know let’s do the Three Dog Night “Joy To The World”. But I told them cool but where are we going to get the instruments to do the play? Believe it or not one of the guys talked to our teacher and she got us the instruments - so we practiced - no the guitars didn’t have the strings - but we did very well. So every time I hear “Joy To The World” brings me good memories.

Then we moved after a while to the east side where I met my candy girl - I really didn’t like living there. At first because I was away from my friends and my special friend we’ve spent a lot of time together - then I got used to being around my candy girl - then we moved again - then I had my bike I would go to my special friend - but he had moved -

I got with this girl we both were twelve years old. They started calling us Sonny and Cher - because she had long beautiful hair and she was a little taller than I - you know the show “The Wonder Years”? The girl Winnie - reminds me a lot of Emily...and that’s why when they told us we were moving to Lubbock - I decided to run away ‘cause I was sick and tired of moving and I didn’t want to leave my girlfriend and my friends - So I would stay with some friends or my loves I had - We were staying with his uncle -

Sometimes I would wander around the streets all night sniffing paint - back then people didn’t lock their cars - because back then there wasn’t a lot of car theft like now - and people won’t lock their doors nor started putting bars on their doors and windows like now - back then it was safer, peaceful - and back then our priests had the right to spank us if we did something wrong - but they did it ‘cause they love us and didn’t want us to know they don’t care and these days I’ve seen kids running around the streets, smoking, doing as they wish - I’ve heard some of these guys even saying they’ve been in TUC when they were twelve-thirteen - of cause yeah - I had some high shoes, bell bottoms and I remember buying different kinds of beads and making necklaces or sewing some on my jackets and bikes - man! To me they were the coolest because my first bike I had had stickers of the 49ers and my friends and I turned out bikes into choppers and we would ride around - we had balloons on the back tires and they would sound like the real thing, a motorcycle -

Boy those were some good old days.

My homeboys have told me that San Antonio has changed a lot since Old Wood is not there anymore, they renamed the hospital and the elementary school where we played on stage and sang “Joy To The World” - I’ve been gone from there a long time - it has been forty-three years the last time I’ve seen my hometown...
