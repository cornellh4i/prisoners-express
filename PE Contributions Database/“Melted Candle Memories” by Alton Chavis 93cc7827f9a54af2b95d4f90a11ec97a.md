**“Melted Candle Memories” by Cambren Thomas**

Birthdays have come to mean so much more to me since being incarcerated. Every single New Year’s Eve, which is my actual birth date, will now be a bittersweet occurrence for me. What would usually be a time of celebration will now bring forth fading memories of a happy past and the hard reality of my present and future. Birthdays take me back to my childhood days when I used to have all the birthday cake, ice cream, pizza, and fun I could stomach. I remember my young-adult days, when my birthdays were drunk and marijuana-stenched blurs.

I will reflect on my birthdays as both a husband and father, when the festivities were lighter but far more comforting and heartfelt. There was truly nothing like my wife taking me out for a nice dinner, or seeing the beautifully scribbly-scrabbly birthday card my young daughter had made for me. Those subtle moments in time, of feeling like royalty amongst my queen and princess, will always make me smile. But my most favorite birthday memories aren’t even about me. I will regard the moments from my daughter’s birthdays the most.

One of my fondest memories is from my Pumpkin’s 1st birthday. I remember baking and decorating an awesome Doc-McStuffin’s themed cake for her. I mean, I put some time and thought into this thing----it had the sugar sparkles and pearls, Doc stickers and lettering, cool swirls in the icing, and a big numero uno in the middle. So my wife and I Iit the candles and sang, and my Pumpkin just sat there looking like “WTF is this, guys?” It was so hilarious, watching a one-year old reject my coveted confectionary creation. Her reaction was the exact opposite of those YouTube videos where the baby just dives into the cake with their hands and mouth in a hungry frenzy. You see, at the time my Pumpkin was one of those rare kids who actually loved fruit and veggies more than sugary treats. I will never forget recording her as she stuck out her finger, grabbed a sample of strawberry icing, put it on her tongue, and gave the cutest look of disgust. My pumpkin got more enjoyment eating her Gerber veggie medley, fruit cup, drinking her water, and tearing up the wrapping paper on her gifts that day.

That was just one of many brief but “happy” birthday moments I had with my Pumpkin that, as I fast forward through my time here, will always bring solace to my mind. It is definitely the small things that tend to have the most impact on you behind these bars. They say you never truly appreciate something until you face a loss--- and I have lost BIG, so my amount of appreciation for days like birthdays is on a gigantic scale now. From the tender birthday memories of making my now ex-wife feel special on her day, to my younger days when I would cook my mother a birthday breakfast in bed meal, to a few days ago when I had wished my dad a happy 60th birthday through a telephone receiver along with a card made of notebook paper. These moments are even more special and meaningful to me now. My detachment from outside society has made nothing but a positive impact on my attachment to my loved ones.

Birthday candles may melt away to nothing as the flame burns on and seconds pass---but my birthday memories, my thoughts, my LOVE (for those I love), will remain through the receding flame of my imprisonment.
