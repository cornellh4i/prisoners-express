“Thwarted” James Bauhaus #88367-6C102

This is what the lower classes are; We people who work hard for a living. We live hard, short lives of suffering, poverty, sickness and pain, then die early after having helped others prosper and party If you break a sweat for a wage, you are underpaid. You are a member of the vast horde of prey who keep everyone above you too rich. We used to be called slaves, but then we worked our way up to become serfs. More progress was made when we elevated ourselves to become sharecroppers. More hard work got us promoted to the proletariat, or working class.

Even here, however, the privileged and pampered classes thwart us. Just notice how they starve-out teachers, fight to make school into church, dumb town the curricula every year and allow problem children to cheat everyone else out of learning how to think. This does not happen by accident. People who can think properly are very dangerous, especially when they learn how writing is so much more effective than talking. Any idiot can talk, and their idiocy fades quickly back unto the emptiness as soon as it is said, but writing, it is much more than just noise. It takes care, preparation and thought. And, when it is good, it lasts for thousands of years, influencing billions of people.

But even writers are often thwarted. Just look at the extreme high cost of college education. The parasite classes off people who make their living by loaning out their money make certain that education is the most expensive thing in the world when it should be free. Too many educated people are very dangerous to people who are merely too rich, too privileged, and too advantaged. In every case where the prey classes have managed to elevate ourselves, we did it in two steps: First, we educated ourselves; then we overthrew the parasite classes that were keeping us thwarted,

The pampered classes call us “The Teeming Masses”. This is because they are terrified by us. They know history. They know that when we wake up, it always turns into a disaster for them. All their tricks and traps eventually get found out, but only after very long intervals of them living it up before they finally die, usually of depravity, debauchery, and decadence, peacefully in their beds. The good really do die young; the cussed ones seem to live forever. Most of them never do get even the smallest taste of being thwarted.
