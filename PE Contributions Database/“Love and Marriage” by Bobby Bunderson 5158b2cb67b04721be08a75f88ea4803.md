**“Love and Marriage” by Bobby Bunderson**

****“Love and marriage, love and marriage, goes together like a horse and carriage, let me tell your brother- you can’t have one without the other…” And boy don’t I know it! I have been married three disastrous times. I married my first wife eleven months after getting out of prison for the first time. I married the “lucky lady” on my sentencing day, in the holding cell in the courthouse, before starting my second prison term. That marriage lasted almost six years and resulted in us having a daughter. It didn’t end well for either of us.

I married the second “lucky lady” three months after being released from my third term in prison. (A fifteen year term for, get this, kidnapping my first wife!) That marriage lasted a few months.

My third marriage took place in the visiting room of Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California. We wed on the same day in which we actually met face-to-face for the first time. This whirlwind romance endured for about seven years. Is there a theme here?

Okay let’s backtrack. Wife number one: an absolute beauty, but very broken. Not unlike myself. However, she luckily made something of her life after she shed 220 pounds of excess baggage: me. Wifey number two as it turned out was a crackhead prostitute. All I can say is that the sex was good.

Wife number three didn’t quite understand what my sentence of twenty-five years to life actually meant. And, the state of California had done away with conjugal visits which was more than she could handle. (Hey Lora, we’ve got our conjugals back!)

Love and marriage. Well, after years of therapy and self-help groups I finally understand the importance of self-love before trying to bestow it upon someone else. I finally understand codependency and toxic relationships. I have finally come to a place where I could be, if given the chance, in a healthy relationship. I am madly in love and yet I seriously doubt her and I will ever make that commitment. I’ve had plenty of marriage without the love and now plenty of love without the marriage. Go figure…
