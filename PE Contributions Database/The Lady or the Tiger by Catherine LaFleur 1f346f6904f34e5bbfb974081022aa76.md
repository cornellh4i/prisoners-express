**The Lady or the Tiger by Catherine LaFleur**

Yes, I know, I am responsible for my own moods. It’s just that I hate the bad timing. Every single month. If only I could find some way to blame a man for all this trouble. Alas, I can’t find a way to make men responsible for my menstrual cycle.

Shudder distastefully if you must. Fall onto your fainting couch, but I just can’t talk about erectile dysfunction or prostate issues. And by the way it seems pretty unfair that men get to live decades until they have to deal with that while women have troubles for the majority of their lives.

Doubtless other women dance under a full moon to deal with the vicissitudes of femininity. I turn into a tiger woman. PMS, it’s a bitch goddess I’m forced to serve. And as I’m getting older, I find it’s getting worse, not better as was promised by my first gynecologist. These days anything can set me off general conversation, the cheerfulness of other people, the sounds of breathing.

Is PMS real, I know you may be skeptical. Oh yeah, it’s very real and unmedicated without herbal tea in prison it’s no joke. It makes demands like chocolate, coca-cola, pepperoni pizza and verbal evisceration of all human life surrounding me.

For one week every month I must fake everything, my smile, my basic humanity, my love for my family and friends. Seriously, I deserve some sort of recognition–perhaps an award given after my cycle is over of course.
