**“The Long Pier” by Rath Pier**

Occasionally, throughout my life, I have been told to take a long walk off a short pier, but here I was this morning walking down a long pier on an idyllic lake nestled between majestic mountains. What was the meaning of this and how did I get here? My body feels empty of all tension and stress and my mind seems to be floating in the ether between life and fantasy. Did I slip and fall into a sensory deprivation chamber, or what?

I feel as if I’ve wandered into the world of hyperbole and stereotypes. The crystal lake with the undisturbed surface. Emerald green mountains illuminated by the rising illuminated by the rising sun. Distant birds chirping and singing their merriment. A gentle breeze warming my skin as it gently wafts by. A glistening fish arches out of the water creating a gentle splash, leaving behind the only meandering ripples as evidence of its existence.

Have I entered a third dimensional world created by the imaginative wanderings of my mind or am I fast asleep and simply enjoying my subconscious fantasies of a peaceful existence?

Longing for the truth of my existence I reach out with my five senses to ascertain the reality of the situation and discover I am not asleep, fantasizing, or walking in the third dimension. I slowly realize I am merely enjoying the Winter 2019 Prisoner Express Newsletter, Picture Theme, on page 28. Thanks PE for once again allowing me to fly free in my mind.
