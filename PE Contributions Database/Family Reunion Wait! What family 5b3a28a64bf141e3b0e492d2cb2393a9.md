**"Family Reunion: Wait! What family?" by Robert Richter**

I have seen exactly one member of my family in 22 years. My little brother came to see me a couple of times, a few years ago. My question to you is this: What kind of family reunion can I ever expect to have? I have an old letter from my mother in which she wrote: “Not a day goes by that I don’t think about you.” That’s all she ever did, think about me. When I used to think about going back to her house, I knew exactly how she would act; the part of the tearful, loving mother whose long-lost son has returned. Yeah, right. I haven’t received a package, visit, or penny from her.

How about a reunion with my other relatives? That isn’t going to work either. My mother told me many years ago that she had been lying to my Finnish relatives. So far as I know, they don’t even know that I’m in prison. I have nieces, nephews, and cousins who might not even know that I exist. I can’t have a reunion when there was never a union. The irony is killing me: the only family I want to meet is the ones I haven’t.

Family reunion is not in my future. What could I ever talk to my nieces and nephews about; how their parents, my own brothers and sisters, abandoned me when some complete stranger set me up? I can’t even imagine what kind of lies my siblings have spoon-fed to their kids to justify how they left me to rot. Family reunion? I have no family.
