**“Prison Bird Bus Blues” by Jason Miears**

Every time I get on one of those “Blue Birds”, what we call prison buses, I feel like throwing up. I used to love going on road trips, but now I can’t stand being in a vehicle. The thought of going on a medical chain to see a specialized doctor always brings me anxiety. The trip always begins with an unexpected wakeup call at around 12:30 AM. An officer rudely wakes you up, yells at you, and tells you to pack your belongings because you’re on “chain.”

As it occurs this morning, I can barely believe it is happening to me again. As I pack all of my belongings in a red chain bag, I think to myself that it might be worth it to refuse this trip and take the major case they would write up for refusing the medical chain. As the officer takes my bag and I follow him to breakfast, I see all of the other miserable souls who will be traveling with me on this journey. Every time I get to this point, my stomach is uncontrollably upset. I refuse the cold pancakes they serve and get ready for the cold hard journey on an empty stomach. Once everybody is finished eating, we are packed into a room where every thirty minutes, a group of names is called and the men are shipped off on a bus.

When I finally hear my name, I line up in pairs with all of the others along the wall. All of us are handcuffed to each other as we are prodded onto the bus like cattle. Like the other person I am chained to and I find a seat, I already begin to sweat. Prison buses in Texas are unbelievably hot. Riding in this Texas hot sun with no air conditioning has known to cause numerous inmates to have visions or even pass out. I can tell the next 4-hour drive to our destination will be no picnic.

Slowly, the bus makes its way outside the prison gates. Once we reach the highway, all of our metal seats rattle uncontrollably. The constantly uncomfortable vibrations prevent us from trying to nap or even to feel the slightest bit relaxed. *Clink, rattle, clink, rattle*. All 50-plus inmates are like the cooking of instant popcorn. As the journey arrives at its midway point, my handcuffed partners begin to get on my nerves. He loudly talks to homeboys he hasn’t seen in a while and every time he moves, he moves me with him. Then the worst comes. He has to use the restroom.

As we get up and move in between the aisle, everyone snickers. At the end of the row is a smelly toilet that refuses to flush. As he urinates, I think to myself what a relief it will be when I no longer have to go to the doctor for my deteriorating eyesight. When he finally finishes, I find his piss stains all over my shoes. Finally, after the constant stop and go, we arrive at our destination in town. When I get off the bus and they take the handcuffs off of us, I can hardly believe we made it. I am led to the holding area they have for us and ponder this horrible situation. Should I refuse a future visit if they determine I need surgery? Will I have the same obnoxious chain mate that I had this morning? My thoughts keep obsessively going over this situation. Road trips while being incarcerated make me want to scream!
