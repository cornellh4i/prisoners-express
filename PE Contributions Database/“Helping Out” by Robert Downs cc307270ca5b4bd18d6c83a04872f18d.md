**“Helping Out” by Robert Downs**

If I could, and if my writing becomes worthy enough, I’d like to help people with my words, my vowels and consonants. I’d like my writing -- essays, dark poetry, fiction -- to find its way to those who need it, those who have these thoughts and feelings.

I suffer from an ever-growing depression and an anxiety that has a hair trigger. I want to let those like me (or anyone) know that they are not alone, that it’s okay to ask for help like I did. I refuse to be a helpless victim any longer. I’m taking a stand against these debilitating stains on my soul, and I hope my writing will encourage others to take a stand against theirs. It’s a dangerous and treacherous road, this guerrilla warfare against yourself, and I hope my writing will be a helping hand, the reinforcements that comes to the aid or rescue.

Helping others with their darkness helps me battle mine, believe it or not. I gather strength and courage from the helping. I don’t care about receiving credit, fame, or fortune from my words; I’m only concerned with delivering succor to those in need and in distress. Just thinking about it while I write this gives me hope and energy.

If I can help just one person with my letters, words, and sentences (along with a heavy does of punctuation marks), then all of this pain and torment will be a small price to pay and inconsequential speck of dirt. The deadweight of this depression won’t weigh me down; nor would it keep me from smiling or laughing.

So here I sit with guill in hands as I work on my craft, my passion. I work at it every day, and won’t stop until I’m published. I’ve structured my day around reading and writing -- reading to fuel my writing, and writing to fuel my soul. I hope I don’t fail; I hope my attempts don’t come crashing down in flames.
