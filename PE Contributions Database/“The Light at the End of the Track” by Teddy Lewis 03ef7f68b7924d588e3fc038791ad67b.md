**“The Light at the End of the Track”** by Teddy Lewis

Can you see the light shining inside my heart? It's being projected at you right now, but unfortunately there are facades, images, and trials blocking it at times from being seen.

At times these big city streets cause the lights to appear strange and “watered down”, yet time does fix and heal the wounded track/ and suddenly the light shines like never before. It's a very, very long ride up and down this track of life – we travel on with perseverance, and the purest forms of effort bring sudden answer of joy and lifetime happiness... Hurry, hurry and get on board; the light at the end of the track is leaving with or without you.

Peace.
