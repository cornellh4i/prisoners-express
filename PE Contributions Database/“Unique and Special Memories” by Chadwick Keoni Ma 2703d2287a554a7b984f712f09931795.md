**“Unique and Special Memories” by Chadwick Keoni Majamay**

Every whiff of Plumaria flowers and Hibiscus brings sweet memories of warmth, happiness, joy, and family or every Ohana (family) occasions and events with singing, food, Ku’Puna (elders) and all the aunties, cousins, and keki (children) enjoying kailua pig (roast pork), lau lau (fish, pork, and beef wrapped in green edible leaves) and lomi lomi salmon (salmon with chopped tomatoes, onions, and green onions): to every mayday performance in elementary, middle, and high school.

Flowers have always given me comfort, beauty, and memories from heaven that I miss so much in the dungeons I now reside in that are now only distant memories in darkness. There are no flowers here in the desert where my dungeon resides. Instead I fill my dungeon with beauty and memories of the word and its creativity by writing words of beauty and memories that flowers bring one word at a time.
