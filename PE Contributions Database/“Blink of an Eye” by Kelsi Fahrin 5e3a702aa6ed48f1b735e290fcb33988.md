**“Blink of an Eye” by Kelsi Fahrin**

In the blink of an eye, time and perception continues our minds progress and process the world as we know it. “Perpetual motion” all it took to find myself in this place is one life altering moment and a bad decision. But then the realization hit me that being in this cell is a blessing in disguise; because like the lyrics, “Living is easy with eyes closed…misunderstanding all we see…” from The Beatles; I had my eyes closed to what was going on around me. I now ‘see’ that living in the game lifestyle is a fantasy but it becomes our only way of life. One without care or worry for what’s really going on. We hurt ourselves and others; we lose our friends, family, and even our freedom on the outside in our reckless pursuit of happiness. It became a nothing to gain, nothing to lose mentality.

When I came to KCJ and got sentenced to my first term I became relieved. Because now I have the opportunity to change and make myself a better person. Time heals and broken bridges are mended. Yes, we struggle mentally and emotionally but knowing I’m not alone gives me strength. It is possible to find freedom within ourselves within these walls and in the blink of an eye, our reality changes. Reality is based on our perception of how we truly see the world around us.
