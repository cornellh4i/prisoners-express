**“Three Sisters” by Hugh Gossett**

I grew up in a family with four siblings. I was the only brother, teaser and protector of all my sisters. What a ride it has been throughout all these years.

I remember mostly our younger years before we all left the nest striking out on our own. The fishing, camping out or just riding around on country roads with our parents and all of us children piled into the back seat. My sisters would talk of dolls, dresses and whatever a particular girl at school may have done. I would stare out the window reflecting on what monsters might be lurking out there behind the tumbleweeds or mesquite trees. Then one of them would poke and prod me as I was very ticklish and then the rough housing would begin until Daddy would turn around and soundly admonish us to stop.

I taught my sisters how to climb the big locust tree in our backyard. We climbed it so much that all the thorns rubbed off from all our clambering around. They never grew back. Still their favorite game was to chase me down, tackle and tickle me. We would chase one another around the butane tank, sit and watch doodle bugs scooting around backwards and building their funnel traps in the soft soil. We often went down to the railroad tracks a block from our home and look through all the rocks and debris deposited by the boxcars and tankers that rumbled by. We would find pop top aluminum lids that had yet to be pressed onto cans. Bands of metal that had come off crates were our most delightful find because we would break it down and then fold them in half and make a very shrill whistle when blown through.

Our most favorite times were time spent with all of the various families at holidays and reunions. Cousins not seen very often, aunts and uncles doting on how big we had grown from the last time they had seen us. Christmas presents and Grandmothers with their excellent homemade apple pies and ice cream.

I have not seen my sisters for some considerable lengths of time. Twelve then five and now fifteen years. Each time we meet it is sort of like meeting a much older version of my sisters as I assume it was for them seeing me again after so many years apart. There are still the hugs and news and new names to learn. But, mostly, there are my three sisters, still there, albeit wishing for the younger years. The memories we relate bring laughter and they bring tears.

There have been disagreements and wrongs done by us to one another. Some to never be forgiven or forgotten. Trust broken with many attempts in words, not action, to apologize. Never should you think only of yourself. Think of the others, especially the ones you love.

I hope one day in the next few years to join again with my three sisters, talk things over and make amends. And once again be able to laugh with and hug and love my three sisters.

They may not know it but they are in my daily prayers, never forgotten and always loved. I would not trade a single one of them for a brother.
