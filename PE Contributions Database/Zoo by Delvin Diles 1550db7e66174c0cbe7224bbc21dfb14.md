**Zoo By Delvin Diles**

My favorite radio talk show, “The dan Lebatard Show,” does a weekly segment, “Zoo Tuesday” with a zoologist Ron McGill. He fields questions from callers and gives fast-paced, excitable responses from his encyclopedic knowledge of animals. Recently, he ends his segment with a play-by-play of his first time viewing of some viral animal video Dan found. One was bizarre footage of a catfish catching a pigeon on a bank. “Oh, here he comes…you can see his fins above the water...it’s like Jaws ‘Dun-Dun, Dun-Dun’...and this is just an example of how stupid pigeons are. All the other pigeons see him and are flyin’ off, but there’s always one of tro dumb ones-OOH, THERE HE GOES! HE GOT HIM!” Hilarity on steroids
