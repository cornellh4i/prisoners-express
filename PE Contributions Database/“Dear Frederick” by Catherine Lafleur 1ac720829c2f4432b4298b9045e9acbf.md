**“Dear Frederick” by Catherine Lafleur**

Dear Frederick,

Have you noticed that on days when there is a chicken dinner or special meal that your tag swipes in the Computerized Inmate Meal Service Database show that you have already eaten your meal?

You see, Frederick, often our scanner at Camp Prisoney Land is out of service and the officer must hand type my Department of Corrections number into the system. Your number differs by one digit from my own.

Sadly, I must admit that my friends and I have eaten many times on your tag number. I hope this hasn’t caused you too much trouble. Although, it probably has on Thanksgiving, Christmas, the Fourth of July, and every weekly chicken day...for the past five years. Well, sometimes we ate your eggs, biscuits, and turkey sandwiches too.

I’ve thought about you a few years, when my shriveled conscience gasps aloud. However, this is not as often as it should be, considering my religious convictions.

I’d just like to take this opportunity to apologize and let you know that you should write a grievance that the Meal Database shows that you are eating meals at a women’s prison in Southern Florida. (You lucky dog)

In the future, I hope I can refrain from using your number to double dip.

Don’t count me on it though. That chicken is really, really good with the ranch dressing.

Cordially,

Catherine
