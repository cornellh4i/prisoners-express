**“Not Another Poem About Wolves” by Chad Frank**

I refuse to write another poem

About running with a pack,

Kindred spirits and all of that.

And I refuse to write another poem

About being a lone wolf,

Howling at the moon.

Because these metaphors

Are so cliche.

But wait … I guess I just did.
