**"My Cell" by Darnell Page**

It’s not very often I get to share with others a picture of my current living conditions. If at any point you feel pain in your heart and wish to shed a tear, just know I’ve felt the same way for the last 14 ½ years. You see that concrete cube in the middle of the picture? That’s my cell. Should you ever feel the urge to visit me just know I don’t have any furniture. The only place to sit is on the toilet, a steel bunk, or the concrete floor. Still, want to visit? The only beverages I have to offer is your choice between tepid water and hot water. It only gets cold in the winter. Still, want to visit?

I get fed three times a day but I can’t tell you when exactly since each day is at a different time. I have to warn you now that it won’t be enough to share, nor will it be enough to get full. In fact, after you eat, you will be hungrier than before you ate. Of course, I don’t mind giving you the entire tray since I’m used to going to bed hungry; been doing it for 14 ½ years now. Still, want to visit? They have starvation down to science around here.

That is not an actual lake surrounding my cell. Somebody down the run is flooding their cell because a guard refused to feed him. Been there done that. Still, want to visit? The trees in the back of my cell are the only real view I have of the outside world. Been that way for the last 14 ½ years. Still, want to visit? All those birds you see in the background are not really birds. Some of them are golden opportunities that I let slip through my fingers; the rest are my ideas and mind running wild from being cooped up in my cell twenty-three hours a day. Funny how birds of a feather flock together if you catch my drift. Still, want to visit?

To be honest with you, you really caught me at a bad time. A guard was just killed the other day, another was beaten; they found four cell phones which are contraband, and an ounce of crystal meth. Needless to say, we will be on 24 hour lockdown for the next thirty to ninety days. Prison administration is mad at us, so we only get one sandwich a meal and a handful of prunes to help flush it out our system quicker. Told you they have starvation down to a science. Thought I was exaggerating? I guess that’s what you get for living in my cell.
