**“Couple at a Table” by Efren Hawkins**

I remember a wonderful night in a bar that once changed my life. I discovered the true effect of music. The singer had my friend forgetting I was there. It was like my friend was taken outside of her body. I could only sit there and sip on my drink, as I sat there seeing my friend enjoy herself. I wondered if I was gonna ride home alone.

When we got in the car, she scared me when she touched my ear. While I was driving I thought of an R Kelly song and started singing it. Boy, I’ll never forget that night. We talked for hours and just reflected on life’s ups and downs. As we talked, I expressed that I didn't know music affects people like that. She replied that it took her to another world and took away all the stress and frustration of daily life.

On another occasion with another friend, when she came home, I sang “ Suddenly” by Billy Ocean. While she was at work, I realized how I was enjoying life with her. I was like the song says, “ You wake up and suddenly, you’re in love.”

I met another friend and she had a song that I sang everyday in my heart. She passed away while we were young and I think of her everyday. It’s the song by Stephanie Mills and Teddy Pendergrass, “Feel Me.” That was our song even though we were young and enjoying life. Yeah, I truly enjoy old school music. Each time I think about the song “Feel Me”, I see the blessing of life, because I gave up about 30 years ago. The Lord still has me living and singing this song and that song. So, I’ll keep on singing till I can’t sing anymore.
