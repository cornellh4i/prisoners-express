**Nature’s Medicine by Leo Cardez**

In prison, our days are spent bathed in fluorescent lighting, staring at four walls. Prisons are iron and concrete human warehouses. Prison’s negative effects on the human condition are unquantifiable - nothing more so than the separation from nature itself.

The science is compelling and undeniable. Humans need time with and in nature. Our connection to nature, built over eons, is crucial to our mental and physical wellbeing. Researchers can begin to see positive effects in as little as five minutes: our heart rate slows, facial muscles start to relax, hard-working frontal lobes begin to quiet down. The benefits of time spent in nature seem endless: increased generosity, boosting memory, lowering stress, decreasing blood pressure, enhancing focus, improved creative problem solving; reducing inflammation, anxiety, and depression, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true: lack of connection with nature exacerbates potential issues and causes overall damage to our health. It is clear the inmate's almost complete disconnection from the natural world is another inhumane consequence of our country’s broken criminal justice system. We came to prison as punishment, not for punishment.

As inmates, we must be diligent in our own self care; do what we can even with our limited resources. Firstly, we must take every opportunity to go outside whenever possible - every yard, every walk to chow, etc … Once outside, focus on any greenery available. If all else fails, look up to the sky and see the sun, stars, and moon. Breathe it all in. But, COVID - related quarantines and lockdowns may make this impossible - now we have to get creative.

There is new research that has shown placebo - like effects from watching nature programming (National Geographic, Discovery, etc.) and looking at photos of nature from magazines. The key is to try to engage in it mentally. Meditate on it. Lose yourself in it for at least a few minutes every day. It may seem silly, but your health depends on it.

Don’t give up. These walls carry dark magic capable of taking so much from a man. We have already lost so much. We must refuse to allow ourselves to lose any more. Good luck.
