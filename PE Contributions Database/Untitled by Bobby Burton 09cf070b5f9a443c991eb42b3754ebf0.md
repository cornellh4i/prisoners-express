****Now I see the mountains, and I just would enjoy climbing them. I see myself walking through these large rocks. As I look up to the sky, I see nothing but white clouds, and I can feel the heat from the sun.

I start to feel the humidity and sun rays, and so I take out a Gatorade to replenish from walking through all the rocks. I don’t finish until I reach the top. I put the Gatorade back in my backpack and take out my gravel catcher and rope, an I throw it up to where I’m trying to go. I know this is going to be a challenge, and so I throw it up between the rocks, and I begin to climb, pulling on the tope.

Now, I’m about to be at my destination, and I’m energized from the Gatorade. I struggle a little, but I make it to my destination. This is all I had to accomplish today. Thank you for your time.
