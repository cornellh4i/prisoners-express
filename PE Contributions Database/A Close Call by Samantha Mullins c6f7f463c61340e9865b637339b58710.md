**A Close Call by Samantha Mullins**

In the end she’ll survive.

She sent out her S.O.S like the captain

Of a sinking ship would do.

Yea, that's pretty accurate.

Most- If not all -thought it was too late and

She couldn't blame them.

It was that dreadful night

That saved her life but

It wasn't exactly the way she always

Imagined she’d be “saved”.

See, she was expecting some kind of

Cure

Or a

“Quick Fix”

Ironically, that's always been her problem.

That quick fix.

Instead she got yellow lines, recalls and the

Very best of all

Barbed wire fences.

Don't misconstrue, she doesn't assign the

Blame but, it all started when her family

Wanted

Perfection.

She just wanted

Freedom

The freedom to be herself.

Then, she got tired.

She got tired of juggling who she was

With who others wanted her to be.

She was too ignorant to realize that

Even though they expected too much.

They still only wanted the best.

The best for her.

She searched for comfort and escape

And found it.

In the tiniest thing and

Once she broke it down they became equal

Because she too,

Was broken down.

After each line she got further and further

Away until inevitably she was

Asleep.

Then eventually shed awaken and then

Suddenly

She’s back

Great. She’s back

Then the process of the journey to oblivion starts

Again.

Snort. Repeat. Snort. Repeat.

But again she got tired.

Only this time, she was tired of being alone.

The only thing that never left her was her hollowed out pen.

Or maybe that's the only thing she never left.

But now it's time to part.

And this time she’s back by choice.

She has won a few battles but

She wants to stay alive

To win the war

Bridges have been rebuilt and that's a huge

Feat but

The biggest feat of all;

She’s better.

Me.

I might have been dead on the inside,

Dead for too long to admit,

But I came up for air, took a deep, satisfying

Breath and

It was a definite close call but,

In the end …

I survived.
