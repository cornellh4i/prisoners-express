When were the old days? And what determines when they were? Is it a muscle car at a drive-in theater, a classic 4-8-4 steam engine hauling a long passenger train through the mountains, or a 1954 open cab American Lafrance screaming through a small town as three firemen ride the rear bumper, hanging on for dear life, their knuckles white? Was it going to the soda shoppe and a sock hop? Or maybe sneaking into the Big Red Barn on Saturday night to go square dancing? Maybe it was walking five miles to school - uphill both ways. Or the 2x4 with roller skate wheels you had as a skateboard.

Maybe it’s sitting around the old farmhouse front porch while the neighbor’s family jug band plays out their memories. Or the days when you could take a weekend trip and come home to your still unlocked home.

Being born in the late 1980s, my “old days” would have been the 1990s and early to mid 2000s. We could play in any of our neighbor’s yards and walk right in to visit with no threat perceived. We got our butts kicked for crossing the avenue or being close to the river. When you acted like a dolt, you were reminded of your behaviors, and your mom let the neighbor yell at you, or do what he thought was right.

Maybe we all just need to go back to the era of muscle cars and drive-ins.
