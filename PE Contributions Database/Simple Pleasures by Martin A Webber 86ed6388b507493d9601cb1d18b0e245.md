**"Simple Pleasures" by Martin A. Webber**

A simple term like "simple pleasures" could be a hard term to define given our alternate point of view. To someone in a "normal" situation in life, simple pleasures could be the time spent with your child, of watching him or her grow into their own lives--or the love you see in your mother's eyes--or sharing the warmth of your spouse as you curl up together to go to sleep--a good meal--a laugh shared with friends--all simple, all filled with pleasure...all easily taken for granted by those who are lucky enough to experience them on a daily basis.

Take a little advice from an idiot who's learned the hard way--instead of overlooking the small things we enjoy in life as insignificant...accept them as the gifts that they are. Savor them--for without them, you may still be alive, 9another debatable point, to be sure) but you're far from living.
