**"Island" by Calvin Clarke**

Eleven days. Eleven days I’ve spent clinging to this makeshift raft made of flotsam, clinging to life with everything I have. Madness set in about seven days ago, that is if madness can be defined by a common midshipman washed overboard by a rogue wave. I know that they are out there looking for me since protocol dictates bed checks every six hours. But where do you begin a search when that which is lost is but a drop within trillions of gallons amassing into a vast abyssal ocean?

I saw the first tentacle seven days ago. It reached out from beneath the waves, towering twenty meters or so above the surface. It was seeking me out as if it could smell my fear or sense my terror. Frantic kicks upon the water, propelling me up this dark water even further from my rescue as I sapped my strength and bile rose into my throat. This is all that I can do against this massive appendage.

Twice more, over the past few days, this giant tree-trunk-thick tentacle breeches the salty water as if it was seeking me out. My dry mouth contains the scream that would escape if it had but a bit of moisture to allow it. I once again kick frantically to create distance, but distance from what exactly? Closing my sunburned eyes, I pray to the gods to allow me to live, to keep me safe from this abhorrent child of Neptune. I wonder at its origin. Could it be a giant squid or the feared Kraken of Norwegian legend? Why would something so massive seek out one as insubstantial, as insignificant, as myself?

I don’t see signs of the creature this last day. The water is calm and silent when I wake as if from some nightmare born in the sunken city of R'lyeh. My mind is lost to madness as my body is tormented by hunger and thirst.

Sounds of sea murmurs and terns rouse me from this morning stupor. I at first believe them to be hallucinations, or possibly decoys hanging from gossamer threads. Rubbing my eyes in exasperation I realize there are hundreds of these nutritious birds flying about an island impossibly drifting atop this unending sea of indifference.

Kicking like a hungered madman, which in both cases I can attest to its truth, I slowly make my way to the shore and find a small waterfall coming from within, its source a mystery but the freshness of its emission a bane to this tired soul.

The birds screech their hatred as they fly above me encircling two enormous trees standing not unlike guards upon this impossible manifestation of an island. How could they row so majestic in a place this barren? What nutrients feeds their roots?

Stone structures completely cover the surface. A maze of concretions covered in some unknown script and stairways leading nowhere. Atop the island sits a small building carved it seems from a single piece of cyclopean stone. A doorway within the stone beckons me like a magnet does metal. Blackness resides beyond this doorway. A blackness so deep, the nothingness hurts my eyes after so many days of staring at the evil sun.

My legs barely support my withered body as my malnourishment is so severe. The water that once supported me now drips helplessly from my tattered clothes. I think I feel a vibration emanating from deep within the island. My stomach lurches, allowing me to taste the bile once again of an unknown terror. I grab ahold of one of the trees as the entire island begins to rise higher above the ocean until I witness what cannot be true. The one god I had forgotten in my pleas of mercy has found me once again.

Modern instructors at the famous Miskatonic University have catalogued all of the Great Old Ones and now I find myself riding upon the back of the great forgotten god, Dagon, himself. His trap set out for me alone gives me a sense of belonging. He did this all for me. I am something special in his many eyes.

I cannot kick myself away from the tentacle this time, for I am upon land, upon Dagon, and with my final breath I see not just one giant tentacle, but hundreds. Each one taking a small piece of me with it.
