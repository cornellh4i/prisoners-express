We all face dangerous situations in life. Sometimes it can come upon our finances, relationships while other times upon our existence. Finances and relationships can be repaired, but we only have one life to live. Once it’s lost, it’s lost forever.

I was rescued from a life and death situation when I was 10 years old. A small river passed half a mile away through our neighborhood. It was raining, and the river had reached a dangerous level and was overflowing. I went to see this phenomenon with my buddies. They told me it was going to be very exciting because the flood was gonna bring a lot of booty. We all went excited. I had never witnessed such an event.

I was excited to see all that water. I went to the edge to catch some booty. I didn’t know how to swim. Suddenly, The current of the water was too strong. I thought I was gonna be carried away and drowned. Thankfully, my uncle came to my rescue. He threw his umbrella towards me. I grabbed it and eventually came out of the river. My uncle saved my life. He rescued me. I learned the biggest lesson in my life: not to play with water anymore.
