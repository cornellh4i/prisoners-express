**“Double Take” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

Jack had a wonderful time at the auto show. There were antique Fords, classic Mustangs and Stingrays, across the aisle from Rolls-Royces. Lamborghinis, a Maserati, and other foreign cars. He would have liked to have spent more time in the truck area, and there were even some motorcycles there, but Diane wasn’t interested in them at all. It had actually been advertised as a car and boat show but there were only four boats in one corner. He and Diane had spent almost an hour there though. He imagined what she would look like in the cockpit in a bikini and a wet tshirt. One of the salespeople had a nice body too - not as pretty in the face but an even bigger, rounder ass.

He liked being seen in public with Diane. She was beautiful, smart, talented and short. Yes, short, so she made him look much taller than he really was.

On the way home, when they were almost at the subway station, they passed a young woman walking in the opposite direction who looked a lot like Diane. Of course, he had to look.

Diane was bored. Why do boys always want to look at things they can’t have? Why couldn’t Jack take her to a nice concert? Oh well, she liked being seen in public with him. He was tall, clean shaven, with no tattoos. His ex-girlfriends said he had a huge cock. Diane had never seen it. She could have peeked a couple times when he was pissing but he never pressed her for sex. She liked that.

A gal passed them going the other way who looked a lot like her, except for her clothes. They clung to her body like paint yet there were no strap lines. Her butt was too big.

Jack was in trouble, whether he realized it or not. If he didn’t look, Diane would wonder why. She might not say anything right away but doubts would linger. If he looked, she’d be jealous. Why are girls so difficult to get along with? In prison, Jack had learned to always check out any female.

He looked. She was phat! He pursed his lips but fought against the urge to whistle.

Diane was furious. She fussed for half an hour, then gave him the cold shoulder.

They had a good laugh the next day, though, when Diane confided that she knew the other woman. She was her ex-girlfriend.
