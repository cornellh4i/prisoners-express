**“Thankful” by Robert S. Visintine**

I woke up and turned on my radio to NPR news. The news reporter was telling of the shooting in the little town of Sutherland Springs, Texas.

My first reaction was of sorrow and the impulsive question of, why would someone do that? I don’t understand. I have just turned 57 years old and, having been in prison for the last 26 years, I wonder what has happened out there? These senseless and cruel mass shootings are becoming so frequent, what has our culture evolved into?

What happened to the culture of hope and progressive change for a better life for everyone that marked my childhood in the 60’s? It seems to me, our culture of today embraces hate, division, and violence. A culture where human life has lost its value.

I don’t have much contact to the free world, so I don’t know, but this seems to be the culture the media bombards us with. As a writer myself, I understand sex, violence and controversy is what sells in America, a multi-billion dollar industry we’re addicted to.

A commercialized culture of labeling everyone into one divisive group or another, making everyone different than ourselves and desensitizing our innate human empathy for one another, as if it’s alright to hate and be violent to others if they are not in our group or are labeled something other than us.

As the sadness started to overwhelm my thoughts, I thought, “I’m thankful my children survived without me.” And I realized then, it was this power of being thankful which was missing. I never hear of news we are thankful for.

What has preserved my mind and heart during these long and lonely years has been periodically writing down all I’m thankful for. It is easy to make complaining, hatefulness and criticizing everyone and everything a habitual topic of our thoughts and speech.

After I was told I had fatal cancer 3 years ago, I discovered the power of being thankful. It heals our heart, mind and soul. When we list what we are thankful for, it changes our perspective on life. When we think of all there is to be thankful for, life, at this moment, doesn’t seem so bad.

When my mind is thinking on what I’m thankful for, I begin to feel happy and I begin to feel loved and this is something no one can take from me or not give me or hold back from me. I possess this power in each and every moment in all its fullness. Words cannot express how thankful I am for this power which is always with me at all times.

I can be thankful at anytime and all the time. No one can stop me. It doesn’t matter where I’m at. A superpower to call upon, which instantly appears to save the day. Because I’m thankful, my whole reality changes and nature responds by creating more reasons to be thankful for.

Imagine if our culture embraced thankfulness, would it change people? Maybe it would cure these poor souls whom have lost all hope and thankfulness to commit such desperate acts.

Thankfully, we can all use this power and seed it into our culture for real change to create better tomorrows. If thankfulness is a superhero, it’s sidekick is a smile. With those two, we can, “create nice days, make lots of smiles.”
