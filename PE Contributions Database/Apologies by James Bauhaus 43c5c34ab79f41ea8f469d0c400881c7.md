**“Apologies” by James Bauhaus**

I sincerely apologize to the rest of the world for letting our sleazy politicians cheat us out of Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton and instead saddle us with another Republican-Conservative buffoon like Trump. Sonny Bush was bad enough, but Trump is an even bigger puppet and co-criminal of the world’s worst super-rich.

I want to specifically apologize for letting Trump bring so much of his swamp to the even bigger crocodile-infested swamp of Washington, D.C. There is no excuse for the American people allowing the millionaires and billionaires and corporations to eat us alive, then rob the entire world of its riches and resources.

I apologize for the greedy rich, who can never get enough for themselves, and who, all the while they are gathering their lucre, cast jealous, angry glances at the women and their infants who must try to survive on subsidized staples.

For the obscenely rich, I offer; “Who we listen to marks what we hear. Where we stand marks what we see. What we do marks who we are.” Robert McAfee Brown 1920 ~ 2001
