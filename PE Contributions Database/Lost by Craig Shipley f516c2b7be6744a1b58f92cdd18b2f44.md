**by Craig Shipley**

When people I write do not respond, I get all kinds of ideas in my head, especially when those people are my friends and family back in my home state of North Carolina.

Many times I think that I have been forgotten or that people just don’t care or have the time for me. I tend to jump to the worst conclusions.

A few weeks ago, my Mama told me that someone I write to often talked to her. This person asked how I am and that she had been getting my letters. Mama told me that she’s gotten busy with life and forgot to write, but she does love me and I am in her thoughts and prayers.

I am not lost! Thank the Lord that I am still remembered after so many years away from home. In prison, it is wonderful to know you are thought of and not lost or forgotten.
