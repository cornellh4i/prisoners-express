**In Extremis by LeRoy Sodorff**

Even though she had his number years ago, she was just too distant to make that call. That was until she had the audacity to turn up here today. In a face-saving move and putting up a brave front, this doe-eyed beauty gives eye to the hole in the wall and beyond.

In a twilight sleep, a tight-lipped, beetle-browed, hollow-cheeked, sunken-eyed sexagenarion (once an eyeful in his prime) lies in his deathbed draped in white. While there in the twilight zone, he senses the sudden Apparition of a dainty, white color, bluestocking, well-heeled skirt at his bedside. She has an air of dignity about her that he doesn’t quite comprehend. She is a cosmopolitan woman in vogue. Then, in that “Aha” moment, he pursed his lips and … Though his final words are faint, he murmurs “I am sorry, my darling sweetheart.”

Somewhere off in the distant an angelic voice whispers “I forgive you daddy.”

Though she arrived in a conquest, she leaves in a Dodge on the other side of the wall.

P.S. Giving credit where credit is due: I didn’t write these words. It’s just that … I’m in the pen and it takes a “Mighty Hand” to move me.
