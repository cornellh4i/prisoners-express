**Zoo by Shannon Guess Richardson**

Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my! I see the most interesting animals with my little eye!

I see hyenas who laugh so widely and loudly, they always attract attention. I see orangutans who hang from everything in sight without a care in the world about falling. I see giraffes who like to stick their long necks out where they usually don't belong. I see meerkat who always pop up at the worst times. Where do those pets even come from?! I see bats who are delirious and are truly “batshit crazy”. I see peacocks who flaunt and showboat for their potential lovers. I see hippos who eat everything in sight, creating their fabulous figures. I see bears who snore and growl at the worst times–usually when others are sleeping (or trying to). I see kangaroos with pouches so deep they can fit just about anything in there they need to. I see turtles who only pop out of their little shells when it suits their needs. I see elephants with a tendency to remember absolutely everything–about the wrong things that got them put in here in the first place. I see tigers who are ferocious, they come after anything and anyone in their path. Watch out for those claws! I see zebras who bray about anything and everything. I see lions who think they are the king and run everything.

Wow! Prison is a wild place! Oh wait, did you actually think I was talking about the zoo?
