**“Writing My Wrongs” by Leo Cardez**

There is nothing exactly like living in Hell, but there is something close to it. In Hell, where I lived for most of 2013 and 2014, there is, as Dante understood, no hope. You wake up every morning realizing your nightmare will continue into your waking hours. The loss you have suffered is permanent. Life will never be the same. There is no healing, no improvement, but even more important, there is no possibility of any to come. The most unbearable thing about your unbearable life is that you will always be forced to bear it.

In the midst of my horrific incarceration experience, alone, desperate to save my relationships with my loved ones and failing, I occasionally wondered if those who hate me or blame me were watching somehow so they might find my misery enjoyable. I might have -- if I believed everything that was said about me. And on a number of particularly dark evenings, I considered doing just that. I doubted anyone could hate me more than I hated myself. I couldn’t bear to look at my own reflection.

And then I started writing and journaling. I wrote about everything and nothing: everyday tidbits, thoughts, hypes, goals, complaints, updates -- whatever popped into my head my only rule was raw honesty. I figured if this writing is to mean anything it must all be true. I didn’t realize honest writing will tear your guts out. Like when I saw the pain and shame in my mother’s eyes when she came to visit me -- knowing it was my fault, and worse, I could do nothing to help her. That feeling of helplessness was like being stuck in a barrel at the bottom of the ocean -- there is nothing worse. But, still I wrote. I wrote by the light of the morning sun or glare of my small T.V. I promised myself I would make no excuses -- I would find a way to write something every day. And I have. And now, 5 years later I’ve learned one important lesson: things change.

My father once told me, “The universe smiles on a persistent heart, so never stop trying to make a better life for yourself”.

As I reread my earliest journal entries, I marvel at the hilariously flawed, petty, silly, unhappy person I was. I also noticed that when I did my best to make things better -- every now and then -- I would succeed… eventually. As I look around today I see a better life with a job, school, good housing unit, great cellmate, and even better food, not to mention the healthiest I’ve felt since my early 20’s. Writing has helped me see and appreciate my life in a whole new light.

See, writing was for me not a diversion. It was my church, because it offered salvation in the promise of change. Escaping Hell is difficult, because sometimes there are too many people who enjoy seeing you there. But with enough effort, once grace, and pens and paper, it can be done. When my parents wrote to tell me they were proud of me on my 40th birthday card, I wept. And I wept again after my niece’s and sister’s visit -- seeing them grown, changed, and beautiful from the inside out -- having found what they had been searching for (though not in the place they had been looking).

Writing, and specifically journaling, has taught me how to look forward once again to the next chapter and, finally, to my own life.
