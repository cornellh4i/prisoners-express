**“We Are Not Alone” by Richard Sean Gross**

There are 100 billion stars in our galaxy and who knows how many throughout the universe. In recent years, astronomers have discovered hundreds of planets around nearby stars. Our solar system has nine planets. If we assume an average of 5 planets per star, then the Milky Way galaxy would contain 500 billion planets. This is a conservative estimate: it would be a trillion!

With such a staggering number of planets, it is clearly possible, maybe probable, that some have life on them. Earth is in the temperate zone where liquid water exists. Yet life on Earth exists even in the most hostile places on our planet: frozen tundra, deserts, deep ocean trenches, pitch dark caves, and on the edges of volcanoes. Life is hardy and adaptable.

Scientists have proven that “life as we know it” can only exist in some rather unlikely circumstances. This key phrase reminds us that life on Earth has evolved within the parameters that exist here. Life elsewhere in the galaxy has likely evolved within the parameters that exist on other planets. It may not be “life as we know it;” it could be life we don’t even recognize or understand.

The idea of intelligent life on other planets is not that preposterous. The idea that we are the most intelligent creatures in the universe is pompous. The universe is far older than our planet, and the planet is far older than human beings. Our civilization is only 10,000 years old, and that is nothing compared to a 16 billion year old universe. There could be civilizations out there that are millions of years old and much further advanced than us. The more I think about it, the less it seems a leap of faith and more a reality not yet proven.
