**Stars by Eric Whisnat**

So many things cross my mind when I think of the word “stars.” Immediately coming to mind are big, powerful, beautiful things, but the most beautiful moment that comes to mind is a time from when I was in love for the first time: puppy love.

It was the fall or wintertime, and I was 15 years old. I picked up my girlfriend who I was head over heels for, and I wanted that night to be special without cops or any drama. That was hard to avoid being a wanted man by police and in a stolen car. I’ll never forget: it was cold outside, and I didn’t have anywhere to take her for us to be alone. I drove out of the city toward the foothills where I knew of a clearing in the trees. Once we drove out there and parked, we smoked a couple blunts and talked. We ate our food, turned the music up, and danced, enjoying the night. We truly enjoyed each other’s company! At one point, Victoria told me that she was cold, and I got an idea after seeing the stars and moon shining so bright.

I got a blanket from the car, put some slow jamz on, and told her to climb up on the hood. After she was up there, I climbed up as well.

With the heat coming from under the hood, we curled up in each other’s arms to watch the stars and talk about where we thought our lives were going. It was a very real, heart to heart conversation, and it was one of the most beautiful and unforgettable moments I ever had.

While talking and holding each other, we both spotted a shooting star. We agreed on how cool and beautiful it was, and at that moment, I looked into her eyes and said that I wanted to always be her shooting star. She looked so sad when she looked into my eyes and said, “You definitely shine bright above all the others, and you are cool. This very moment I’ll never forget how perfect and beautiful it is, but baby, shooting stars only last for a second then they are gone forever!”

Oh, how right she was. I was incarcerated the very next day and never saw her again, but I’ll never forget the moment I outshined all the other stars--even if it was only for a second! Damn!
