**“The Small Things” by Alton Chavis**

This couldn’t be right. Rebecca heard what sounded like the familiar shouts of a preteen, heading her way. “Mom! Skylar used my iPad!” There it was again. She peered from beneath her rising eyelids, hoping that the image of her son at the door was just a mirage. Tyler came completely into her bedroom, pulled open the thick grey drapes, and stood in the glaring sunlight.

“She’s not supposed to be in my room Mom!” Tyler crossed his arms, wanting retribution. It didn’t matter to him that his mother had just worked a double shift at the hospital. Rebecca somehow found the strength to stumble out of her pillowy paradise. She threw on a tattered robe, and rainbow-colored toe socks. Then she sleepily followed Tyler downstairs, to an impromptu family court hearing.

The “proceedings” lasted well over two hours. There was a long break midway, so that Rebecca could fix lunch for the plaintiff and defendant. After both parties had reached a feasible personal property and boundary agreement, Rebecca sauntered back up to her humble bedroom haven, She slithered beneath her comforter, and sleep swept her over like a warm foamy wave.

Two hours and three minutes later, it was Skylar’s turn to crash the slumber party. She startled Rebecca out of her late nap, with a running stage dive onto her mattress. “Moooom! I need some more stuff for my science project, and Ty needs more Pop Tarts and Hot Pockets! We’ll be in the car!” Skylar bounced off of the bed, and back down the stairs.

Rebecca yawned and stretched away the mild heart attack her daughter may or may not have just given her. She pulled on some mismatch sweats over her pajamas, put her hair back into something resembling a ponytail, and slipped into some highlighter yellow crocs. She was the walking dead, all the way to her petrified fossil of a minivan.

Of course, a trip to the craft store became a trip to the mall. Then, a trip to the grocery store (with a brief trip to the wine section for Rebecca!). Then a trip to the gas station, and the adjoining car wash. It was a four hour trip in total. Rebecca was guided back home by a fading sun. By the time she had finished washing the after dinner dishes, the moon was out patrolling the night skyline.

Rebecca ascended to her refuge of rest on autopilot. She poured herself into her bed’s soft embrace, sweats, and all, began to doze off. There was a soft knock at the door. Rebecca gave a grunted invitation into her cozy lair. Her twins peered in cautiously. They were filled with a guilty sadness, at the sight of their depleted and defeated matriarch.

The twins entered their mother’s room, with an aura of peaceful compassion. Tyler removed Rebecca’s crocs first. Then Skylar released her hair from its elastic bondage. Rebecca retreated her weary head to the fluffy solace of her pillow. The twins raised her comforter up, and wafted back down over her.

There was a gentle kidd from Tyler to Rebecca’s cheek, and one from Skylar to her forehead. The twins tiptoed their way out of her nocturnal nest, and lightly closed the door behind them, A loving smile emerged through Rebecca’s exhausted features. She had one last thought, before she dissolved into a distant dream. “Thank you God, for my family.”
