***Contact* by Steven P. Arthur**

On a remote farm just south of Topeka, Kansas, Jared Blankenship was feeding his dairy cows when he noticed, in the sky, the first of many odd occurrences that were to come.

“What the hell are they doin’,” Jared asked, one hand tucked in his overalls, and the other pointing into the sky.

Beyond his arthritic pointed finger, high in the sky, a murder of crows flew in a figure eight pattern.

“I reckon they lost their bearin’s; never seen ’em do that,” said Jannie with her hand shading her big blue eyes. Her flower print dress was tinted a deep orange by the dusk light and flapped in the light breeze by the flat prairie lands. “Come on, Jared. Let’s get inside. I don’t like the look of that.”

At the expected speed of octogenarians, they moved toward the two-bedroom farm home that they had both occupied for nearly five decades.

After walking around the house to ensure all of the storm windows were properly closed, Jannie went into the spartan living room. Devoid of the most common of furniture and family photos, the only exception to amenities was where she found Jared, sitting in his over-stuffed recliner. Despite the plentiful space, an aging TV with a very modern satellite attachment which afforded them 200 premium channels from around the world sat in front of him, nearly touching his knees.

Jared sat motionless with the TV remote in his outstretched hand, pointed at the news channel that repeatedly showed a short, amateur video of wild geese flying in a perfect circle across the screen.

“Well, would you look at that,” he said.

“What’d reckon it means?” she asked.

“Dear, it could be a sign of the times.” He turned to look at her. “We knew it would come without warning.”

“Come on then, husband. Let’s go downstairs.” She kicked off her shoes and began to move toward the kitchen. He followed close behind, just in time to see her easily slide the kitchen table into the corner. Underneath was a small hole with a latch that she depressed. It popped back up, and she pulled it to her. The square door opened quietly on hidden hinges. She stood back.

“You first, husband. I will seal it behind us.”

He moved over to the door that had covered a stairwell leading down into the darkness. WIth familiarity and the dexterity of a much younger man, Jared climbed down. She followed close behind, sealing the door.

When she was halfway down, bright lights flickered on, but she expected them and didn’t so much as pause in her descent 20 feet below. When her bare foot touched down on the cold metal floor, there was no sound. She looked around at the monitors, control panels and multi-colored switches that covered 3 walls. Jared was turning on the panel in front of him. He turned to her with a look of excitement and began to undress. He hastily stripped his clothes off while his loose, weathered skin simultaneously began to draw tight. The wisp of white hair on his head came off with a swipe of his hand as easily as wiping off water. With his clothes off, he stood in front of her, his arms up as if putting himself on display. His skin was smooth, tight, and ashen grey, and he had no visible genitalia. His head, much larger than it should have been for his body size, was set above two large, slanted, ebony orbs.

“I like this look much better,” she said, having removed her clothing as well. SHe appeared just as he did, with no distinguishing features to tell them apart, except the ice blue contact lenses that she was removing.

After Jared sat and stared at the console, he began moving levers and typing; his arthritic hands were gone and replaced with three thick fingers that moved swiftly over the keyboard. “I’ll let them know we are ready for contact.”
