**Cave of my Victimhood by Travis Welsh**

To gain knowledge, one must be a rebel. Wisdom and goodness in a singular person, without blemish, is an improbable mixture. Many of us feel like they are stuck in a cave void of truth, an engineered deprivation tank. Yet, some of these people assimilate quite readily and seem to be just, secure, happy, and free when in fact are tricked by the worst kind of lie imaginable; the lies we tell ourselves, such as, “don’t rock the boat, just go along to get along.”

I know this from personal experience. I don’t really know despair from joy, but this cave did not seem a place of despair so much as full of lies and conductive to lies. I believed I was just a victim and perpetuated that lie onto those around me. I was really good at creating victims who then became victimizers themselves. I preferred to receive abuse rather than face the possibility of being ignored or abandoned.

Throughout incarceration, I have found a semblance of a life in a place where despair flourishes.

I’ve not experienced the bliss of ignorance nor a care-free childhood. I was acutely aware of my status as une bête noire, French form of our “black sheep.” My grandparents blamed me for my dad dying on my mom and repeatedly reminded me that I was just like him. His only “crime” was that he rescued my mom from her incestous dad, my grandfather. My grandparents' guilt and resentment became my burden. I was slow developmentally due to Aspergers and lead poisoning so I had constant issues at every turn.

Privately I began to loathe myself. This led to self-destructive behaviors. I could not find clarity, foresight; or will-power. I became a “poster-child” of victimhood, seemingly a fixture within this cave or den of shadows.

Plato presented a similar image in his book *The Republic,* of people chained in a cave of shadows filled with disconnected echoes. This underground den is not about despair but an allegory of our ignorance of higher thought and the lack of ascension. He calls this place “the fourth perception of shadows.” To my thinking, perception indicates perspective while perspective suggests position and CHOICE.

So maybe I was stuck, by my own choice, in an underground den of a fourth perception. I did not show the motivation to change my position and subsequently this lack of mobility was intrinsic to my poor perspective. I could not perceive that my life had a higher purpose (outside of martyrdoom) or even a worthy legacy.

I am still within the mouth of my cave. The rebel in me sought unchaining and I’m blinking before the sudden brightness, trying to adjust my vision towards a higher perception. I do not pretend to know my destination nor my time-schedule. What I do know is that I have every excuse and right to wallow in an evil state or vindictive nature, but I possess a deep yearn to shed and even avoid the snares of victimhood.

I have glimpses of cognition that my body is a cage and the intrigues of base emotions are an infatuation and sidetrack away from the truest reality. I look forward to exploring this upper-world as it becomes more than mere glimpses. I am one of the lucky ones. Within every horrible experience, I received miracles; strength and endurance as I reached my limits, people suddenly arrived to rescue or sponsor me when dire ends seemed apparent, and forgotten prayers answered. Here I stand, a little good, a bit bad, but nonetheless wiser for the wear and tear. I shall explore the forest of the trees.
