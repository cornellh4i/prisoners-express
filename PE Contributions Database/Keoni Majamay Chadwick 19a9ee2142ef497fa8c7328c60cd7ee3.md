It is one of those things you regret as a kid - homework! It is enough that you already have tons of work to do at school! In my English composition workshop class, we were to write a short story focusing on character development. We had to create an original character and introduce it in a short story.

My character? Mr. Laugh-a-Lot! Every fourth word said or heard by Mr. Laugh-a-Lot? He would break out in laughter! If you said, "Thank you" to him, he would say, "You're welcome." However if you said to Mr. Laugh-a-Lot, "Thank you very much." He would simply laugh in your face.

Mr. Laugh-a-Lot, what a predicament! Most of the time, he would wear ear plugs and pretend to be deaf. As such, the story starts with him taking sign language classes at the local community college, and then ends with him meeting the girl of his dreams and getting married to â€¦ Mrs. Laugh-a-Lot with the same genetic disorder!
