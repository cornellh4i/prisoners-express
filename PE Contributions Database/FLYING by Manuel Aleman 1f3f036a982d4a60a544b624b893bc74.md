**FLYING by Manuel Aleman**

At five years old, I started having out of body experiences. I would take midnight strolls to the park, spot my favorite sewer lid, and take a seat. Then the lid would levitate and take me on an air cruise around my neighborhood. When the flight was over, the lid would return to the same spot and I would have to walk home. If this was a dream, it kept re-occurring for a year and I enjoyed every flight.

At the age of nineteen, I came home from a party and crashed out in my room. I awoke in the middle of the night on the roof and stared at the apartments next door. That night I had been drinking so waking up on the roof didn’t seem so far fetched. I thought I was having a bad trip until I walked back into my room and saw myself sleeping. When I approached the bed, I unwillingly levitated over my body while I tried to scream for help. Then a force slammed me down onto the bed, snapping me back to reality.

Two years later during a similar experience, I had a better understanding of what was happening and decided to test my wings. I flew up from the roof to a light post. Immediately, a lady walked up and started yelling, “Hey come down from there and don’t try that again! Next time you might fly away forever!”

“Fine, then.” I glided from the light post back onto the roof, still feeling tempted to fly.

For many nights thereafter (when upon realizing that I was outside my body), I’d fly around a bit; going no further than a few feet off the ground because I didn’t want to anger my guardian angel.

One night I couldn’t take it anymore. I flew towards the light post again, as I’d done before, but didn’t ring any alarms. I scanned the sky for a few seconds, then busted a ‘Super Man’ throughout the city. Flying felt better than any rollercoaster, or drug, I’d ever been on.

“I told you not to do it!” I heard a female voice screaming inside my head. “Now how are you going to come down?” She was right, I tried to stop but I just kept soaring higher and higher. I started to worry and thought I was going to die. I pictured my mom waking up that morning to find me unresponsive on my bed with my tongue hanging out. “If you have faith you could come down!”

I conjured all the faith inside me, then I had to walk a long way home.

From then on, upon realizing that I was outside my body, I’d try to go back in immediately and wake myself up. But one night I was feeling rebellious. Trying my hardest to fly, I couldn’t make it outside the door. An invisible force was blocking me. On my last attempt, I made progress but something caught me in midair, spun me around and threw me back inside the room. An angry voice yelled at me while attempting to go back inside my body, “You selfish idiot, son of a bitch!” It kept screaming obscenities at me, for a minute, even after I was fully awake. Very scary, very disrespectful.

When I told people about this, they thought I was crazy, but what my dad told me to put everything into perspective. It turned out that when he was young, he was studying how to travel outside of his body. Just like me, one night he went too far and it scared him straight.

My nights started getting worse. I’d try to fly and the spirits would drag into a dark abyss or I’d succeed and manage to land in another world where tortured souls encountered their demons. These were more than nightmares. I was literally going to Hell and back.

Whatever my dad conjured up in the past was haunting me. I guess “the sins of the father” crap is true. So, I prayed even though I’m NOT religious. “Lord, whatever this is, it’s getting out of hand. I didn’t seek it, and if it’s a gift I don’t want it. Please take it away.”

A few nights later, my spirit was soaring through the universe; only this time, I was guided by something divine. I felt safe and was allowed to go anywhere I wanted. “Don’t be afraid,” a voice in my head said.

I dove into the ocean and saw the water molecules break down in slow motion. I went inside a power cable and became one with the energy. Then, I flew past the moon and beyond. When I had enough, I came back without incident.

Till this day, I have NOT had another out of body experience again.
