**"Simple Pleasures" by Barry Williams**

Unfortunately too often individuals that are incarcerated. Like myself, tend not to appreciate life's simple pleasures until they are out of reach. Like spending time with our loved ones, attending a ballgame, or just taking time out to walk around the neighborhood on a spring day. Just to name a few. There is a West-African proverb that says wisdom does not come overnight. We start as a fool and become wise through experience. Let all of us that is or have been incarcerated take the pain and madness of dealing with the criminal justices system and become wise from it. So we can truly value all of the simple pleasures that life has to offer.
