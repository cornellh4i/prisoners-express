**Arguments by Phillip L. Rath**

Arguments seem to be to be 2 or more people, with little or no real knowledge of a given subject, trying to browbeat each other into accepting their point of view.

I've noticed that people with less knowledge of a particular subject tend to use a louder voice to compensate for their obvious lack of pertinent information.

Seldom have I seen an argument produce a positive or productive result. Most likely, arguments result in hard feelings, bruised egos and far too often, violence.

Next time you're on the brink of an ensuing argument, ask yourself if you really want to waste your time & energy in such an inane activity.
