**Nourishment for my soul by Ron Cosner**

My life has been hectic, crazy, and at times unbelievable. I have been labeled, judged, and convicted for loving and caring, for a young girl, who had lied to me about her age. For this I have been punished severely. I was 24 years old and she was 15, though she looked older and had lied to me, apparently this is inexcusable. I guess I am just a fool, and one who fell in love. Though this occurred to me 16 years ago, it still has  major negative effects upon my life, I didn’t even know I was committing a crime!

I did five years in prison for this, and I am labeled for life. Before I was released from prison I had to see a psychologist to determine if “I was too sick to be with society.”  During my time in prison, I began to wonder if I should realize her age on my own. She watched cartoons a lot, but hell I did too. She was developed and looked older right? She had fooled me, but was I truly a pervert? I began to question my own sexuality. I saw the psychologist, and after she read my file and questioned me, I asked her “ma’am am I a sick individual and don’t realize it?” “No, there is nothing abnormal about a young man being attracted to a female, who is fully developed, that is simply normal human nature. You can go home, you do not need to be locked in a mental institution.”

Although this made me feel better about myself, it also seriously made me angry at society for the injustice I had and would endure.

When I got home from prison, I received a telephone call from the girl. She had lied at my sentencing to have her sentence reduced. She lied to me about her age, because she was wanted for drunk driving and crashing. She crashed into a car at an intersection and crippled a man for life. She had run away to avoid being sentenced to juvenile detention center until her 18th birthday. On the phone she asked me to forgive her for lying about me, and she told me I was the first person she had fallen in love with her in her life. I forgave her, though she was hurt emotionally, I had loved her too.

No one would hire me. I could not get a job, because of my sex offender lable. I believe that not being able to support myself financially led me to be depressed, suicidal, and very angry. I robbed a bank in order to do something I intended to do before I committed suicide, but my brother informed the F.B.I of my location. He felt I was going to end my life. I was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison for the bank robbery.

I was angry at society at this point and had a real hatred for people who truly deserved the sex-offender label. I attacked and beat up real child molesters and vowed to be the most expensive prisoner ever! I would cut and throw blood everywhere, stab myself puncturing
