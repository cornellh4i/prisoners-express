**One Grateful Prisoner by Carl Branson**

****Long ago a very wise man (probably my father) commented “gratitude is a matter of attitude,” a nice, pithy platitude with that attractive ring of internal rhyme. The remainder of that tête-à-tête from which this cliché arises is lost amongst the dust-bunnies of memory. Now, however, I have cause to dissect and assess the meaning of this bromide as it relates to my life as a prisoner.

Attitude, in my opinion, is comprised of a variety of components, primarily perception and perceptive. These two factors influence whether optimism or pessimism govern in any given set of circumstances. The doom and gloom inherent to the prison experience, particularly with a lengthy sentence, fosters a pessimistic view on life in general, which is detrimental to the attitude of gratitude.

Like any prisoner worldwide, I detest the destruction of my prior lifestyle and plans for the future. However, I do have examples of prison experiences for which I am grateful. In each case, I was exposed to disciplines I would never have considered as a free man. The three most important experiences relate to the topic of education; both for myself and for others.

Chronologically, the first new horizon for me to explore came through a creative writing adult enrichment program sanctioned by the prison’s education department. Although I had been writing most of my adult life, it was all technical documents: high-level and detailed design specification, operator’s guides, repair manuals, and related technical materials (I was an electronics engineer). The creative writing program was segregated into three distinct curriculums; the first two covered the basics of short story, novella and novel structure. The third covered classical poetry forms including the sonnet, villanelle, sestina, terza rima, and a host of others. As much as I enjoyed the prose forms, particularly the short story, poetry captivated me beyond my wildest imagination. Sadly, much as I enjoy writing poems, I discovered that the muse is a fickle mistress who detests my spending time with other activities, especially my legal treatises.

At least partially as a consequence of my participation in the creative writing programs, I was noticed by an education staff member in need of a replacement Teacher’s Aide (“TA”). Other than helping my own children with homework, I had no background in teaching and was nervous as a whore in a church when I was made responsible for instructing others so they could complete their mandatory literary lesson and GED requirements. Although there were a few bumps along the road for both me and my students, this turned out to be the most gratifying, ego-inflating experience of my life. Watching the sense of pride explode across the faces of my students as they accepted their certificate of completion (mandatory literacy) or their high school equivalency diploma was a thrill every time it happened. A few of those men could not even read when they entered prison. This shared sense of accomplishment with these few surpassed being the Super bowl winner’s quarterback.

In conjunction with my responsibility as a TA I was given the opportunity to formulate and offer a curriculum for a poetry workshop as a part of the adult enrichment program. Again, watching these men explore new horizons, develop inherent skills, or expand on prior knowledge was very rewarding. One student and I shared the joy of having poems published in the same issue of Cell Door Magazine.

As much as I hate prison, I owe a debt of gratitude to two proactive, dedicated staff educators for activating previously unrecognized talents in me. Now, that same sense of gratitude extends to the staff and volunteers at Prisoner Express for providing an outlet for my scribbled mental meanderings.
