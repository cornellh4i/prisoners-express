**“Little Feet Behind Me” by Moses Estrada**

This picture gives me a lot of joy because it reminds me of the future. There is a generation coming after us and what we do will affect their lives. Being able to hold those little feet is the greatest joy among only a few others. If I will be more careful with where I take those little feet today then one day those little feet will go to the right places. Even if I cannot hold those little feet it does not mean that I cannot be involved, because I can. There are ways I stay involved: I pray for those little feet, I write those little feet, I call those little feet, and just as important I do the best I can where I am for those little feet. May God grant me the privilege to once more hold those little feet.
