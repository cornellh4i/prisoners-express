**“Girl Playing Flute” by Chad Frank**

I’d been wandering through the jungle for about a week. I don’t know how long for, since I haven't eaten or drank for nearly as long. I had been traveling with a group of archaeologists in search of a tribe of feral children sightings had been reported, but nobody had had direct contact with one to date.

I’d heard a flute in the distance. Quite an unusual sound considering how the other archeologists and I had only heard bird caws and other wild animals. I followed the sound which led me into the thick. It wasn't long before I got separated from the group and was hopelessly lost. But I remained undeterred and continued my quest. Then suddenly, I saw what appeared to be a child in the distance. Boy or girl I couldn't discern because the child had its back to me. As I got closer I saw that it was wearing a leopard-print singlet and had long blond hair.

The child must have sensed me approaching because it stopped playing the flute and turned toward me. It smiled up at me, exposing a full set of tiny perfect teeth.

The child stood up, then dropped the strap of the leopard-print singlet.

The rest of this report has been nedact.
