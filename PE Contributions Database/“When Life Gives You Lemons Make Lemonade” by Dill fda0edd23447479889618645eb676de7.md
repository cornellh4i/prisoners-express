**“When Life Gives You Lemons Make Lemonade”**

By Dillon Gresham

My grandmother used to always tell me when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. It was her advice throughout my life as I would encounter tough times. She taught me to always find the positive out of the negative. Even throughout the things she didn’t know, I was able to instill her advice and words of wisdom. It helped me survive when she wasn’t around to help, which was quite often. I grew up in foster care going from one foster home to another, from one bad situation to the next. I endured abuse after abuse, mentally, emotionally, physically and even sexually. I have always been a magnet for bad situations. And it’s been hard to find people who understand, because humans are the most ignorant at feeling each other’s pain. So now I ask myself, where is my lemonade? I’m serving a life sentence. I’m alone, no family or friends to help me. I’m ridiculed by other inmates because I’m different. I’m outcasted, because I’m transgender. Where is the lemonade when I’ve been in prison only since December 21st, 2017, and I’ve already been transferred between 5 different prisons. I refuse to take part in the sex games. I don’t indulge just because I’m around men? I’ve already been stabbed, harassed, raped, and jumped. All because of my lifestyle. Where is my Florida Lemonade at? I’m alive, I may be alone, but I’m alive. I’ve still got an appeal looking good in the courts, I’ve got a roof over my head and food to eat. I’m alive. So that’s my lemonade, and I’ve got PE who sends my projects to keep me busy and keeps away the loneliness, but I’m alive. Life has given me lemons, and I’ve made lemonade.
