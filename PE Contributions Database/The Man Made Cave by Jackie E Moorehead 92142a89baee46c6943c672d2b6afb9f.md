**The Man Made Cave by Jackie E Moorehead**

My friend James and I walked up to the adit of a man made cave, AKA an entrance to an abandoned coal mine, that was gouged into the side of a mountain, in southern West Virginia. The coal mine had been abandoned for over 30 years, but there was cool air flowing out of its interior. The mine was a drift mouth coal seam mine.

James and I both had heavy duty flashlights as we entered the mine, and descended down the slight grade passageway, next to the rusty framework of the old conveyor-belt line, into the bowels of the Earth. We walked for about an eighth of a mile and entered a large room that contained a tipple (an apparatus of emptying nine’s coal cars into a large steel hopper that slowly fed the coal onto the conveyor belt line below). The v-shaped hopper was about fifteen feet high, by ten feet wide and thirty feet across the top. On each end there were mine tunnels. The one tunnel had light blue alkaline mine water across it, twelve foot wide abreast, that gradually ascended up the sides of its tunnel, as it went further back into the mountain. But the other tunnel, on the opposite end of the hopper was dry, and the cool flowing air flowed out of it.

There was a steel ladder welded on both ends of the hopper. So we climbed up the ladder, and entered the dry floored tunnel. As we progressed further into the tunnel, we saw pure white mushrooms, attached to some of the wooden support posts, and wooden cross beams that supported the tunnel's ribs and ceiling.

Some sections of the tunnel we were walking in had water dripping from the ceiling and trickling down its ribs, which created a small steam of water that flowed down the center of the tunnel’s floor, in the direction we were walking. There were tunnels that branched off the tunnel we were in that had the light blue alkaline water across their twelve feet wide that also gradually ascended up their ribs as they went further back into the mountain.

The light blue alkaline water is poisonous and kills the fish and their habitats of the streams and rivers it seeps into.

When we stopped to rest and fell silent, the only sounds we could hear was our own breathing, and our hearts beating in our ears, and the soft to loud ker-plunk of pieces of sandstone, or slate dropping into the water in the branch tunnels or the thump as the pieces of slate or sandstone fell on the dry floor of the tunnels.

We could also hear the faint groans of the mountain as it shifted under the enormous weight of billions of stone and earth bearing down on the honeycomb coal beneath, and the even fainter echoing, through the stone of the mountain, as charges of high explosive exploded in the far off strip nines or deep nine when we turned our flashlights off and the darkness encompassed us, we could briefly see the faint outline of each other’s aura, and then we were in a complete and total darkness.

James and I had walked for what seemed to be two miles and we could see the sunlight at the end of the tunnel’s other exit.

About six months later we approached the same coalmine with the purpose of re-exploring it. But when we arrived at its adit, we discovered the adit was blocked by a solid wall of sandstone, the mine had caved in. To this day, (57 years later) I firmly believe that our guardian angels walked through that coal mine with us.

My friend James was killed serving in the United States Marine Corps, in North Vietnam in 1972, nine years after we had explored the above abandoned coal mine.
