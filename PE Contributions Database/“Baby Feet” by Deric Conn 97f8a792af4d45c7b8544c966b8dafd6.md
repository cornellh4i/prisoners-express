**“Baby Feet” by Deric Conn**

I, a lowly shepherd, have witnessed a most miraculous event: As my companions and I tended to our sheep in the night watch, lo, an angel sent from God appeared unto us and a most brilliant light shone round about us. The terror of the Lord seized us, bringing us to our knees. With pity and compassion, the angel looked upon us, and said unto us, “Fear not: for, behold, I cometh bringing you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.”

We slowly stood to our feet, as a peace indescribably took hold of us, and the angel continued to speak, “For unto you is born this day is the city of David a Savior, which is Messiah the Lord.”

I was unable to speak, wondering if this thing could be: had the One that the prophets of old had predicted would deliver God’s people really been conceived this day?

Before I could pose these questions, the angel spoke again, “And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.”

Before I could think too long on the lunacy that God’s Anointed One would be lying in feeding through, a multitude of the heavenly host appeared along with the angel, who spoke unto us and began praising the Lord. As I listened to their words, tears of joy streamed down my face that a one such as I would be blessed by the Lord God.

In perfect unity, the multitude said, “Glory to El Shaddai, glory in the highest, and peace on earth, goodwill toward men.”

After the angels were gone back into heaven, my companions and I stood for a while until our spirits prompted us to go to Bethlehem to see this thing which the Lord had made manifested to usward.

So we left in haste, and it came to pass, that we found as it had been told unto us, a man and his wife holed up in an animal stall, with the babe sleeping soundly in the manger.

We learned from his parents that our meeting with the angels and his being conceived in an animal stable wasn’t the only miraculous thing surrounding his birth.

For one thing, we discovered that Joseph was not the flesh and blood father of the child and that he was considering putting Mary away from him privily when he found out that she was with child until an angel of the Lord manifested himself to Joseph in a dream, telling him to not fear to take unto him Mary as his wife: “for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.”

And then Mary spoke unto us of how the angel, Gabriel, visited her to give her words of encouragement and comfort in her distress.

They also disclosed unto us that the angel which appeared unto them had told them that the boy’s name was to be Jesus, which is Yeshua in the Hebrew tongue, for he would save his people from their sin.

Upon hearing this, my companions and I dropped to our knees in adoration to God. Our cries of worship woke the lad from his nap and we quickly rose to our feet to look into the eyes of the newborn king.

Mary lovingly lifted the child into her arms, showing unto us his delicate body. I was stricken with awe as I looked upon the tiny hands and feet of the One who would one day change the world.

Joseph stood proudly next to his wife, telling us one other detail that the angel revealed unto him. The birth of this child was a fulfillment of prophecy which Isaiah wrote about, that a virgin would bring forth a son, and that he would be called Emmanuel.

My mouth was agape as the meaning of that name dawned on me: “God with us.” My spirit stirred with me. Would the Maker of the Universe become flesh and dwell among men? Would God himself put on skin and bone to deliver his chosen people from iniquity? Absolutely not! That sounded too absurd… But, then again, nothing is impossible with God.

I again looked to the child’s small form. Could those hands be God’s hands? Could those feet belong to the Master?

Soon afterwards, my companions and I headed out, going back to the field where we left our flock, and all the while we glorified and praised God for all that he had shown unto us.

All I can think of as I write this account down for others to read is the humble approach that the Lord chose to enter the earth; not as a rich king, though he is king, but through poverty, he intends to bring riches to his people. What a God we serve! I have been humbled by this experience and I pray that others are too after reading this. May God’s grace and peace be with you all. Amen.
