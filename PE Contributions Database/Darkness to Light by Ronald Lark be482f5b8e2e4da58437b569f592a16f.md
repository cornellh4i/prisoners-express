**Darkness to Light by Ronald Lark**

When I saw the picture of the man looking out the entrance of the cave, I felt like I was hit with a ton of bricks. The memory of a very vivid dream that I once had overwhelmed me, rushing back. Let me tell you about it…

I awoke, dazed and confused, not knowing where I was or how I got there. All I knew was that I had no clothes on, it was very cold, and I was finding it very difficult to move, let alone stand. I wasn’t hurt. It was as if I were using my muscles and limbs for the first time.

Wherever I was, it was completely dark. So, I started searching all around me for some trace of light that would allow me some focus and direction, some clue to where I was and how to get out of there.

As I turned I caught sight of a speck of light in the distance at the end of what seemed to be a long tunnel. So I made the effort to walk toward that light, in hopes that it would lead me to the answers of questions swarming in my mind.

Movement hadn’t come much easier for me yet, with walking being a struggle with each step taken. Though, the closer that I got to my goal, the easier it became. Mastering a simple capability that my muscles seemed to have forgotten.

As I got closer to the light, I realized that I was in a cave, walking toward its mouth. I thought, “what am I doing in a cave?,” with this question puzzling me to no end, forcing me to let it go. Especially with a new puzzle presenting itself as I walked out of a cave into the sunlight.

After my eyes adjusted to the newfound illumination that blanketed me, I saw that there were houses scattered in front of me, with some being built. Though, I noticed that there were no people nor animals, anywhere. An area that should have been teeming with life was totally deserted.

Walking through this housing development in search of some clue or someone that could let me know what was going on, and where I was, something suddenly caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. It was a reflection of light that held a possible promise of the answers that I had been seeking.

So, I then maneuvered for a better look at the enticement of my curiosity, discarding the roofed obstacle standing in my way. Behind the house, to my astonishment, I found that there was an enormous wall of gold distantly beckoning me to it.

It was somewhat difficult to make out from where I was, but there seemed to be a pair of eyes upon the wall that became more defined the closer I got. Though, at some point the eyes became a huge cross, or Catholic style crucifix (no, I’m not Catholic) and left me wondering if I just imagined seeing eyes there.

When I finally reached the wall of gold, standing before the crucifix shade in the wall, I looked for a door or gate that would allow me entrance beyond, unable to find one. I then began walking along the wall in search of such a passageway, only to wake up into reality. Needless to say, I awoke slightly disappointed, and  have questioned the dream ever since.
