**“Spiritual Food: Unsatisfied Hunger” by Alex Benjamin**

You see with your eyes all that life has to offer, yet you seek after contentment in the treasures of the world. You tread on the path of foolishness, idolizing materialistic things into existence to showcase your prideful nature. (Rom. 1:28)

Still, unable to satisfy your hunger, unable of being content, you rage war within yourself, lusting and wanting more and more to fulfill your desire, and vague ambitions and self gratification while pursuing the riches of the world. You have opened the floodgate of destruction, you have given the devil an open invitation to wreck your life. (Proverbs 16:18,19)

For the world gives with limitation, restriction and consequences, but the Lord promises to the samaritan woman, He assured her that all who drink the water I give, you will never be thirsty. Jesus has your desire and need at heart for He created you and I. He gives us a spring of water that flows into eternal life. (John 4: 1-25)

Jesus also promises that you will not want for anything, only He can satisfy your hunger, ambitions, lustful desire, prideful, and selfish motive. If God can satisfy this woman’s thirst, He most certainly can put an end to your unsatisfied hunger by replacing it with a never ending supplies of nourishments for your mind, body and soul which is the good news of the gospel! (John 4:1-25)

Are you hungry or thirsty? Do you have an unsatisfiable hunger that you can’t fill? I know a God who says; ask and you shall find, knock and the doors will be opened, seek and you shall find: Would you like to know him? (Matthew 7:7,9)
