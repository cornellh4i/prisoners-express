**Father and Son by Richard Schmidlkofer**

Abba Father is with me

He will never leave me or forsake me

He is my protector

He is my guide

He will chastest me

Abba Father has gave me instructions how to live in this world.

He has love me and take care of me.

Abba Father sacrifice His son to die for me and others in this world.

He is the best father.

I have to honor him and glorify him all the time

Hallelujah praise God!
