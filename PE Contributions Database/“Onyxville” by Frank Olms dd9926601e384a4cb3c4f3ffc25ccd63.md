**“Onyxville” by Frank Olms**

I had been driving along highway 41, heading south. It was a quiet section of the highway as it passed through a very rural part of the country. The roadway was lined with pine trees and the lower wetlands were tenanted by willows and maples.

The roadway had narrowed to just three lanes, reflecting the limited traffic flow. The middle lane was known as the ‘suicide lane’ as the lanes were separated by broken white lines...White lines haven’t been used since the 60s. I hadn’t seen another vehicle since I noticed the color change of the street lines and then a car came from the opposite direction: a 1940s something. A Ford?...

My car was getting low on fuel, but I hadn’t seen a gas station in...how long? Then a sign pointed to the left -- a black sign with white letters. Signs have been green since -- Hey, what year is this!? The sign read: Onyxville 2 Miles. I turned left. I passed over a small bridge and the road became dirt and bumpy. It appeared to me that I was traveling back in time...to another epoch.

As I entered the town I saw three buildings: Onxyville Gas and Oil, Onyxville Hotel, and Onyxville Bar and Grille. The gas station was now closed. There were no people or vehicles in sight, but a dog barked from somewhere in the distance.

I parked my car in front of the bar and went in. The atmosphere was nostalgic of the 1930s or early 40s. Smokey. Nobody seems to notice me. I sat at a table near the wall. There was a couple sitting at the table near me. They were dressed like it was Saturday night. I looked at my watch. It had stopped.

The man was obviously trying to make advances toward the lady who obviously wasn’t interested. I heard him exclaim “but I love you!” The lady then, smiling, turned her head to the left and looking straight at me said,

“That’s the funniest thing you’ve ever said to me.” And she began to giggle and laugh.
