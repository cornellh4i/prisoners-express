**“1000 Attacks a Day” by Delvin Diles #862751**

After I copped a plea for life to avoid a death sentence, I expected the proverbial “uphill battle”, “hard time” and “hell on Earth”. There was no way to foresee, as a 19-year-old who had never been to prison, the thousands of psychological attacks that come with doing time.

From the limited privileges used to control that leads to the annoyance of complaints from my fellow inmates who forget to be thankful, to the weeks without mail, years without visits, bacon cheeseburgers, intimate moments naked with baby, and another and ANOTHER! Episode of The Hobbit, et cetera, ad nauseum.

In the throes of all these moments of mental anguish, I’ve found that the only reprieve I have, the only way to counterbalance being forced to listen to Bruno Mars tell us once again “That’s What [he] Like”, is to remind myself that it could be worse. For this realization and free option, I’m thankful.
