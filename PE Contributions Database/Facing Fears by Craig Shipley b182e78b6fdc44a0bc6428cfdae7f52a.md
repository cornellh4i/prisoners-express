When I think of fear in relation to my time in prison, I immediately think about family. My greatest fear is that my Mama, step Daddy, Dad, etc. will die while I am in prison.

Of course I realize that death is a huge part of life. At some point, we will all die--that is just what happens. It still does not negate the fact that we miss our loved ones when they die.

I try to prepare myself for the fact that I may have to deal with Mama dying while I am in prison. There is only so much I can do to prepare, and I know if it does happen, it will be devastating

Being healthy in both mind and body will help, but it will be tough.
