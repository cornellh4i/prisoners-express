**“Helping Out” by Cesar Hernandez**

My friend needed to fly out with his mistress to celebrate her birthday. My friend asked me to help him out with his wife. His wife is always dragging him to charity events and making him write substantial checks for all kinds of charity causes. He has told me several times that all the money he gives to charity is to make up for his mistress. He sees things as being in balance. He keeps his mistress and donates to charity.

My friend needs me to accompany his wife to a charity event. He tells me to arrive at his mansion early. His wife needs to brief me. He tells me to dress to impress so I wear my Roberto Cavalli suit.

His wife Amanda is already ready to go when I arrive. She is wearing a Dolce and Gabbana evening gown that is very revealing. We step out of the mansion and there is a Maybach G2 with a redheaded female driver. I was used to seeing my friend in his BMW 7 series and John as his driver. The female driver is named Grace. I know my friend chose her since he doesn’t like redheads. Amanda has nothing to worry about.

In the Maybach I ask Amanda what happened to John and the BMW. she says John got a DUI and was fired. The lease on the 7 series was up so it was turned in. Amanda tries to brief me on the charity event but I have more interest in the Maybach. Amanda says the car cost just under four hundred thousand dollars. Amanda pulls out champagne out of the fridge for us. On the forty-two inch TV she pulls up photos of the expected people at the event.

At the location Grace hands me an envelope. Inside is a check for ten thousand dollars written out to the charity organization. Amanda and I are seated near the front at one of the ten thousand dollar tables. Each seat cost ten thousand dollars. My friend gave thirty thousand dollars to this charity in one night. I think that is ridiculous. The charity is a good cause but I think my friend should get rid of his mistress. He would save a lot of money and not have to donate to charity to get rid of his guilt.

I finally understand why my friend hates being dragged to charity events. Those events are places for the extremely wealthy to show off to one another. It is also a place to see and be seen. The food and wine is exceptional, yet a waste of resources. The food budget would have been better used on the actual charity cause.

My friend had a wonderful weekend with his mistress. He simply told his wife he had a very important business meeting. I told Amanda the same story. Amanda did not ever find out that her husband had a mistress since before they were married.
