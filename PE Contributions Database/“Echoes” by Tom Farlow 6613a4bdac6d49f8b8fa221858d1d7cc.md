**“Echoes” by Tom Farlow**

The paper was old, yellowed with age and had a rich, velvety texture to the touch. He thought of a lady’s writing desk nestled in the corner of the study where a stack of stationary stood, bought from the local paper mill, and used for correspondence to those she favored. Its corners and edges were darkened from the oily residue of fingerprints being soaked into the porous fibers over time. Well-worn creases testified to many foldings and unfoldings throughout the years as it was read and reread.

The paper rippled in Gil’s nervous hands because he could not keep them from shaking, He stumbled back into a corner of the old, musty attic and crumbled atop the floorboards; disturbed swarms of moats rising to play in precocious shafts of light. They soon tangled themselves into the mucus running from his nose, dark streaks left each time as he wiped his nose with the cuff of his shirt; finally diving into the tears that welled within his eyes, drawing forth more from the irritation. He spent a few minutes there composing himself before he read the note once more.

“My Dearest Love, I wonder when you will read this. I shall never know if you did or will, for, by now, I am passed into the ether of the eternal. Fear not my love, I am content at my journey’s end.

“Do you remember the first time we drove to the hospital for my treatments to begin? That is when this letter began to grow in the recesses of my mind. As we drove through the night, the lights felt as if they were silent saluters of support along the progression. We would pass one; whoosh. Then another; whoosh. It was there I started to think of what we leave behind for others to see when we are no longer here. I wanted to leave you something to break up the darkness of my absence as we often leave on lights to comfort us at night.

“In the days, weeks, and months that followed I retreated up here, into our attic, when you were gone to work. This has been a sort of refuge from the battle, so to speak.

“Every General lays down a war plan, and I am no different. Only, my plan cannot contain any hope of victory for myself. Instead, it has to be focused on fighting and defeating the despair that will suffocate my loved ones after death. The cancer may take me from you, but I shall not leave you without comfort.

“I have left these boxes of scrapbooks I made for you to enjoy and pass down. Memories of us for you to draw strength from, and to recall what you are worth to me. My life was never alive before I met you. It was always dead in the water; adrift without a reason. You become the rudder to steer me and keep me on point; our love the oars to drive us forward.

“You gave me a beautiful child. A son. No man can grasp the feeling of joy as life grows inside you and the weight of responsibility that awakens with the child asking to nurture and care for them. You, however, showed your understanding as only you could in your ability to be the ultimate provider. I love that for you.

“He is too young to know what it means to die. I fear I leave you to supply answers to so many tough questions because he is such an inquisitive child. I know you will try, though.

“I have left letters to give him as he grows up. He will, perhaps, always feel incomplete because I have left. Hopefully, this will fill some of the emptiness I leave. Words area petty replacement for presence. It’s all we have though.

“Don’t we search for immortality in some form or fashion, my love? Children are the very essence of that ideal, as they are the eternal echoes of our very being. They are the physical realization of that ideal, as they are the eternal echoes of our very being. They are the physical realization of a once-existed love between two people; the testament to the long-lived human dream of continuation. Our son, Gil, will carry on our hopes and dreams in all he does. Give him your love as you have always done for me.”

“I love you always and forever, Julia.”

Tears splashed onto the pages as Gil collapsed into a fit of wracking sobs, towered by the stacks of boxes his father left him upon his death.
