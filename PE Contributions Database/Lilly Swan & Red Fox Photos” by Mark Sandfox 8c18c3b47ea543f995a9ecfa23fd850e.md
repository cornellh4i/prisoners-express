**Lilly Swan & Red Fox: Photos” by Mark Sandfox**

****Little Suzie sat on her front porch in her swing, just a swingin. Painted toes, curly blonde locks, blue eyes, and a button nose. She was nine years old, just turned so last week, her most precious gift of all was clutched in her tiny hands, clicking away at her toes. Dozens of selfies already taken, her cat and dog, her bicycles, their house, her mom and dad, a rake in a pile of leaves, even their front door knob, clicked and saved for nostalgia. She held her bare feet straight out, then wiggled her toes for the camera.

“What the…” was as far as she got. Suzie stared, speechless, chin dropped to her chest, mouth a big “O.” She blinked… still there. She let the camera hang from her neck strap, rubbed her eyes with her tiny fist, opened her eyes… still there. Suzie rose from the swing, rushed to the porch railing, her view clear, unobstructed… and there it was. A fox, a red fox, pushing a wicker baby carriage up her front driveway, and if that was not odd enough, a goose, a white goose, sat in that carriage, nearly spilling over with it’s girth.

Click. Before Suzie even realized what she was doing, her new camera was to her eye, her little fingers clicking away frantically. This time she would have proof, yet never in her wildest dreams had she pictured a scene like this. It was Lilly Swan, who hated to be called goose, and Red Fox who was appropriately named so.

“Suzie lassie, come quick,” his voice gaelic and urgent, “Lilly is in a frightful state.”

Red could talk to her, crisp and clear, plain English and right in front of her mom and dad, and all her parents heard were yips, yeps barks, whimpers and whines.

“Oh please help me Suzie,” begged Lilly Swan, “My legs are all bound up and my clutch is coming soon.” British, prim and proper, like a snooty Mary Poppins.

Red pushed the carriage up the front porch. Suzie’s bare feet slapped down the stairs.

“How did you ever get yourself into this baby carriage?”

“Red helped, in his own way,” blushed Lilly.

A blushing goose? Suzie snapped off a few more shots. “Well we need to get you out of there. You have gotten so big Lilly. I won’t hurt the eggs if I lift you, will I?”

“No sweetie, but do hurry, please. I am starting to feel a lot of pressure down there.”

“Okay, hold still.” Suzie let her camera hang from its strap again, reaching under the fat goose, trying to cradle her like an overgrown baby, she lifted Lily from the carriage.. “Oh my… what is all of this?”

“It was in the water,” honked Lilly, “Probably left by the young humans from last night. They were out reveling all night.”

There was a six-pack plastic ring shackling both her web feet together then shrink wrap tight around and up her legs. Suzie laid Lily on the grass.

“I’m going to take some pictures first so I can show my Girl Scout leader. Okay?”

“Just be quick sweetie, I need to get back to my nest soon.”

Suzie snapped a dozen photos from various angles to show the devastation all that garbage out at Lilly Lake was causing. This time she removed the camera from her enck and placed it on the front steps, then got busy unwrapping Lilly from all the debris. Suzie got so mad while she was working that she yanked a little too hard once and Lilly honked.

When she was finished, Suzie hugged the silly Lilly white goose who thought she was a swan, then set Lilly Swan and Red Fox on their way, snapping picture after picture of their departure. After their wasn nothing left to take pictures of Suzie collected the debris and brought it in the house. She would need it for evidence, she thought and placed it all in a plastic bag. There was a Spring Cleanup project coming up with her Girl Scout troop, Suzie was determined to have them clean up Lilly Lake.
