**“Lucky Hole Chronics: Chapter 14-15” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

Mist oozed from between the trees, gathering, obscuring whatever lay before the train. The trees to either side closest to the tracks were visible, as well as some 20 feet in front of the train, but the rest was in oblivion. Silence had ceased to be terrifying. Now, it was tranquil. Victor’s atrophied conscience calmed, peaceful quiet reigned in and outside. Victor watched the fog roll away as he and his train surged steadily forward. Even his anger was slipping and fading.

“Greed,” I said, “I don’t know what Midget told you but-”

“Georgie Boy, I don’t have time for the bullshit.”

“No,no bulls-,” breathing deep, he continued, “I don’t know what he told you. Until the water ran out, I was being tortured. I said whatever I could-”

“Your people cut off the water, Georgie. It didn’t run out. Now…”

*Well, f-!* I thought, *that explains a lot… S-, I’m screwed again, Maldito sea!*

“Now talk Georgie. Talk fast.” There’s not much you can do when you’re not just outnumbered but hopelessly outgunned: as in, still recuperating - more than that -, suffering something like shock or dislocation or whatever. To top it all off, you’re at a gunfight and didn’t even bring a feather. Tension was rising, crackling, sizzling the very air. I had no real choice. I said, “ I want to be *claro*, like crystal, *¿sabes?* I haven’t been-”

“Greed. Thank you for helping our Georgie Boy,” said Rafa. At his back peace were a lot more than nine *chicanos*. Nobody's face matched Rafa’s words, they matched his tone.

“It’s the least we could do after what Joey did. Let’s call it a peace offering, huh?” Greed’s eyes never left mine. It’s amazing how what we say sometimes has nothing to do with what we mean.

“Is this a peace offering” asked Julia, violence naked in his eyes. People shifted. Movements accompanied by a low, increasing rumble of hearts pumping adrenaline. A bloody storm was close to bursting. What the f-? I stood, expecting that to be the spark. It wasn't. I took a step forward, certainly now. Nope. Another step, steps, *nada*. Julio’s eyes never left Greed’s. Everyone else either stared at me leaving or between the two lions. Back among my *gente*, I still couldn’t believe it was over.

Once upon a time, America had thought prison wasn’t enough. Not safe for the guards, staff, the public - no one really gave a s- about us. So, they had built a multi-billion dollar concrete, god damn cage. Luckless State Prison Lucky Hole. That had been America’s answer, over 300 acres of steel, concrete and lethality. Lock away the problems and that will cure the country. But it hadn’t, had it? Victor continued musing about Lucky Hole, life and nature’s beauty. Yes, it was beautiful to be free, even if you were stranded on an island. Before him spread other islets and a vast body of water. Behind him, there was Lucky Hole. There could be no going back.

“Yo, my brothas, it’s that time,” said Abdul. Each man with him had only one purpose. None expected to cross No Man’s Land again.

Surreal doesn’t even begin to cover it. I’d gone from the hellside of purgatory to hell proper to something completely not hell at all. *¿De veras se suceidó esto?* I guess it really did happen because we were already past the library, our zone within sight. As happy as I was, I couldn’t breathe, too many people, too many changes. I stopped. Julio and Rafa stopped also then, so did Manuel and eventually everybody else. For the third time in the last two hours, I was the center of attention. One step back turned into two, two into five then, I bolted. I ran back to my only refuge.

“Fuck you!” rasped Deón from inches away, his knife sinking down some seven inches into his third victim’s neck, piercing lung and arteries. Deón had become a madman as only grief and vengeance can create. He moved off to find a fourth when the fourth found him. Eli had always been a scrapper. Whether bare fist brawling or playing with shiny toys, he was it. Deón had no clue what hit him, neither did Eli.

“*¡Qué va!*” exclaimed Manuel, “What the hell? *¿Qué le anda mal con ese huey?*”

“Manny, *ven conmigo y Rafa*,” said tired Julio, “we’ll get Georgie and you fools. We’ll meet back home.” Rafa had already wheeled off. Julio and Manuel watched the others leave. Without looking at him Manuel said, “We should let ‘em go…”

“*Ya lo sé*,” replied Julio walking in the other direction. Manuel took his time catching up.

The seascape was beautiful. A soft breeze caressed his face carrying fresh coolness. The dock was well-worn. Hundreds, thousands of times boots, high-heels, sneakers and even sandals had pounded its planks. Peaceful is what would have come to mind and Victor not been stranded. From the islet, he could see the mainland standing on the pier. Walking around its several couple hundred square footage, he could also see Hell. No wonder Lucky Hole was really escape proof: it was the only thing for miles in an oceanic desert. The train led back to hell. Not even an option. Victor cried for the first time since his father had died. “*¡Qué dulce amargura!*” was all he mustered.

“*No, no puedo más*,” I pleaded to no one, “I just can’t.” It’d been too motherf-ing much. I doubt they had ever understand. When they found me, I was huddled in the very back of the library. I was fetal position, rocking back and forth, whimpering. One positive thought, I wasn’t crying. For whatever that’s worth.

Nobody moved, let alone said a word since old Georgie Boy and company had left. From the looks on these nine faces, everyone was thinking the same thought: now what?

Swimming wasn’t much of an option either. There weren’t many resources on the island other than a few trees, benches, vending machines, and a prefabricated indoor restroom. Victor thought about it again. I could swim; I mean it doesn’t look that far. I could do it. *Lo puedo pero, ¿hay tiburones?* Sharks or no sharks, stay or swim. Victor wouldn’t go back to Lucky Hole and couldn’t live on Coca-Cola and paydays forever.

“What else?” ordered Tonka. He looked about ready to split wood barefisted. Midget knew he didn’t want the “Murphy Treatment.” screwing up what tiny balls he had, he said, “I said it all a zillion f-ing times! I-”

“Well, say it again,” only Greed’s hand laid on Tonka’s shoulder stopped what would have been an onslaught of biblical proportions. Midget launched into it again. Old Gerogie Boy had been nodding out in the library, reading a history book or something. He’d thought he’d solved the unsolvable: how to escape Lucky Hole forever. Then, he had woken up to Murphy and his five friends. He had told Murphy that he had been reading that book when he had figured it all out. Midget’s tale was done. Silence and nervous glances. Tonka was barely contained. Greed, head angled as if in prayer. Tonka awaited the signal, any signal.

“Alrighty then,” said Greed, “we go to the library.”
