**Rescued by Roderic Pippen Sr.**

Rescued comes from the word “rescue,” which is defined as “to free or save from danger, imprisonment, evil, etc.” No man with even the smallest pride would admit to being rescued. Below I will give a few instances of when I was truly rescued.

The first would be the actions of my old sister Leah. We grew up in a household with two parents battling addiction. So things were bad for us, but her being older than me, she understood more. And Leah shielded me from the harsh reality of our situation. But as 15 she left to pursue a better life.

That would make me 9 years old, and without my shield, I was exposed to life. And I had nobody to make my decisions for me, or hold me accountable. I had to learn from my experiences, this was the 90s on the eastside of Detroit. So you can guess that I gravitated to the wrong things.

Fast forward to the year 2000, I’m 13 now and have been arrested twice. My sister would return and give me a soft place to land out juvenile detention. Leah had an apartment, a job, and some desperately needed structure for her brother. This is where I would clean up my act and catch up in school. But eventually I would self-sabotage and relapse into my criminal addiction.

For the next 14 years, Leah would continue to rescue me from myself. Giving me hope, motivation, and a safe place emotionally. Without her I would have succumbed to my foolish ambition. Even now after being sentenced to LIFE in prison for over six years, she is still here to protect her baby brother.

Next would be my son’s mother Jazme. Many look for a partner and never find one. In one of my most tumultuous years of life, she was there for me, throughout the year of 2008 we had many highs and lows. But our highlight of the year wasn’t the parties, the dates, or living together.

It was finding out she was pregnant with our son. Before this moment, my life had no purpose. I lived to see 21 years old, when I wasn’t expected to make it to 18. I lived my life day to day with no responsibility for anything or anyone.

With Jazmen deciding to have our child even after I got locked up, gave me purpose. In every sense Jazmen rescued me from the irresponsible lifestyle I was leading. Now everyday is about my son, and how I can help him grow without all the negative experiences. It takes an extraordinary effort to be involved in Roderic Jr’s life, but it’s a step up from my part mundane existence. And I can truly admit that Jazmen’s decision really gave me purpose and saved my life.

Lastly, I have only had two serious relationships where I was fully invested. One was with JAzmen, that saved me life. The second was with JeLois that helped me realize my potential.

We were friends for over 5 years, before we decided to go further into our relationship. Although it only lasted six months, the experience would give me lessons for life. I have always been present and involved with my family, but I never knew the effect I could have on people or how much I actually knew about life.

I never tried to go beyond the below average expectation of a felon. Nothing I do is for myself anymore, I have people that look up to me and value my opinion. Just being there isn’t living, providing, educating, and helping others is doing something. A lot more than I did before, and what I will use to reshape my future.

Which before dating JeLois I never knew, now I can look forward to smashing my way through set standards. I am my own person, and I’m not afraid to step out of my comfort zone in pursuit of what nobody thinks I can achieve. JeLois rescued me from the handcuffs I put on my potential. And though we rarely speak since my incarceration, I will always  be grateful she opened my eyes.
