***Freedom* by Curtis Colvin**

Freedom is what I lost and want the most. I lost my job, truck, family, friends, and all my possessions. I lost my freedom to move, do, eat, sleep, drive, even walk when and where I want to. My whole way of thinking had to change to deal with this environment. So you can say I lost my thoughts also.

Freedom to drive where I want, visit whom I please, and to taste wonderful foods again would make me very happy. My own bed (with a pillow) would put me in heaven. A dip in a pool or bath would be a blessing.

Fly a kite, play a video game, walk a dog, climb a tree, play frisbee, ride a go-cart, walk a beach, catch a fish, go to a dance, I could go on and on about all the freedoms I lost. But soon I’m up for parole and if it’s God’s will, freedom will taste so great!
