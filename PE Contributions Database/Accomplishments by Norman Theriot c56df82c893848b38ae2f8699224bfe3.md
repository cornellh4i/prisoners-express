**Accomplishments by Norman Theriot**

What is life? Do it a measurement of attitudes gained, of successes and failures, wino and lesser. Do it looking back, or looking forward, or is it living for the moment?

I have gone through life never really paying attention, living for the moment, forever in search of the next rush, something that is here one moment then gone the next.

Getting high, gambling on doing whatever cheating death, previewing until another day. What was accomplished, a temporary rush dating to memories as it happened. Winning or losing looking for the next big thing, or to find that rush, I have been told that I have an addictive personality. The temporary high, a strong threshold for pain, a non-caring attitude of what happens to me one day to the next.

I have done all kinds of extreme crap, bungee jumping, hang gliding, 3ve jumping out of airplanes. To cheat death was so extreme, to walk away, man. I played russian roulette one time, the other guy chickened out after I pulled the trigger the first time, I was high and really didn’t care. There is no accomplishment in any of this only vague memories of times that I was really stupid.

Days or weeks I can’t recall because the drug and/or alcohol tupier muddied my memory, there are prolly many things that I have done that I don’t remember.

The blackouts, waking up in places that I cannot remember going to or how and the hell I got there. One time I remember lying on the Louisiana Gulf Coast then finding myself in Corpus Christi Texas a four days later, I wonder how many people out there can relate to this.

There have been lights, can wrecko and waking up in jail none accomplishment of a same and righteous life, I have let many people down so many times.

I go through the paces of life. I have explored the possibilities. I have accomplished some goals only to later squander them in pursuit of something better. It seems the more that we have the more we want. It appears that we can never have enough, on that we need more and better.

I see animals around this farm, they can leave if want yet they stay. They are happy with what they want, even within the core lines of prison walls, They seem to have accomplished all that they want set out for. Food, shelter, and to reproduce. Nothing more, nothing less. The fends, cats, and nats due free within these walls.

Human life is so much more complicated. So much competition, displeasure and discord. We live with hatred and anger. Jealousy and envy have their part too. It’s a small wonder that there is anything left of the human race with all of the extra luggage we carry in a day to day life. The main thing men here have accomplished is getting ourselves locked up for long periods of time. All of the persistive things in our lives have been turned negative

In prison everything changes, we seek to accomplish renewed freedom while we understand that our lives have changed, nothing will ever be the same. Some of our right are misdeed and in so many ways we all frowned upon by society.

I think though we can once again have some success with perseverance to overcome the stigma that comes with the overwhelming odds we are faced with after incarceration. We can still accomplish late in life. Happiness and peace of mind can be acquired but will take work.

I have known love which is a great accomplishment for truly it is better to have loved and lost than to have never been loved at all. The greatest accomplishment I can think of would be to die happy–knowing that my life isn’t in vain. To die with a free spirit.
