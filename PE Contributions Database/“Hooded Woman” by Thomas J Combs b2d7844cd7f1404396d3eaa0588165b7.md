**“Hooded Woman” by Thomas J. Combs**

Death is a master, one which, no matter how we try, we cannot control. We must come to the good, healthy realization of this fact. We must respect that unseen force, that power.

We do, though, have the power to change. Although at such times we are unaware as to how it will affect our futures, good or bad, thus possibly leading to a premature death of ourselves, someone we love, and quite honestly some innocent bystander we have not, nor ever will, meet.

We see a woman in a black dress and matching veil. Is she mourning over the loss of someone because we ignored our own, or refused to help some else’s troubles? Or in fear and depression we ran from? Look closely, she looks familiar. No, not a past lover, the wife of a friend, or maybe one’s sister that we only saw a slight glimpse of once? Thank hard, and make a real exhaustive survey of our past life as it has affected others.

Now she mourns a loss, for whom we cannot be certain. Wait, which direction did she come from? Is it possible that I retrace her steps, and find a recently covered grave? Perhaps the grave diggers are still at work filling it in. That would confirm I have found the correct spot. Then I can look at the name on the grave.

So which direction was it? I turn to look at her once more and she almost disappears. I race to catch up again.

But for what purpose? I can’t bring myself to bring back any memories as her tears now have dried. Besides, it’s not my place to ask.

Wait, why am I following her? Have I now become a stalker. Wow, what a pathetic life I live. I do things without bothering to pay attention to how it might affect the lives around me, until it’s too late. Like now. I stop walking, and look up to the sky, not sure how to ask for help when I only do so when I get so low I can’t seem to manage on my own. But no matter, I mumble a plea to help me become more aware. For no one should have to endure a loss and live alone. If anyone knows this it’s me. We are not able to live alone with our pressing problems and the character defects which cause or aggravate them.

I have forced myself to live by myself with those tormenting ghosts of the past that continue to haunt me into my future. I have the knowledge, the ability, and fortitude to change. I just need the courage to stick with it. To better myself and to avoid any unneeded bad reactions that could potentially lead to even more widows such as she. Let humans pass from natural causes because mourning and death due to loneliness and a broken heart, truly do exist.
