**Life's Purpose by John Naylor** 

I remember Hinberg Rd. Church of Christ in Anderson reading Rick Warren’s “The purpose driven life” together in my youth. The great question of all labels of belief, even atheism is “What is the meaning of life?” Could it all be random events. God forbid, what a depressing thought. Such thoughts may be comforting to people in rubber rooms with arm and leg restraints but probably not too many others. Purpose is more than meaning to me. When a child is disciplined the meaning is to connect negative behavior as measured by generally accepted norms and opinions of society and communities of faith. The meaning behind such supervision is to stop what the ‘tribe’ finds offensive. Though it can also be to keep his archer growth from being stunted emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Stunted people rarely if ever reach their full potential. God nor man could truly love us if we were kept from our life's purpose and greatest potential due to a lack of correction. Especially when it means sustainable happiness and true meaning that's absolutely fulfilling. Parents, good parents discipline their children. God disciplines his children too. If life has no cares, no trials you should probably be concerned. Because you could very well be traveling down a path to your own destruction. You could miss God’s best for your life and your purpose. The good news is it’s not too late. Even if you’ve ruined it. Anything can be forgiven by God. God’s second, third, fourth plan for your life, even beyond the fourth try is still God’s plan. God can still give you true meaning in your life and purpose. It may be to enrich your family's lives. It may be to show the Gospel or be an encouragement to others. Or to help a young newbie adjust. I’ve had men do that for me. In Pendleton Correctional Facility, right here in Indiana I’ve tried to do that for others. Some grew to hate me because they chose to miss their purpose and be negative. It doesn’t have to be your story. Being in a quiet state like Indiana can’t stop you.
