**“Simple Things” by Carl Branson**

Having the theme “thankful” due a mere 8 days after celebrating the Thanksgiving Holiday was a stroke of genius!

Normally, I awake on Thanksgiving morning saying, “Oh yeah, this is Thanksgiving Day so I should give some thought to what I have to be thankful for.” Maybe all of sixty seconds later, the hackneyed list includes parents, siblings, children, grandchildren, teachers, friends, and good health. But this year, because of the essay topic, the time spent contemplating the various aspects of being “thankful” was constantly on the back burner of my brain for a few weeks.

Certainly, the annual short-shrift list was the first to bubble up and constantly demand the spotlight. Getting past that annoyance took some brutal mental barrier breaking to reveal those less obvious persons, places, and things that I can, and should, be thankful for. This is particularly true in the prison environment where it is all too easy to become inured to the lackadaisical, if not contemptuous, attitudes of staff and fellow inmates. Here it’s the simple things that go either unnoticed or quickly forgotten.

Examples of courtesies that go unnoticed include that fellow inmate who pauses momentarily to hold the exit door so it doesn’t slam in your face as you follow him out, or the staff member who allows you to use his lighter because the prison-supplied communal electric lighters are burned out (again/still). Then there are those rare few staffers, particularly in the education department, who actually believe prisoners are people with talents beneficial to avoiding boredom and inactivity.

I was lucky enough to work with two such teachers for roughly five years. Through their pleadings to upper level administration we were able to offer “adult enrichment” programs to our fellow felons. The most popular “classes” were drawing/art, graphic novel design, creative writing (short stories, novels, etc.), and a poetry workshop. In each case the curriculum was designed by the prisoner who subsequently conducted the course. I was lucky enough to benefit from those programs both as a student and as an instructor. Sadly, these programs “died on the vine” when one of the teachers retired and the other transferred to another position. Their replacements were unwilling to expend the effort required to continue the project. But, it was a truly beneficial run while it lasted for which I am extremely thankful.

I won’t bore you with the hundreds, if not thousands, of those other “simple things” that boiled to the surface of memory from before and after entering prison for which I am thankful. I will, however, express my thanks to each and every one of my fellow authors whose insights on assigned topics/photos are always stimulating. Also, there must be a standing ovation and an endless round of applause for the staff and volunteers at Prisoner Express who make all of this possible. The words “thank you” are wholly inadequate as a reward for their dedication and effort.
