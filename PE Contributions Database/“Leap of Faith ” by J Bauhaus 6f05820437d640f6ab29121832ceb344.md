**“Leap of Faith?” by J. Bauhaus**

This concept is foreign to me. It seems to mean a lack of appreciation for statistics. For example, the math of statistical analysis says that I have a zero chance of flapping my arms and flying away to where the sadists do not make up an appreciable proportion of the local population.

Reality obeys physical rules. We can wish all we want, but wishing has no effect on the outcome. Unless someone notices your desire and chooses to supply some motive force--that’s called karma. Many people who don’t understand reality will attribute random, chance positive outcomes as intervention by mythical beings. To create something out of nothing, which has not the slightest evidence of existence, is probably the maximum leap of faith. It seems to have been built by people who are determined to avoid the indisputable facts.
