**"Practical Joke"** **by George Dominguez**

I remember when I would play some practical jokes on my friends in school, especially in science class. Our teacher would give us dead frogs, but while he told us what we were going to do in class for the next day, I replaced a dead frog with a live one. One of my friends picked it up, and it jumped--boy! ****He ran, and we were laughing because he fell off his chair. The frog jumped over to the other table where this dude and chick sat, and the girl started screaming! No one knew who had done it.

Another time when I was at a party, I played a joke on my girlfriend. We were all drinking and smoking pot, and I told my friend that I wanted to play a joke on my girl and asked if he was in. He said yea, so I asked him if he had some tomato sauce, not ketchup cause you could smell it. I told him to bring me a big knife, and I poured the sauce on me and laid on the ground outside with the knife on my side. My friend ran inside telling everyone that someone stabbed me, and I’m all blooded. When my girl saw me, she started screaming and crying, then I got up and said “April’s Fool!” When I saw her grab a big stick to pop me with, I ran all the way home, and when I got home, my brother saw me and got scared. He thought something had happened, and I told him what I did and why.

But what I won’t forget is when I was about 6-7 years old, and my oldest brother was 10 and other brother was 8. We would get the ketchup that came with the burgers and go outside to play-squeeze the ketchup at one another. I got my oldest brother on his knee, and he started yelling. I really got so scared when he ran after me like a crazy boy. Later, he was laughing so hard that tears were coming out of his eyes. I couldn’t sleep that night, and so I would go to my parents’ room and tell them I couldn’t sleep. No, they never knew what we did because if they did, we were going to get it.

On Halloween, I would going trick-or-treating, and when I was about 4 years old, I saw a dummy sitting out on the front porch. My parents knew the people there, and so when I got to the door and rang the bell, I kept my eyes on it. I told myself don’t be scared, though it seemed to be fixing to do something. My sisters weren’t with my brother and me, and my dad stood behind. When it got up, my face was so white, my brother ran to my dad, and my dad was laughing. The zombie was standing right about me with his hands in the air, looking down at me. Believe me, I was scared, and I couldn’t sleep that night. So the next day, I went to my big brother and asked him if I could sleep with him.

You know the saying that goes: life’s full of practical jokes.
