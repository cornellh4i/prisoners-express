**“Hooded Woman” by Lorraine Bennett-Kenitzki**

The day was warm, sunny; bright for such an occasion as this. The birds flew overhead, and sat on branches in the nearby trees. “Chirp, chirp”, singing their songs.

The contrast was like the image, or shadow on a movie screen. It was dark and black, but pretty. It distracted from the scenery, it distorted the message sent by the cheerful avian.

She wore a face of a porcelain doll, in a black dress. Her veil was like one from an old, black & white movie. It matched her hair, eyebrows & lips.

Why was she so pretty, yet so dark? All at the same time. Her nails wore black polish, and her legs were covered in blak netting style stockings inside shiny black, rhinestone buckled shoes.

I didn’t see her cry as she stood on the freshly cut, green grass. I didn’t see anyone else beside her.

Any warmth from her must have drained down and out her expensive heels to join the body that lay in the coffin before her.
