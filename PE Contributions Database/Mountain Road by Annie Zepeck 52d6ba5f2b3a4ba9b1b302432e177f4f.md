**Mountain Road by Annie Zepeck**

Don’t know how I got here. I found myself lying on this empty paved road. It seemed that just seconds ago I was in a crowded city, the humming chatter of countless faces, like a busy hive, dulling me to sleep.

In my stupor, was I somehow miraculously transported to this quiet place of solitude? Am I facing north, south, what? I wonder.

The mountains and clouds ahead seem to be calling me forward. Daring my sense to indulge in their quiet splendor. The air here seems purer, refreshing and cleansing. The soot and soil is being drawn out of me by the hand of an unseen exorcist. I can still smell the diesel clinging to my cheap flannel shirt, like a leech clinging to a fresh wound.

I begin to remember that I may have been here before. As  they say, I’m having a deja vu experience. The awkwardness of finding myself here has passed and fear rears its ugly head. All the realities of life find their way into my growing consciousness. Questions spring up like nearby dandelions. How do I get out of here? Where am I? Where is everyone? What will I eat? Is there water near? Dear God, help me?!? Is there a God? Is He listening to me? Am I just talking to myself? How far is the nearest town?

It will get dark soon and I need shelter. I’m not dressed for the occasion. I need a jacket and thermal underwear. The mountain air has chilled my bones and I don’t know how long I was lying on the pavement. I can feel the cracks of the pavement tattooed on my cheek. And realize I have to get out of here, but which way do I go? I search my pockets for some kind of useful object, Could I start a fire if need be? Hell no, I’m from the city, I’ll freeze to death. I reach into my shirt pocket and I find a paper. It’s a note. I read it out loud, after all who will hear me?

“If you’re reading this you’ll realize you’re in the middle of nowhere. Nowhere is the condition we found you in and nowhere is the place you need to find yourself out of. Good luck, I hope you make it”.
