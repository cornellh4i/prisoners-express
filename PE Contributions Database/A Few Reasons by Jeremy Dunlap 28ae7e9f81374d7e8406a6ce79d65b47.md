**“A Few Reasons” by Jeremy Dunlap**

Life will beat the hell out of you; be grateful for its lessons. Don’t be hard-headed when God is trying to show you something. That lesson may come from a personal experience, but it can also come from what happens to another. Don’t try and learn to be a better criminal because it will lead to the same place.

Be grateful for opportunities to further your education. It really is good to be intelligent, well-read, and thoughtful. These qualities will take you places in life that being ignorant and impetuous won’t. Be grateful for an honest friendship, a deep conversation, and a laugh in the midst of chaos.

Be grateful that life is painful and a struggle. Only the dead don’t struggle. Be grateful that trials make you stronger and be grateful when pain mysteriously turns into beauty. Be grateful when you can use your strengths to help another who is going through what you’ve survived. What good is being strong unless it can be used to help the weak?

Be grateful for family, friends, and love. Be grateful that even behind a fence you can make a positive difference. Be grateful for sunshine, rain, and snow. Be grateful for your soul and to the God who made it all. Be grateful so that when the days of ungratefulness come, and they will, there will still be a lot to be thankful for. Just remember the places to look.
