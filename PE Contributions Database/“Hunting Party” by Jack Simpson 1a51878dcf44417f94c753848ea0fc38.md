**“Hunting Party” by Jack Simpson**

This week is for the fellows. Hunting and camping are not one of the strong suits of our wives. Some people I won’t say find that perfect someone. In the case of David and I, opposites do attract.

David’s wife loves to shop and buy all the latest and flashy things money can buy. She would rather eat out than cook. It has to be the finest or nothing at all.

In my case, my wife is a little different. She loves to cook and spend time cleaning the house. One thing she is not fond of is the outdoors.

David and I had planned this trip months in advance. All the details were taken care of and all we had to do was go. We would fly out on a Friday and come back the same day next week. Of course I didn’t know that David was afraid of heights, so I would have to pull him aboard a plane.

Trish brought David and Molly brought me. We arrived at the same time in order to be aboard and leave, as the weather was still good. David sat down and didn’t say a word. He had this grin that I hadn’t seen before. I figured he had taken a snort of alcohol or a pain pill. Either way, I wasn’t going to let it hamper my weekend.

When we landed in Montana, the guide we hired was there to pick us up. He held a sign and we waved to get his attention. No guns were allowed on this trip. All we had was a camera. Our first day out, we stood on a ridge overlooking a valley. Snow was everywhere. A few Elk ran across the snow. Once in a while, you would spot a wolf. The back of the ridge had a shear face to it. It not only helped to block out the wind, but it gave us an advantage for wild animals.

Sam was telling us how wolves would come into the camp at night and our best protection was the fire and his 30/30. He was the only one allowed to carry a rifle. The temperature would drop to a nice cold of ten below zero. That is the wind chill figure in. Our sleeping bags would keep us good and warm.

During the night, we heard all the howls they made. When one started, it soon became to at least a dozen. That night no one slept through all the howling. David had gotten in his sleeping bag early. He thought they couldn’t get to him there. Well, I sure wasn’t going to be dragged off without a fight.

The sun was just breaking the ridge of the highest mountain peak. Below it was finally getting light enough to see the shadows of the trees and movement. This was what we had been waiting for. Three wolves were on the hunt, after a buck Elk who was out running them by a margin. I took pictures of the hunt. We’d never seen one taken down the whole time.

The Coleman stove was popping now and the sound of bacon frying brought me closer to the pot of coffee that had been heating up. The rest of the week seemed to fly by so fast. We both didn’t want to leave. At least I could have stayed on another week. I believe David was ready to go when we got talking about the wolves. He was sitting there with that grin and it really bothered me. It wasn’t like him to sit and not respond to anything we talked about.

I must have used ten roles of film and eaten so much bacon and drank so much coffee. I guess I gained a few pounds from all of this.

Once we started back, David still sat with that grin on his face. I do believe he was possessed. I know one thing, he won’t have a lot to tell his wife, other than the photos I took. Some people are built for the outdoors and are just like the wolves, who love a good hunting party.
