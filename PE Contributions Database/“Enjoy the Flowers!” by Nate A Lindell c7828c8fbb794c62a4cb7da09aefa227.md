**“Enjoy the Flowers!” by Nate A. Lindell**

There are several women whom I wish I was able to send flowers to, even though the majority decided to part ways with me (not because I did them wrong…). It would, I’d hope, be a well-received form of stalking- what woman would dread a surprise bouquet with well wishes and a compliment cryptic enough (e.g. “For a beautiful woman. Your ‘Favorite Psychopath’ wishes you well.” The fille who called me that was into horror movies, thought I looked like Pinhead- I guess that was a compliment) to allow her to imagine they came from someone she was crushing on?

Nothing weird about that, is there?

Those women brightened my days with their letters, written as only girls can do: with multi-colored ink, perfume, some with charmingly filthy imaginations, others with baffling concerns (small tits are irrelevant to me) about their appearances (hairy legs ain’t a problem either- but my woman can’t have a thicker moustache than my thin Gallic one!). So, I wish I could brighten theirs.

Not all the women I wish I could send flowers to are loved or even liked by me. But, sending flowers, what a great way to say:

“Ha ha! You gotta settle for them lame dudes out there! Bet none of them are sending you flowers out of the blue! See, ya shoulda busted me out, coulda hid me in your basement, pulled me out when ya needed attention- and Id’ve been cool with that! But nooooo- ya chose to live a life of quiet romantic desperation with some runty wienered metrosexual who can’t even get a stiffy d, if he did, it’d nauseate you to touch it. Bet your kids’ll be awesome! Enjoy the flowers.”
