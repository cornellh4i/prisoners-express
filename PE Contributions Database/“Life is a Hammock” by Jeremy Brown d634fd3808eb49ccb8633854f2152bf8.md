**“Life is a Hammock” by Jeremy Brown**

I am in a remote area of the world. I’ve never seen anything like it. My boat capsized. Adrift at sea, I could not believe my eyes. There before me was land. So grand, I thought it was an illusion. This was no delusion. I was really seeing land. I met a tribe of native people in their natural environment. They were simple-minded, short in stature. They were a loving tribal people from my observations. Most of the day they slept in hammocks. At night they would disappear into a cave.

I was trying to figure out some things. Where was their food? Whatever did they do in this cave? After observing them myself I got myself together and asked them. The chief spoke to me, “Our hammocks give us sustenance from the sun. Inside of the cave we study the secrets of the universe. And we know all languages. We are the caretakers. We are the Un.”

I say, “OK, if that’s really what you want to do. I mean there’s a whole world out there. They would love to be taught your secrets.” The Chief replied, “You now understand, white devil, we are the ones who gave Egypt civilization both after and before. We have been here since beginningless Time. We have no power. Power is in flux, just like the world. Realize this, and save yourself. Join us in our quest of liberation.” With that I said, “Yes, I am one with you.”
