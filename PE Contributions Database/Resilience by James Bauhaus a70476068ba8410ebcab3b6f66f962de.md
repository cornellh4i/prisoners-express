**Resilience by James Bauhaus**

It takes a lot of resilience to get through prison. You’ve got people pushing and pulling at you from all sides, day and night. The screws want to take everything you have and leave you chained to the floor. The inmates want everything you have too. You can’t open a bag of coffee without 20 people showing up with their empty palms out and a sob story to tell you. They’ll take your last grunion, if you’re weak enough to let them sky off with it. The inmates don’t usually have any resilience or even a sense of the future. They demonstrate this by pre-spending every penny that they think that they will get. They often use a scam that makes you believe that they have plenty-dollah coming next week; “Can you give it to me now, and I’ll pay you double later?” You can usually spot this scam by just noticing how many front teeth they still have, or if their nose is all scrunched up, or if their heads are all skobbed-up…

You know, going over this has changed my thinking. Judging by all the injuries that the inmates sustain and absorb in their endless search for caffeine, nicotine, sugar, dope and alcohol, I begin to realize that some of them really are very resilient!
