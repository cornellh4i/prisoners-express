**“No Way to New Way” by Wesley Plater**

I wish I could say I defeated every problem that came my way. I wish I could say I blocked all the negative influences that I was exposed to. But nobody is perfect in this perfectionist world. We cannot say what tomorrow will bring and we cannot live in the past; we can only live in the here and now. If you are willing to learn, study, and build your knowledge, you will be able to use that knowledge to defeat your problems. One by one you will see them crumble. By no means is it easy to thwart anything, but with practice you will be able to take control and be able to think in high stress situations. You will become a leader who people look up to because you will be able to use your mind to defeat and block any and every problem that is thrown your way.
