**Morbid Tourism- A Guide by Edward Cortez Williams Jr.**

Up the way is the Kotahan House

On the corner of Tzal and Mavet

Not a step closer than a hundred long yards

Is as close as the wise ones will get

Eleven poor families have lived in that house

And eleven poor families have died

Only one man’s tried to topple that house

Two college students tried to study the house

And two ignorant children went blind

They foolishly tried to drive back to the dorm

And were crushed by a semi behind

One hundred LONG yards and not an inch more

Please don’t cross the line in the sand

One foolish boy went up fifty and danced

And he went back to go tell the band

He was playing his oboe the very next day

And he paid for that time spent to gloat

He tripped and he fell on a tiny gold bell

And his instrument dove down his throat.

Up the way is the Kotahan House

Its windows are open and stark

From a distance it seems that the sun, when it beams, is quite useless at lighting the dark.

And if you should choose your own heartbeat to lose

And decide to go sauntering near

The first thing you’ll notice? An image, a lotus

Inscribed on the chimney at rear

For the back of the house views the front on the street

Yes, you must go around to get in

You may stay there a day or a month or a year

For your death, not the if, it’s the when

It doesn’t seem bad at the Kotahan House

Oh, unless you are out, looking in

Is there dust there? A lot, but the stove gets quite hot

And the moldings are fancy, yet thin

You can have a good dinner, you can have a good lunch,

For the table is comfy and nice

But at night when you sleep, your clock, ticking, will creep

To the date when your blood turns to ice

Up the way is the Kotahan House

On the corner of Tzal and Mavet

Just one hundred long yards, no further, no higher

Or it shall be a trip you regret
