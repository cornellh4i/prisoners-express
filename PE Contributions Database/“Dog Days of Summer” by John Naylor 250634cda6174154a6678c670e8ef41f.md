**“Dog Days of Summer” by John Naylor**

I can still remember Mom trying to explain what it meant. You know that some items may be on discount at the later stages of summer. You know if a kid had a winter birthday you’d be hard pressed to find a great squirt gun to give away. I thought on what a kid, a boy would likely put on a wish list for a winter birthday. Maybe a BB gun if he were older. As we went into the old store it seemed Mom had some ideas for bargains. She thought clothes, boys think squirt guns. Well clothes are nice, some new shirts and stuff. I primarily wear short sleeved shirts all winter. T-shirts over button ups. Somehow a button up T-shirt or polo shirt looks different than a short sleeve button up being worn in the winter. Despite looking things seemed to be picked over. We seemed to have arrived a bit too late. Lawn and garden still had some flowers. I couldn’t tell you whether the store was going out of business and selling out summer items. My years have grown that detail thin. I can tell you that K-mart is now closed and vacant. At least as recent as the summer of 2004 before I was arrested.

I knew at that point or shortly after that the K-mart would be gone. The competition was too much for the old K-mart. Sort of sad, we used to shop for a few small items in the past. The face of retail was changing. It wasn’t just that the American dream grew farther from everyone’s reach. Though it was surely a contributor. We’re in a global economy. The internet draws everyone in every country closer. The world is nearly one big neighborhood only separated by political borders. Or what amounts to a boarder, a surveyor’s opinion after he’s paid. It’s like the tower of Babel in the Bible. Only we have no great hunter to watch and care. The nations were scattered as speech was confused. It’s still a big world. And people will never stop searching until the end. Hopefully it’s for things worthwhile like skills to be learned, better methods, knowledge to multiply even humble efforts. Though inside I know whether those things are sought or not, greed will be a target. The course will not always be admirable. More often than not man will disappoint you. The center of the Bible has it. “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man” – Psalm 119:9 NIV 1984.
