**“Love Your Neighbor” by Carl Nunnery**

If you was to see a dog pushing a cart with a goose in it, in a normal setting, you would probably have sad thoughts of the goose being the evening dinner! In today’s world it has become a “Dog Eat Dog” Word, there is very little harmony, togetherness, kindness, and above all love for one another!

God has used many examples in the Bible to demonstrate how we are to have love for one another, no matter of:

- Color: ethnic background
- Sex: whether male or female
- Size: tall or short, thin or heavy
- Looks: no matter the different shapes or contours from deformities or medical reasons
- Speech: from unable to talk, other language, to speak defects

God looks beyond all of these to see who you may be from inside your heart! It’s God’s desire that we all love one another. In (Romans 13:9-10) it says, “love your neighbor as yourself,” (vs 10) says, “love does no wrong to a neighbor.”

In (Isaiah 11:6-7) God makes mention of the peaceful existence we should portray, by using animals; (vs 6) wolf live with the lamb, leopard shall lie down with a goat (kid), a calf and lion, (vs 7) a cow and bear shall graze together.

In (Isaiah 65:25) a wolf and lamb feed together, a lion shall eat like the Bull (Bullock). God does not condone the mistreatment of one of his own created beings, whether they be human or animal beings!

In the beginning, God’s creation was the peaceful coexistence of “All” his beings he created, they were in perfect harmony, peacefulness, love, and no fear! This is why Eve in (Genesis 3:1-5) was able to talk to a (asp) or snake. Eve did not sense any harm or danger to be with or around a snake, Satan knew this, so he disguised himself as a serpent to deceive her.

It was from this point Satan was able to affect the order God had created by using our “free choice” on whether or not to believe the lies and deception of Satan!

My friends, remember this, “greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4). We can have God’s intended peace and love for one another, it is within each one of us to do so!!

“Love thy neighbor” (Matt 5:43) no matter who they may be!
