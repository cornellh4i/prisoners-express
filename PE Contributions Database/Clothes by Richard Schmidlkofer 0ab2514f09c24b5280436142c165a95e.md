**Clothes by Richard Schmidlkofer**

My flesh is the clothes of my soul and the Holy Spirit dwells in this flesh.

My flesh is dirty like clothes. They also get dirty, they have spots on them and they have to be washed.

My flesh has sin and it has to be washed by the blood of Jesus, clean us.

These clothes are corrupted and we need new clothes. When Jesus comes back to take us to his kingdom we will have clean, pure, white clothes to honor God in his kingdom.
