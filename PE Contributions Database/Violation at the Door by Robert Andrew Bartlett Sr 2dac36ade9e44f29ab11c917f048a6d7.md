**Violation at the Door by Robert Andrew Bartlett Sr**

Commissioner Smith turned off the lights on his way out the door, but he did not adjust the thermostat. He had lowered the setting of every zone in his house that morning as far as it would go, but the taxpayers paid for the heat in his office so there was no need to ever let it get cold. An old Black man was planting a rosebush next to the front walk. “Good night, Mr. Smith,” he said, looking up only slightly, never making eye contact.

“Good night Jones” the younger man replied curtly.

“Have a nice vacation, sir.” The old man had to raise his voice slightly as the boss man walked in the parking lot, never looking back. Mr. Smith pressed a button on his cell phone. A nearby Lincoln Continental started its engine, turned on the driver’s seat warmer, blinked its lights and tooted its horn.

The Commissioner didn’t like Jones. (He sometimes called him Offender Jones, never Mr.) He was an uppity convict, who’d made a lot of trouble when he maxed out his sentence. He wanted to go home, but he was still worth a lot of money.

That had been over a decade ago, when Mr. Smith had been an overworked, underpaid warden. He remembered discussing Jones’ (he’d been Inmate Jones then) home plan with the program manager and a case analyst in the capitol. The inmate had been locked up for over thirty years, and had no permanent address and no job, so his home plan had not been approved. He was still a good worker, but nobody on the street was trying to hire a laborer at his age with stage 2 cancer, so he was still homeless and expected to die in prison.

The following morning, Mr. Smith left his rented cabin at 9:55 (it had been a long drive, and a respectable man was allowed to sleep in when he was on vacation) and headed up the side of the mountain. He was traveling light. If he hurried, he might still have time to reach the top and get back before nightfall. He didn’t make it.

He spent the night in a cave. There were many caves on the mountain. Two were tourist traps. Most were no more than small holes in the ground. According to his guidebooks, three were excellent sites for serious spelunking, but it didn’t give clear directions to any of them. He’d found this one quite by accident after leaving the trail looking for a shortcut. It was warm and dry out and from the entrance he had a fantastic view of the forest, a beautiful valley, and distant hills.

He had missed the signs warning of “falling rocks.” Well, he had seen one that said “No Trespassing - Unstable Terrain,” but that had only piqued his curiosity. So he had only himself to blame when a tremor in the middle of the night started a slide that almost sealed the mouth of the cave. Still he refused to accept that such things happened randomly to virtuous White leaders like him. He brainstormed a long list of people to blame, including cartographers, book publishers, hiking clubs, and even Offender Jones. He tried to contact Lt. O’Neill and tell him to find out how Offender Jones knew about his vacation, but his cell phone repeated “No Signal.”

Mr. Smith dug for a week. He had enlarged the opening to about two square feet when a rock fell on him, breaking his hip and pinning his leg. A few days later, when he woke up and realized that something had eaten most of his big toe, he knew his own home plan had been canceled.

The next week, Warden Roberts sorted through a large pile of mail and checked the missing Commissioner’s emails. Miss Andrews, a red headed young secretary and said (for at least the tenth time) “something terrible must have happened!”

“Don’t worry about him,” Roberts retorted lackadaisically. “Here, forward this to central records.” He signed off on a recommendation for release of some old-timer named Tom Jones. “And tell Mr. Andrews in Programs that we’re going to need a new gardener.
