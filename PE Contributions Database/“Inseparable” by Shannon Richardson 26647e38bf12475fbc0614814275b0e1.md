**“Inseparable” by Shannon Richardson**

When I was growing up, my sister and I were inseparable. We went everywhere together. We wore the same clothes. We ate the same food. We liked all of the same things.

When we were in school, we would both get in trouble for talking too much. It was hard to focus on the teacher when we were so focused on each other. I would get in trouble, for example, for pulling another girl’s hair, when in reality, it was my sister who did it. No one ever believed it was her. They called me crazy.

My sister was a real practical jokester. She liked to hide things that belonged to our parents. She liked to flicker light switches on and off. She liked to knock things off of shelves. When I would get in trouble, I would tell them it was my sister who did it. They never believed me. They thought I was lying; they thought it was crazy.

The children in my neighborhood didn’t like to play with us. They called us weird. I think they just didn’t like the jokes my sister played on them. She would trip them when they walked by. She would knock them off their bikes when they rode by. She would sneak up behind them and scare them. They would run away when we came around.

I tried to get my sister to behave, but she wouldn’t. She got even worse when we got older. One time in high school, she pushed a girl right down the stairs, and the girl whe was in a cast for a while and couldn’t walk. My sister said she didn’t like her attitude. Of course I was the one who got in trouble for it. No one would believe it was my sister. I got kicked out of school for a while, but my sister never left my side.

My sister finally went too far when I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. I was heartbroken, but my sister was furious. She set his house on fire--with him in it.

No one believed it was my sister who set the fire and not me, so I have been locked away in the state mental hospital since then. My mother said when she was pregnant with me, she was actually carrying twins, but only I survived. She wasn’t able to have any more children.

No one has ever been able to see my sister except for me. But you see her, don’t you? Perhaps you belong here with me.
