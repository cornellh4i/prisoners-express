**Thwarted By Norman Theriot**

In being sentenced to this prison term, I wonder what the sentencing judge may have thwarted. Could he have in fact done me a service in this even going as far as saving my life? Perhaps he even saved others lives, perhaps even many. I’m not only speaking of me here if you are wondering.

In this sentence of such a long term I am thwarted from further pursuing criminal activities out there. I am no longer selling or using drugs nor am I stealing or doing whatever the criminal climent does. I am thwarted from hurting people, including my family even though the event that led me here was painful enough. I am thwarted from possibly putting myself in the grave for GOD knows that was where I was heading.

But at the same time I was thwarted from all of the comforts of home as well as the freedom that we humans so desperately desire. I was taken from a place that I had taken for granted and put in one where I could only think about comfort and love. Where I would learn the true meaning of hardship and despair. Though we humans aren’t meant to be caged, here I am.

I was thwarted from success, now I am in pursuit of renewed freedom. Success was also put off with the hope of survival, if granted then the pursuit of happiness will surely follow. But I wonder, would there be success for me in the absence of this sentence?

In life we humans tend to take everything for granted, even here in the worst of conditions. WIth the world as it is today, we all need to take heed as life from one day to the next is not certain. I think what we need to get the most out of each and every day that we can. We need to concentrate on making the right decisions to afford us a better tomorrow. We are not guaranteed one day to the next, so we need to make the most of the days given to us. Of this it cannot be thwarted or taken from us.
