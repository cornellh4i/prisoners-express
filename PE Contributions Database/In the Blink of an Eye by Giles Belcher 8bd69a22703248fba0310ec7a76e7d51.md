**“In the Blink of an Eye” by Giles Belcher**

So fast that a lot happens, the brain is overloaded or frozen about what is happening. This refers to being put into prison. Honestly, everything snowballed so fast, every second seemed to be a blur. Accusations, finger pointing, lies, and deception resulted. Loss of family, marriage, business, reputation, and freedom has happened.

So many people involved in my case at the beginning, it was very hard to figure out agendas, and who was after the truth. Unfortunately, no one wanted to hear nor present the truth at trial. Lawyers, police, judges, and different agencies aren’t just going to seek truth. Even more so, honest justice from them and the judicial system itself. So many hurdles are put in the way by procedures and people it’s hard to present your case in court.

I’ve been to the law library and even there in the blink of an eye, circumstances can arise to block or discourage the process for freedom. Even so, the truth is there, yet there is a chance for truth and freedom. Just need to get family, friends, and lawyers to do their part. In the Blink of an Eye, freedom, truth, and absolution can result. Those who did wrong and ate wrong will be put to shame, embarrassment, and loss. Only time will tell in this matter.
