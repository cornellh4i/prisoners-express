**“H-Town - Tha D - NYC” by Michael Morales**

I grew up born and raised in Houston, TX, AKA H-Town. Houston is one of the largest cities in America. It’s home to me. Pretty much my whole family is in Houston. Houston is big too. I live in northeast Houston, off of Highway Fifty-Nine north and Aldine mail route. The hood is called High Meadows.

Then I moved to Detroit, Michigan. Really Warren, Michigan. I stayed off of eight mile and Dequinder east side, AKA Tha D. Tha D is straight-up ghetto, I’ve never seen hoods like it. Whole blocks abandoned, some blocks just have one house and that’s a crack house. Cops don’t even come around because people shoot at cops. Downtown Detroit is crazy too, they’ve got big, old, abandoned buildings.

Then I moved to NYC, Staten Island. It’s nothing like NYC. Times Square is just like the movies too, people walking around every which way twenty-four seven. They’ve got projects over there, they don’t really have hoods. They’ve got blocks or buildings they claim depending on where you are. A lot of different people are up there too. But, yeah, I lived in three big cities but there’s nothing better than H-Town - Houston, TX northeast side, Aldine mail route, fifty-nine north!
