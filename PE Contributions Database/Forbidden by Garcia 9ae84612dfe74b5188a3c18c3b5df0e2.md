**Forbidden by Garcia**

‘Tis said that, “True beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” Lust breeds covetousness; the wages of sin is death.

Lips, sweet as honey, speak with a truth as pure as scripture; her laughter a hymn like angels singing.

The tantalizing promise of excitement in her eyes is provoking beyond all moral reasoning.

Deception, betrayal, fear of death, none hold power to blind, or subdue the voracious appetite of the beast that ravenously rages. Ready, waiting, stalking her from the depths of my flesh. Seduction, converts the saint to sinner. God must have known, after he created her.

Ever aware of the gnashing teeth that surround me. Fools, starved for a morsel of bitter misery. A constant eye on the forbidden fruit, yet over my shoulder her master lurks behind me.

Erotic, enticing, elusive, I have been seduced without constent, like a lamb led to slaughter. My sinful desires ought surely end in my demise. Only a taste of her sweet honey would dull the agonizing persecution; momentarily satisfying the beast. You see for however intoxicating it may be, lust is a deception, the fool’s gold of love is tricky business. Blameless temptation quickly becomes deliberate treachery.
