**Winter’s Sentinel by Giles Belcher**

It’s cold, windy but beautiful here. Seeing winter here is exhilarating yet brutal as nature goes. The yak or Dison is beautiful and tranquil standing where it is. Can also be a dangerous and deadly beast. Is the saddle of Indian, Mongel (chinese), Russian (cossack) made? How many winters and miles has it gone through? How long has the beast of burden been waiting? Has life been easy for the animal or has it been harsh? Just a fascinating animal in its environment! Can you survive there and return back to civilization? A wonder and a challenge indeed!
