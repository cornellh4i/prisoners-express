Words give meaning to expression, yet there are many things that words can’t express. I was born in 1983, and as a millennial, I feel this romantic feeling about the southwest. A lot of that comes from my rural upbringing in central Indiana and my Dad’s influence. We went on many vacations to the southwest, and it seems like you can drive toward the mountains in Albuquerque, New Mexico for days. Seeing these buttes hills made me itch to have a day hike, scrambling over rocks and imagining the history seeping out of the earth itself.

In 2000, I couldn’t take it anymore, and I coaxed my brother into exploring the farm roads by Buffalo Gap outside of Abilene. I had no map, food, or flashlight, and of course no compass. All I had in my pack were some platypus collapsible canteens and a nalgene bottle of water. Light and fast was my plan of attack. I had my usual pocket items like a knife and lighter, wallet, etc. We finally spotted a suitable butte to attempt to free climb and parked the Dakota as close to a butte as we thought we could get. It was probably noon or so, and with no compass to shoot a bearing, we speed walked to it and took turns wearing the pack. There were no trails, and so we had to navigate sounds of rattlesnakes, trees, and rocks. Every once and awhile there was some barbed wire. Eventually, we crossed a road, which was funny because we hiked the desert for hours since we didn’t know about the road. Anyway, we made our way to the top and took pictures, but then we realized it was nearly sundown.

The farm road the truck was on couldn’t be seen even if there was a cash prize involved. It would soon be dark, “snake time,” and so we pushed back to the car, which was hard because we didn’t have a compass or flashlights. Suddenly, we knew something was stalking us: footfalls stopping one second after we did. A four legged creature that sounded like a cat with heavier, cautious, and deliberate steps. Then we smelled something like cherry pipe tobacco, and so we announced ourselves since about 60% of Texans have guns. With our knives, we had a fighting chance not to end up like the teens in horror movies, shouting “hello?!” Like it’s a big question with no answer.

Then I heard the action of a long gun, and while I couldn’t tell whether it was a rifle or double barrelled shotgun, I could tell that it posed a threat to my future plans. My brother did what we were always taught not to shout in a home invasion scenario: “I have a gun!” As apprehensive as it made me, the unknown person probably anticipated that hell in advance and planned to shoot first without highlighting his position. We decided that all of that was enough and so we ate cactus pads by a fire and waited out the cold desert night. This was preferable to being eaten or shot. We finally made it back to the road and had to hitchhike. A guy wanted to drop his family off before returning to us, and he came back with a cooler full of pop, no alcohol. After driving for what seemed like a half hour or more, we got back to the Dakota.

They wouldn’t accept our money or apologies for the inconvenience, but they did ask us to never do this again because they were concerned for our safety. I couldn’t say no to such a proposed excitement, but I’d never go into it so unprepared again. I’ve lived through worse, but this all could have been prevented with basic supplies and knowledge of the terrain. My brother and I went back to Abilene, and one dollar McChickens never tasted so good.
