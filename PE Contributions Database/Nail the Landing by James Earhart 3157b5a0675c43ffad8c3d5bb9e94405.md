**Nail the Landing by James Earhart**

My mother was a devoted disciple of child-rearing guru, Dr. Benjamin Spock, who called for lots of sensory stimulation and little corporal punishment. Consequently, my worst behavior resulted in being grounded, not spanked. I hated it. I loathed being confined to an area that limited my range of activities. Time stood still. In retrospect, it was great training for prison, the ultimate grounding.

While some prison reform studies decry “the crippling idleness...which characterize[s] most state systems,” (1) my experience is that most prisoners stay active. Whether it is at the weight bench, the card table, job site or religious service, inmates find ways to keep themselves busy. The weightier problem for me was the grinding sameness of the days, weeks, months and years-- the lack of fresh and meaningful stimuli. Remove the hovering threat of violence, and it was like living an inescapable version of those time-laden, ball-and-chain episodes of my childhood.

My deliverance arrived when Saint Louis University (SLU) offered free on-site theology classes for fifteen inmates at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri. I hesitated to apply at first. I had already been to college. Was it right to seek one of those coveted spots when it would deny someone else that opportunity? The desire for a stimulating new activity won out. I applied and was accepted.

Classes met only once a week, so courses were writing intensive. Weekly readings required essays. This sparked two phenomena, one to do with time, another with “height.” Having deadlines speeds up the clock. Being immersed in a text, choosing a topic, formulating a thesis, and making the argument ate away chunks of the day. Time flew. Then there was the impact of the comments professors wrote on these reflections. At the time classes started, I had been in prison for thirteen years and thought I was dealing well emotionally. But years under the us-them relationship between staff and inmate had taken their toll. The toxic effect of always being judged on past crimes and seldom recognized for current merit had left me starving. To write something and have the words taken seriously by someone with authority was affirming and liberating. Key to any prisoner’s emotional well-being is knowing that “somebody out there loves me.” Over time, it is just as important to know that “somebody sees ME,” not just the prison garb. Those comments provided that recognition and fed a hungry soul. My self perception got a lift. My spirits soared.

During the first few months, emotional need absorbed much of the oxygen in the classroom. The work was challenging; however, and the critical thinking element began to kick in, especially as it was framed in theological thought. The curriculum opened fresh views and demanded reasoned assessment of one’s values and beliefs, as well as one’s role in community. These two aspects of the experience proved valuable as the two-year program neared its end, as I experienced dread at the thought of losing this activity that had so enriched my life.

One particular reading, Man’s Search for Meaning, by Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist interred in the Nazi death camps, hit home. He had observed a difference between the one-in-twenty-six who survived and the ones who perished. Those who gave up expressed the belief that life had nothing left to offer. Survivors “had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.” (2) Rather than fret over my lost stimuli, it was time to lead others in the community to new ones.

SLU has expanded their presence at ERDCC to include an associate of arts degree program, a monthly speaker series, periodic workshops, and a college prep program. I have been blessed to serve as a teaching assistant in the degree program for five of the last seven years. A student-alumni organization that grew out of a small-group communication class in the degree program serves several roles: cheerleader for all things educational, advisory board to the program’s administrative team, and community service organization. The core service is tutoring prisoners who wish to earn a high school equivalency certificate but are excluded from the regular school program because of the length of their sentences. This not only gives men a chance to fulfill that dream, but gives them hope of entry into the college prep and degree programs. The work makes for full and rewarding weeks. Somehow, you can’t give more than you get.

Flying is great, but how and where you land is just as important.
