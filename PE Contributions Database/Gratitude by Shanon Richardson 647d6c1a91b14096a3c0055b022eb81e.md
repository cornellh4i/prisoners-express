**Gratitude by Shannon Richardson**

I will be the first to admit that I was a complete brat before coming to prison. If I wanted something, I bought it, end of story. My ex-husband, David, would get so frustrated with me because I would make a comment about liking something, but by the time he got around to surprising me with it, I had already bought it for myself. The word “gratitude” or “grateful” didn’t exist for me---at all. If something broke, no big deal! I just bought another one. Looking back, I would like to slap the old me and hopefully knock some sense into myself

When I was arrested, life as I knew it ceased to exist. My five sons who were and are my life and my entire world were taken from me, and their father refuses to let me contact them. I gave birth to another son at only 24 weeks (out of 40) due to the neglectful conditions of prison. I never even got to lay eyes on his precious face, hold him, or tell him how much mommy loves him. I woke up from my C-section handcuffed and shackled to the bed without my baby. I was later handed adoption papers. His father didn’t want him and I am nothing but a prisoner in the eyes of the court, so I was not allowed to have an opinion on the matter. The same man who gave my son away (thankfully my now EX-husband) got rid of everything I owned. I will leave prison without even a pair of panties to my name. Everyone I knew and loved abandoned me completely.

If nothing else, prison has taught me to be humble and grateful. That is something I will always carry with me, and no one can take this from me. It makes me so angry and frustrated to see the ungrateful women around me. They get to talk to and see their children and have no idea of the anguish of not being able to. Are they grateful? Nope, they just complain. They have people who care enough about them to help them financially and have no idea how hard it is to survive on the few dollars per month the prison pays. Are they grateful? Nope, they just complain and no amount of money ever seems to be enough. If only they realized that every single one of these things could disappear in the blink of an eye, perhaps they would be more grateful?

In my more positive times, I look at this as a life lesson. In my not-so-positive times, I crumble under the anguish and despair of my current life. But one thing is for certain: the words “gratitude” and “grateful” not only exist for me now, they are some of the most important words in my vocabulary.
