**“The Red Unicorn Arises: Part One” by Matthew Tomlinson**

It wasn’t on my schedule. It wasn’t on my schedule to introduce Rebekah (with that “k”) and the group of young grandmothers who call themselves “the girls” quite yet. But Prisoner Express addicts can enjoy the contrast in this photo. Rebekah, who is about to give me a few pointed words of wisdom, is 36 here. The child walking toward the camera is about 17 or 18 or so. It would be difficult to estimate the age differences by their appearances; wouldn’t it? The distinguishing characteristic is conversation. Rebekah speaks how a grown woman speaks. The photo indicates Rebekah is about to demonstrate to me exactly how a grown woman does speak.

“What possible good is something like that?” Rebekah fumed, “She’s half our age, Tee Dee. What good is she? What good? She’s walking Northline Mall with half of her rump hanging out of her shorts... So what? All of Houston can see what she’s about. So what? What good is she? What good?”

Look over the girl’s right shoulder, to the left part of the photo. You get merely an impression of Peppermint. Peppermint has her back to the camera. The hefty-haunched Latina is out of earshot. She isn’t out of range. Peppermint has seen my head swivel. She took her time approaching the conflict zone. There was a pronounced swagger in her sashay. Peppermint swung that beautiful, bouncing, full-bodied behind as only an abuela can know how to swing it.

“I mean it,” Rebekah ranted. “That girl isn’t an asset. She’s a liability, no matter how you look at it. Come on, Tee Dee, she’s probably Deana’s age. But no daughter of mine would ever walk through Northline Mall with her rump hanging out.”

Peppermint stopped in front of me. Little Emily came to Peppermint’s side. Rebekah remained at my right. Rachel appeared at my left to fully form the semi-circle. The four young grandmothers convened as a petit jury read to, in public, pass judgment upon me for my petty transgression.

Peppermint rubbed my cheek. “Do you know what, girls? Tee Dee must be running a fever. Look at his face. It’s so red.”

Emily rocked forward onto her toes to finger my face in her own investigation. “No, she isn’t hot, Mama Peppermint.”

Rachel raised her eyebrows. She lightly patted my cheek, “Well, no, it’s not his face that’s hot.” She flipped an off-hand gesture toward my crotch. “The poor man’s unicorn blood is stirred up. That’s why his face is so red.”

The four girls twittered lightly at my expense. “Unicorn!” Peppermint echoed. “Do you know what, girls? That’s a good name for him. Tee Dee, for the rest of today, you have to answer to the Red Unicorn. That’s your name today. You’re our Red Unicorn.”

“I mean it, Red Unicorn!” Rebekah raved once more. “What’s something like her good for? She’s showing all of Houston what she’s good for. She’s too young to be worth the price she probably would charge.”

“Girls, let’s not pass judgment on the child,” Peppermint intoned.

“You’re one of us now, Red Unicorn,” Rachel said. “You can’t be doing that blatant windowshopping. Not so blatantly.”

Emily laughed. “Blatantly, yes. Do it behind my back like my husband used to do.”

Rebekah huffed: “Yes, behind my back, like my husband used to do. Next time, Red Unicorn, be discreet. That’s what I’m saying. You’ve got all of Houston to go be a dog. And that’s where you’ll find that girl. She’ll be walking in front of the cheap motels on Airline Drive waiting for you. But whatever else you do, Tee Dee, you treat all four of us girls holy. Holy! That includes respecting me enough to be discreet about that windowshopping, Red Unicorn.”

Peppermint pointed beside her. “Girls? Line up right here in the mall. Red Unicorn, you start with Rachel here, then Emily, then me and then Rebekah. Come around here, Rebekah, besides me.” The four grandmothers fell into place. “Now you go right down the line, Red Unicorn. You give each one of my girls an apology, a kiss, and a hug.”

Rachel looked me up and down. “You have to say the Red Unicorn is sorry. Or the Ex-Unicorn,” she giggled.

There was nothing to it but to do it. “Rachel? The Red Unicorn is sorry for embarrassing you.”

And so the penance was performed. Each of the girls received an apology from the de-horned Red Unicorn. Each woman then restored me to communion by giving me a kiss with a hug.

This was 1998, some 20 years ago. I wonder how that young girl look today. She’d be 38 or so by now. I wonder if her shorts still let everything hang out. Yeah, I’d still look. Bow-Wow-Wow-Yippie-Aye-Yippie-Yea (lyrics to the “Atomic Dog”).

**“Part Two: The Pink-And-Blue Red Unicorn” by Matthew Tomlinson**

This photo of the man staring at the girl’s back brings back a memory. It’s a memory that I almost don’t have. Look, things all work this way. In September 1987, I came to Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) bringing a 10 year old sentence with me. In September 1997, TDCJ released me. In October 2000, TDCJ welcomed me back with a 99 year sentence. I haven’t seen daylight since then, and I never will again. That 37 months “extended furlough” (if you can remember what furloughs were) is all the street time they’ll ever give me.

During these 18 years (and small change) back in TDCJ, I’d almost forgotten the Red Unicorn incident. Peppermint, Rachel, Emily, and Rebekah all still write to me regularly. Someone else also writes from time to time. Prisoner Express mailed me the Summer 2018 Newsletter with this photo. About ten days later, someone put a photocopy of the Newsletter in a manila envelope. They block-printed my name, TDCJ number, and address using a broad-tipped blue marker. In the return address area, they used a pink marker to draw a smiley face. The USPS postmarked the manila envelope from Terre Haute, Indiana.

Enclosed with the photocopied Newsletter was digital artwork. They drew the “My Little Pony” cartoon character. They added a Pink-and-Blue swirling unicorn to the pony. The unicorn itself was fluorescent, flaming red. Atop the horn, as if it were a flagpole, were the crossed flags of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Below this Red Unicorn, in computer-produced Pink-and-Blue block letters, was my KD5CHN ham radio callsign.

Pink-and-Blue, whoever they are, reads Prisoner Express. Pink-and-Blue knew about the Red Unicorn incident. Pink-and-Blue wanted me to write the story, “The Red Unicorn Arises,” for the January 2019 Photo Theme prompt. It wasn’t on my schedule to introduce fellow Prisoner Express addicts to Peppermint and her girls quite yet. Terre Haute rearranged my schedule.

It’s true that this photo is Rebekah and me. But it isn’t. I’m not as tall as this guy. I’m 5 feet, 7 inches (170 centimeters). Back in 1998, when this photo must have been taken, my hair was no more than 4 inches long (102 millimeters). In those spots, my hair would still grow. This guy has a headful of hair (well, in 1978, I had a headful of hair too!). I was spotlessly clean-shaven in the days when this photo was taken. Now, that is one of my shirts. It would’ve been neatly pressed; elsewhere, one of the girls would’ve stripped it off me for ironing. It would’ve been neatly tucked; elsewsie, one of the girls would have tucked it in.

This photo is us. But it isn’t. I know this was 1998 because for the prior 30 years (since 1968 in second grade) I had worn Coke-bottled glasses. The girls had bargained and badgered me, at 38 then, to get my first set of contacts. As you can estimate from the photo, those brand-new contacts worked better than Rebekah would have preferred. Bow-Wow-Wow-Yippee-Aye-Yippee-Yea! (lyrics from the “Atomic Dog”). But that isn’t Rebekah, for she’s my height. Emily is about that much shorter than me. That’s Emily’s height but Rebekah’s general facial features. Then again, the face is not quite Rebekah’s face. The photo is us. Yet, it’s not.

Fellow Prisoner Express addicts, remember the December 2018 photo theme showing the couple in the convertible? You remember my three stories about “The Trinity Project”? The Witch of the Rains explained that situation to me. “You’ve had moments when you were writing, for example. You were briefly distracted – maybe you paused to open a Dr. Pepper can. Then, when you returned to your writing, you completely forgot what you intended to write. "Your mind was completely blank,” La Bruja de La Lluvia illustrated. “The couple in the convertible had such a moment. For several seconds, each of them forgot who they were, what they were doing, everything. Their minds went blank,” La Viajera instructed. “For several seconds, we were them,” The Lady Traveler summarized. “Then, we were not.”

In the December 2018 Photo Theme, we were the couple in the convertible… then, we weren’t. In the January 2019 Photo Theme, the photo was us… but it wasn’t.

All right. This is Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit. I can relate all that to the “Major Psychiatric” part of the name. They’ve had me in segregation for 3½ years for now. I almost never leave my cell. So, the Witch of the Rain manifests herself to me; right? Nobody else discerns La Bruja de La Lluvias, right? The Lady Traveler comes to me in my dreams, right? La Viajera, while I sleep, transports me from Amarillo to places like Trinity Site down in East Texas, right? Yeah, I can relate all of that to 3½ years of segregation. It’s all a figment; right?

Where, then, does The Pink-and-Blue Red Unicorn fit into that sigment?
