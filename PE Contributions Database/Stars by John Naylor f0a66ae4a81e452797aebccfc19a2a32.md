**Stars by John Naylor**

When I was growing up, my grandma on my mom’s side always praised my talents. We called her Mamau. The last letter is a “u” as in university. The praises of Mamau and my momma couldn’t get me focused on being a star though. I remember school plays: the audience was always messing my mode up. I’d never been on stage before, and I hadn’t anticipated so many expressions. I suddenly realized some performances in various areas of talent would be especially difficult. I didn’t focus on using all the talents God gave me. As I got older, I had problems and difficulties with unique challenges in life. If I put my back into it, I could’ve been an honor roll student again. I could have impressed girls with various talents. My view of the world, society, and so many things are different. When I have no privacy, some see or hear my talents or are blessed by them in some way. Even volunteering as a personal ministry is a talent.

You my readers, my captive audience, receive talent coming out as I receive yours. Sometimes I wonder how it would’ve been to focus on popularity in high school and college as I had in grade school. Who knows, I may have gotten famous. I turned down sports scholarships, too. Looking back, I think maybe it was foolish. There were upsides to a zealous focus on popularity or fame. I just got burnt out on others’ views and immaturity and tired of being mad or of being socially acceptable as society expects.

Here I get a positive letter. My mom who lost about 200 pounds is getting a lot of attention or fans from it. She was so popular when she was younger. Also, she always wanted a family so she got what she wanted and more. However, I’m sure it felt good to feel like a star again. I told her she’ll be a YouTube celebrity if she’s not careful. I always barked at people when whining about inability. “Just stop it and do what it takes!” Maybe for them, it’s a ketogenic diet. Maybe you finally sing a song that someone can hear. A *MADtv* skit once said, “Remember, keep looking to the stars ‘cause you’ll never be one.” Tell the haters that and flex that you made one this week. That’s a challenge.
