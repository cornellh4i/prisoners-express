**"Road Trips" by William Miles**

I own my own cargo ship, carries only three hundred thousand cubic foot, but my ship Vicki's Venture 14 is only for ships in nearby orbit to way station 3 only a quarter a light-year my trip one way take anywhere from one hour to three days, though it's more properly a space lane, my ship is mostly automated, my computer Zy-crol an A.I. I am still needed more as an A.I. psychiatrist thana pilot.

Once I was a perimeter defense pilot, what you may call a “fighter pilot” this is my third clone body, so since I have no more I decided to slow it down being male I am less according to Zylonian belief I am not that which bear so I can not be considered of giving life, so if I want to pay 300 thousand credits that I can, I may upon the counsels “aye” have another clone.

The Zylonians have their own road trip all their home worlds have no unnatural structures, nor any cut roads since it is the height of sacrilege to erect on cut open or in Zylor, so I spend most of my time among the stars, guiding Vicki 14 while she narrates, the various stellar phenomena, gas clouds light years across.

I have plenty of time to think in my 225 years of life I have been through much and seen innumerable years, 225 years to a Zylonian is considered their pre teen years, so to deal with my lifespan, I attend frequent couch sessions of Vicki’s counseling personality (not program) I’ve had only 30 children which is small really, in spite of many technological advancements, death is still common Earth is mostly abandoned, over-mined, and also mostly denuded, 93% of ozone depleted and though Zylonians, technology has advanced to it pinnacle and can develop no further, They refuse to assist in transforming, Earth “cannot repair what is destroyed,” is the reply of “She who dwells sesth The Mountain,” so enjoy Earth while you can with your strip mining pollution of water, radioactive waste and destruction of your atmosphere only choice few survive, think politically my friends, for how many can afford, the 200 plus for space vacation, in the 2 thousand, since this message was sent back 678 years I expect some corruption of data.
