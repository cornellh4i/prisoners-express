***Parole* by D.J. Forbes**

It was a cold and drizzly morning the day I was to parole.

I’d been awake for some time before they came to escort me to R&R for processing. Laying there, I contemplated my past.

The fact is that I screwed up my life and the lives of some others. While there was only one direct victim to my crime, indirect victims abounded. I had hurt so many people through my selfish actions, many of whom I love, that I deserve this prison term.

But you know what? That was then, and this is now. I am no longer the person I used to be.

I’d spent the last 15 years sifting through the wreckage of my life, salvaging what little good there was and discarding the rest. The funny part is that doing so turned out to be the easiest part of my transformation process. The hardest part was developing the traits of strength, integrity, and honesty in an environment as negative as prison.

I had though! Otherwise, the board wouldn’t have found me suitable for parole.

Now that the day arrived, I found my excitement mixed with trepidation. For fifteen years, my life has been on hold while the world continued on without me. This new world of advanced digital devices and social media was alien to me, and I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect.

It wasn’t like I had anyone to guide me through this time. Both my parents had passed away, I’d lost contact with all my friends over the years, and neither of my ex-wives wanted anything to do with me. In fact, my first ex-wife denied me contact with my only daughter on the grounds that I’d broken too many of the commandments.

But if there’s one thing prison has shown me, it’s that with the proper mental attitude, you can adapt and overcome anything. So while some people might feel hopeless in my situation, I saw it simply as an opportunity to achieve, not that it would be easy!

When my escort came to get me, I grabbed the clear trash bag containing the few possessions I was taking with me, took one last look around, and headed out. The drizzle of the early morning had since turned into a downpour.

Walking through the rain on my last day in prison, I couldn’t besmirch my time here. The way I see it, prison probably saved my life and kept me from hurting more innocent people. It gave me the opportunity to take a close look at my life and to then transform myself into the person I’ve always wanted to be.

Arriving at R&R, I was put into a holding cell all by myself. I guess I was the only one lucky enough to be paroling today. The R&R sergeant took pity on me and let me change into my dress outs right away instead of making me sit there soaked. I thanked him for his kindness.

My processing went quickly enough, and I soon found myself back in the holding cell. While I had encountered the “hurry up and wait” phenomenon over 30 years ago in the army, time didn’t lessen the levels of frustration that accompanied it.

After two hours, I asked what the delay was. I was told they had received a call informing them that my ride was delayed by the weather. Ride? I was under the impression I’d just be loaded on a Greyhound and sent on my way.

As time continued to slowly crawl by, I sat there trying to stay relaxed and keep my thoughts calm. Truth be told, I had this paranoid thought that this was all a joke, that shortly they would come up to the bars of the holding cell and yell, “Psych!” They would then change me back into my blues and escort me back to my yard while laughing at my naivete of thinking they’d actually let me out after what I did.

Knowing that I was my own worst enemy at times like this, I breathed and let things go and focused instead on my dreams and hopes for the future. On top of that list was finding my daughter to discover whether or not she wanted me back in her life. Unfortunately, I had no idea where to start, and I didn’t know what her mom may have told her. Part of my motivation for change was the desire to become someone she could be proud of, and until I knew otherwise, I would continue under the assumption she might want me back in her life; I had to keep a positive mentality.

After what seemed an eternity, I was informed that my ride arrived and that it was time to go. Standing up straight, I grabbed my things and headed out to begin a new chapter in my life.

My escort walked me in silence to the salle port. He pointed to a car outside the fences, identifying it as my ride. I could dimly see someone sitting in the driver’s seat, obviously staying out of the rain.

Passing through the final gate, I made my way toward the parked car. As I approached, the driver’s side door opened and an umbrella popped open sheltering the driver from the chill rain. I stopped a respectful distance away. When the driver stood, I stared in shock at a face I hadn’t seen in 15 years. Luckily, the pouring rain hid the tears now streaming down my face as I heard the words I longed to hear: “Hello Daddy.”
