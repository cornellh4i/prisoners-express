***Baby Girl Miranda in the Rain* by Matthew Tomlinson**

There was no need to ask Abbey Red which vehicle was hers. Her fire-engine red pants suit and flaming red glasses were indicia of reliability. “Go ahead and get out of the rain. Let me check out your Jeep’s rear end!” Extra steps gave a clear sightline of the blood-red vehicle’s bumper.

Abbey Red’s attention was distracted by Main Street traffic for a fast moment. It was a telling moment. “Come on, wise guy, before the rain gets serious.”

“Quite a coincidence,” I remarked while getting out of the mist. On cue, moderate rainfall began spattering on the windshield. “You’re rightfully proud of your ham radio call sign, but you don’t have the AB5RED vanity license plate.”

She shrugged it off. “Is it easier to go up North Main to get to your house?”

“It’ll give us a chance to pass by that bus stop and look.” My mind began counting cars on the train of coincidences. “Quite a coincidence that I met Dee Gee on the bus yesterday. By an unlucky coincidence, Dee Gee will catch that Blue Bird bus back to prison. He promised to send me a Korean girl.”

She patted my knee. “Second generation, yes. You’re two months younger than me, baby boy! I don’t mind being your Korean girl, but you’re my Baby Boy!”

My train of thought moved onward to the next car in the train of coincidences. “Princess told you about the stunt she pulled when she threw the baggie in my lap to entrap me. By coincidence, you told me in the restaurant that you’re no longer a peace officer. When I showed you Joker Box 31, you said your problems are an order of magnitude more serious than entrapment.”

She patted my knee again. “Princess told me her dark, drizzle story. You caught the entrapment on video. She has to give you some sex to get the video. Hey, who entrapped who? Princess’ word is good. You took a rain check? Princess will pay.”

“By coincidence, when we came out of the restaurant, there was a very young woman standing across Main Street, under her umbrella, watching. You’re a trained observer. You saw her watching us.”

“She was very young, wasn’t she? We need to call her something. We’ll call her Baby Girl. She was indiscrete. I trained my children not to stare.”

“Give it up! Who you riding with? Federal Bureau of Investigations? Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives? Immigrants and Customs Enforcement?”

Abbey Red made the right turn onto Airline Drive. “Yes, I’m with Homeland Security, but I’m on administrative leave while they investigate me. I shot someone important. No, I don’t know who Baby Girl really is. She might be one of my children from Homeland Security, but maybe not.”

“Is this ‘Spy versus Spy’ from MAD magazine?

“No. A federal grand jury might have indicted me. Baby Girl might be watching so they can plan when to arrest me.”

“There’s a U.S. Supreme Court case, *Miranda v. Arizona*.”

“An ex-cop knows her Miranda rights.”

“Your first Miranda warning is most important. You have the right to remain silent. Don’t tell me anything.”

Abby Red sighed. “It’s headline news; all America knows.”

“Your second Miranda warning amplifies the first. Anything you say will be used against you. When the U.S. Attorney questions me, I’m snitching! Quick, fast, and in a hurry!”	“Humph! What a friend you are, Baby Boy!”

“If you tell me nothing, then I can’t snitch.”

Abbey Red made the connection. “My Miranda rights can really rain on Government’s parade.”

“Government is raining on yours. You’ve got an umbrella like Baby Girl had. Your umbrella is *Miranda v. Arizona*.

She laughed lightly. “Baby Girl might be named Miranda.”

“Baby Girl might be holding Miranda, the umbrella. Better than being left holding the bag.”

“Baby Girl Miranda in the rain, yeah. What a picture that makes.”
