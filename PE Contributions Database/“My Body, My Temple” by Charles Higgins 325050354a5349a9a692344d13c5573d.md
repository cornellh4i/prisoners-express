**“My Body, My Temple” by Charles Higgins**

My body is my temple. My temple is sacred. Grown and defined with age, since the day it was created. It is where my heart is housed, that endows a never ending love for my Creator.

My mind is where I think. It is where I can ponder, how to serve such a mighty Creator more accurately. A Creator, whom gave me a brain to decipher right from wrong. Righteous from unrighteous.

To serve, I must do my best to remain healthy and abled. I’m not talking about ailments out of my control, I’m talking about protecting my temple and keeping it clean inside and out. All the dire warnings of everything I ingest and inhale, that will fail me inside and desecrate my temple. My creator’s creation that I should value. If I rely on improprieties, well then that is as equatable as believing in false idols.

Fighting must be limited to only protecting my temple. To scar and mar the outside structure shows a lack of love and respect to my Creator and His creation. May the King of Kings forgive me for ever defacing my temple, before I was truly aware.

How could I hurt, damage, or even ruin something so beautiful as my Creator’s creation. No, I should always remain showing my appreciation, and keep my temple presentable at all times. My temple is my body, a house of love for my higher power.
