**“Flowers” by Matthew Ellington**

When I think of a flower, I cannot help but be drawn to the many ways that it capitulates it’s essence to a woman. Perhaps this revelation is expounded by my current environment, devoid as it is of not only femininity, but the Earth’s natural beauty as well. But please, mistake not my observation for lustful longing. My words here embody only the highest respect for the idea of beauty.

Consider the aesthetic visage of a woman- does not she mirror a rose before her petals are open to blooms? And when she does bloom, she speaks as to the origin of life, for could not we exist anymore without her opening to the sun then lest our own mothers had not opened to release us into existence?

There is a softness, a sensuality, in this connection, yet it holds power and strength as well. A woman has the ability to be as gentle and delicate as the skin of any rose, yet tough as a desert cactus. She can thrive in the most harsh of climes, like any exotic wildflower, yet we have a desire to protect her, to care for her and guard her like the rarest of orchids. Her dichotomy is a force, like nature itself.

Like so many things, I fear that we have disconnected ourselves largely from this awareness of beauty. We take for granted the dwindling gardens and meadows, displaced by society’s less-than-organic machinations, just as we seem to subjugate the female form and adulterate all that makes it beautiful. Can you truly appreciate nature’s design even as you tear away roots to build artificial structures that supplant Earth’s natural beauty? How can we justify the way our women are sexualized, demoralized, and made lackluster in place of all that they naturally are?

As a father or two young, developing girls, I pray that they can come of age in a world that still recognizes and respects the beauty of a flower.

“They say roses are red

And violets are blue

But nothing is as splendid,

As a woman’s magnificent hues.”
