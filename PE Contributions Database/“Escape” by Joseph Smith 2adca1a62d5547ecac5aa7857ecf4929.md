**“Escape” by Joseph Smith**

Am I

Who

Am I

Faceless

And androgynous

Chained by labels

Captured by your definitions

Apprehend me with your distinctions

Discriminate my essence and drag me

Relentlessly through all time and place because

My incarceration quells your fear that

I may be unknown and

Unknowable and unplaceable perhaps

I’m unspeakable and

Formless yet

Truth

Seeking release

Through your materiality

By your immaterial imprisonment

Constructed by that which deconstructs

Analyzing and discerning all

Transcendence at last

Experiencing finally

Who

I Am

Who

I Am
