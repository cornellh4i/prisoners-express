For this article I did a little thinking because I only took my notes from the theme writing project on practical jokes, and expanded that story. As for laughter I will be writing about my views of humor and the joking relationship the police have. Concerning their lack of sympathy. Primarily with me being a productive member of society and law abiding citizen. I was placed in prison for the death of my daughter. As for the police/government I think it amuses them. At times some of the staff actually laugh in my face. As I seek ways to better myself, I’m told it’s not possible. This to me is a joking relationship. This costs my family years of my life, and my daughter is gone. I’ve been placed in prison’s rough environment. I do my best to survive this environment and to make amends for the pain and loss I cost my family, with little help from the police/government since they have lied at times and ignored my pleas for help.
