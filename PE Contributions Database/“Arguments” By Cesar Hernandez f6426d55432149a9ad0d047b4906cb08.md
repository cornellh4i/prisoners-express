**“Arguments” By Cesar Hernandez**

Think back to the last time someone criticized you. Did you start an argument? Perhaps it came from a family member, coworker, or friend. Perhaps it was totally unexpected and stung you bitterly. Perhaps even your reaction was unexpected in its harshness, pain, or grief.

We understand that we are not perfect. The criticism you received may have been accurate, and even if it was inaccurate, you can grow from the experience.

If you have had difficulty accepting criticism, ponder how you will react to such words in the future. People can use criticism or praise to mold you, but your attitudes toward both must be healthy.

When you are criticized, for the moment disregard whether it is valid. Disregard the temperament or tone of the critic. Instead, prepare yourself by thinking, “Could this be true?” Then respond in a most disarming fashion; “thank you very much. I appreciate what you’ve said, and I’ll consider it. Do you have any other suggestions on how I can improve?”

When you meet criticism with humility, you reveal your teachability. You won’t need to change every time, but occasionally, you will receive vali criticism. A humble heart and receptive spirit can transform a potentially ugly abrasive moment into lasting polish.
