**“Peace In The Coming Regin” by Juan P. Rosales**

It was impossible not to stop. With all the chaos in a so-called civilized world, the whispering serenity of the dock view lulled my inner turmoil and spelled a siren song to my being. My everything. So mesmerized was I, before my buzzing senses realized I was standing at the very edge of chaos and at the beginning of something enchanting, beautifully new. New to me, although around long before my distant ancestors leaped and morphed. Tell, what else to do but sit and enjoy the simple, unattainable splendor of this moment. Of this peace. Of nature.

The slumbering mirror beneath me stirred before the dancing zephyr. That gentle being appeared seduced by the same siren song as i and frolicked from the mounts to where I sat upon the dock pirouetting coquettishly. I leaned back, calloused palms on soft, weathered wood, my upper body arched against the caressing zephyr as my head tilted to the clear sky with closed eyes. *Sigh* Bliss. Acceptance. Found then lost in the merriment.

So lost was I, time brought the by-and-by. No more clear sky. But now, a forebondance of clouds. A spillover of man’s chaos? … Hmm … My eyes came upon my hand trailing a lazy finger on the etched maze of the dock. Like the wood I, too, am weathered and steeled. My resolve to wait sitting for the coming storm.

The edge of chaos is no more. It reigns. But I shall have my peace because peace is not the absence of conflict or chaos. It is control during the storm.
