**"The Dream" by Kevin Vorshak**

The man in black held him. Unable to resist, Ethan found it hard to breathe with his face buried in the coarse folds of the black uniform. The man’s hands enveloped in white latex gloves felt cold against his skin. Ethan felt the left hand shift chillingly to his neck, grasping in a barely restrained choke hold. The man in black then pulled away and twisted Ethan’s face to where their eyes were mere inches apart. Ethan wanted to resist, but the man in black’s eyes transfixed him.

Brown eyes.

Cold.

Familiar.

He jerked awake. Darkness filled the cell. He heard the rhythmic breathing of his cellie. A toilet flushed from the nearby restroom.

Almost never did he experience such vivid dreams. Yet those eyes stayed with him, practically hovering in the darkness. They were his eyes. He played it over and over in his head trying to make sense of it.

Pounding on his locker jarred him. “C’mon Harris! I’d’ve thought you’d been awake.”

Ethan looked up to glimpse officer Trotman’s smirk as he moved on.

“Idiot,” Ethan heard his cellie say.

“Sorry Perkins.”

“Not your doing, Ethan. Bet you’re gonna miss that.”

“I’m not going to miss any of it.”

“Not even me?” Perkins asked.

Ethan sat up and regarded him. Perkins lay flat on his back with his hands tucked under his head. “Even at my wife’s absolute worst, she’s a beauty queen when compared to you.”

“It ain’t my looks you’re gonna miss. It’s my engaging personality and witty comebacks.”	“You left out your uncanny ability to fart at will.”

“Bet that’s something your wife can’t do,” Perkins said while letting one fly.

“Thank God for that. Dang Perkins,” Ethan said as he shifted to the side, placed his feet on the floor and leaned back against the block wall. His mind drifted back to the dream. Somewhere along the range someone coughed.

“What’s up Harris? You seem pretty glum for a guy who’s going home.”

“Nah, just thinking about a dream I had.” Ethan recounted the dream.

“Hmm,” Perkins said, “sounds to me like you’re scared.”

“I’m not scared.”

“Ok, then it’s prophetic and you’re gonna join ISIS.”

“Why would I join ISIS?” Ethan asked.

“To prove me wrong when I say you’re scared.”

Ethan smiled, “scared’s pretty strong.”	“Nervous then.”

“I cannot accept that.”

Perkins rolled onto his side and propped his head with his hand. “You know, the world gets suddenly big outside that fence.”

“You getting philosophical on me now, Perkins?”

“Just sayin’. Neighbors’ll all be staring at you. You’ll have to explain to potential employers over and over where you been the last fifteen years. Your family will have to adjust their lives to include you. All those natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and floods.

“We don’t have earthquakes or floods.”

“Tornadoes then.”

“I hope your next cellie doesn’t shower. Ever.”

Perkins laughed. “You’ll be fine.”
