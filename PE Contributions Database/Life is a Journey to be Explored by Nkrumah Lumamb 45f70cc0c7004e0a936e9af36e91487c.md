**Life is a Journey to be Explored by Nkrumah Lumamba Valier**

My life has been a journey I am still on, learning from every experience I go through in life. I’ve always seemed to survive through the worst things that could happen to someone. I somehow got enough strength to pick myself up and keep on moving forward.

Though there have been more bad times than good times in my life, I just close my eyes during the bad times and remember the good times. Mentally and emotionally it can be a struggle just trying to make it from one day to the next. It can feel like climbing up a mountain in 20 below weather with no coat or boots on. Snow keeps falling and ice covers the ground. It’s so cold, I can’t feel my feet anymore and my body is so cold, but I have to keep climbing if I am to ever make it to the other side of the mountain. I never look back or down because it only reminds me of what I have to relive if I fall.

I know that once I reach the top of the mountain on the other side it will be much better for me. A much better place that I have been in life and where I am now. I can’t give up no matter how difficult it may get on this journey. Suicide I’ve thought about a few times. I’ve gotten so tired I’ve just wanted to give up. But I did not give in to that thought. I am almost there, I can see the top of the mountain, it’s an opening in a cave just a little further. I am looking through it and I can see the other side where I am trying to get to. All I have to do is hold on and never lose focus on where it is I am trying to get to in my life.
