**“Life Styles” by Carl Nunnery**

Going out to a bar, indulging in drinks and music have become a way of life for many people; they go there for many reasons:

- To get out of the house
- To drink away problems
- To play pool
- To dance for music
- Looking for sex
- To meet people
- They work there
- For fights

Some spend so much time there in one bar or another that they have become known as “regulars.” The only thing regular about going to bars beside making the owners rich is that nothing positive comes from going to them. On the other hand many negatives come from going to bars such as:

- You lose your money
- You get into fights
- You get drunk
- You try to drive drunk
- You don’t spend time with family
- You meet the wrong kind of people
- You end up in jail
- You go home and cause family arguments

Let’s face it: drinking alcohol, whether beer or liquor for mixed drinks, is consumed for its effects it has on the body which can act as a

- Depressant
- Stimulant
- Impairment

Drinking can cause disorientation, enebrated, slurred speech, even uncontrolled bodily functions and blurred vision!

The reason they choose the bar is because everyone there is also there for the same or similar reason, mainly to drink!

Many blame it on all kinds of reasons as previously listed, but it comes down to the life-style they have chosen for themselves to live! They have chosen to go to the bar and drink for their problems instead of going to the Church and the Bible!

Never has or will we ever find,

Love, happiness, answers, and forgiveness from a drink!

Seek a new direction in your life! Seek God!
