**The Goat-Smelling Monkey Peeves The Silver Pixie by Matthew Tomlinson**

Gary gave us “The Zoo'' for our July 01, 2017 word cute. He paired that with the photo theme of the man transforming into a monkey. Coincidences abound. Right here on Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit, right here in their windowless cells of Expansion Cell Block, right here on I-Pod (or Idiot Pod), we indeed do have one individual who calls himself Goat-Smelling Monkey. Prisoner Express readers deserve to read this quite true story of how Goat-Smelling Monkey peeved a woman we’ll call The Silver Pixie. Just because we do live in the zoo does not mean we must play the role of animals. Further on this compilation, PE readers will find the sequel “The ISIS Process: Breaking Ice Ain’t Nice” for the picture theme. I think that only prisoners will truly see the parallels within these stories.

The Witch Of The Rains often appears to you in the guise of someone you wouldn’t expect. Recognize It When You See it. La Bruja De La Lluvias is inherently present when you’d think she wouldn’t be. The Lady Traveler came to my I-Pod in the form of a silver-haired woman with a fresh pixie haircut. I’d seen her when I had my heart attack, but I had other things on my minder rather than learning her name. La Viajera was simply identified as The Silver Pixie.

My Cohorts let me know a woman was in the area. “She's good!” cackled Goat-Smelling Monkey, my neighbor. “Yeah, she's really good! She fade dat ham! Git out dere, I-Pod! Drop out! She ain’t trippin’!”

The silver pixie trapped at the plastic window of my solid steel door. “Are you alright this morning? Did they get that problem straightened out with your heart medication?’

I’d been sitting on the floor, using my mattress-free steel bunk as a writing desk, keeping my back to the door. I wasn’t in the mood to get burned by my cohorts across the hall in the odd-numbered cells. Out of 68 prisoners in the zoo called Idiot Pod, probably 30 of them would be vigorously maturbating to entertain the Silver Pixie. “I’m fine.” Getting up from the floor took an extra few seconds. “The lawyer got those people on Medical to act right. They bring everything the cardiologist ordered.”

The Silver Pixie frowned. “That’s good. It’s a sorry situation when you have to get a lawyer just to get your medication.”

I had to be careful where I looked. “Yeah, it was really a sorry situation.” It was a sorry situation that my cohorts acted like monkeys in the monkey house.

The Silver Pixie nodded. “Call me if you need anything.” She moved along.

Goat-Smelling Monkey shouted: “I need sumfin!” He stood on a stack of books to display his penis in his cell door window. “An’ you need dis cock!”

“Put it up,” warned the Silver Pixie.

“Shut up, bitch! You wants dis cock! Das why you works here, ‘caws yuh wants Goat-Smellin’ Monkey tuh put dis cock in yer life!” That’s an attribute of Administrative Segregation. We’re locked in the cell all day long. Nobody can interact with Goat=Smelling monkey to adjust his asinine attitude. Be All You Wanna Be.

The Silver Pixie pronounced sentence. “Roses are red. Violets are blue. If you act like a monkey. Then you’ll look like one, too. Now put it up.”

“Shut up, bitch!”

“Breaking Ice Ain’t Nice,” warned Silver Pixie. “You’ll read all about it.”

After about an hour the Legal Mail Man came to the cell of Goat-Smelling Monkey. “Are you Offender Whistledick? Dorian Whistledick? That you? Alright; I’ve got a Legal Mail for you from the Texas Attorney General.” The Legal Mail Man made a show of opening sealed envelopes, then flourishing the paperwork to Goat-Smelling Monkey. “Alright, Offender Whistledick. Thank you.”

“Man! Naw, das bullshit!” screamed Goat-Smelling Monkey. “Dey caint do dat! Das bull shit! Naw!

Another cohort sympathized. “Man, you already know. Texas Attorney General doan send no letter except one reason, You getting’ sued for back child support, Dorian? How much?

“Naw, dass bullshit!” wailed Goat-Smelling monkey. “Dey took all muh money off the Trust Fund. I ain’t got nuthin’ left, and dey put a hold on my account, so any money I gets goes tuh dem. Man, it’s fourteen thousand dollahs!”

A third cohort summed things up. “That ho puts a curse on you, Goat-Smellin’ Monkey. She say you gonna’ read all about it. Den you gits dat. Dat ho puts a curse on you.”

A sanctimonious fourth cohort had to toss a jlbe at the Goat-Smelling Monkey. “Damn Fool you was. Man, you should a been doin’ all dat jackin’ when you’s in udh world. Dat way you ain’t have all dat child support. Damn fool.”
