**“Sisters” by Mark Adam Peirano**

Even though one of you two was slightly taller, I remember you both as our tallest twins. You both looked so much alike, I never loved one of you more than the other. In my childhood you both stood so tall over me, unmistakable beacons in all our lives. Your light skin turned golden with the setting or rising sun. Rain didn’t seem to affect either one of you, as you would only bow slightly to each other, even in the strongest gales. The majesty of sisterhood, personified.

When I was young, and then again when I was older, you always welcomed me home. In fact, you two sisters were often the first to be seen when anyone came, and the last to be seen when anyone departed, always so kind, so stable, so welcoming, you two.

I don’t know which of you started it, but you two always got attention, starting when that man from France did his high-wires act with you. Even though you two were never even listed as “extras” in the films you were in, I know one of you at least loved the limelight; if not both of you, but you two would never tell. You always let the others have all the action in those films, you two just hammed it up in the background, acting as normal bystanders in many of what are now starting to be called old movies. (Now that I’m older I would like to think you wouldn’t mind if I just called them classics, as that helps me put a spin on becoming older myself.)

I remember it sounded so odd when a friend called to tell me that one of you was on the news, so I tuned in to see what had happened. Sure enough, there you two were, as inseparable as ever, even though I could see on the news that one of you had been hit and was injured; you both stood together. Emergency workers rushed about trying to prevent further damage and injury, each coming to your aid. Sisters together, through good and bad.

I can recall wondering to myself - how anyone could have not seen you two on such a clear and bright September day, as you both were so… well, obvious. What a crazy accident … at least that was the news. That news story didn’t last long though, and neither would our innocence, as I watched on live-TV another crash - and now both of you were injured in the same way. As I saw the flames of the second crash my mind realized in a flash - this is no accident. Horror. Fear. Terror.

I was naive, for sure, at that moment, as I comforted myself with the notion that you two could still be rescued and restored to your twin majestic glory after some “healing” and “recuperation”. Then one of you fell down, and then I knew things would never be the same. Then, as if in sadness over the first loss, the other fell. Sisters to the end, now immortal in memories, in classic movie scenes, and in our hearts; Sisters. Towers. Innocence. All lost. Eighteen years ago - 9/11/01.
