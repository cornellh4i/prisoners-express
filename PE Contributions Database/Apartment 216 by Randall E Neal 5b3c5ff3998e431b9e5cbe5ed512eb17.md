***Apartment 216* by Randall E. Neal**

“What the…?” Sara stares through the chilled rain like she just saw a ghost. “That guy looks just like me! But how? No, it couldn’t be. Impossible. They told me he died when we were four years old, and that was 16 years ago. Wouldn’t I remember going to my twin brother’s funeral?” Sara stares at the young man, turns, and begins to follow him. She’ll miss her midterm exam if she doesn’t go to class, but right now, she doesn’t care. She always felt like her brother was still alive.

They say that identical twins can feel each other. Sara began to feel her brother the day she moved into Apartment 216. Is this just my imagination running wild? The young man enters an apartment building. Sara follows him upstairs yet walks past him, noticing the number on the door he is unlocking: 216. “This is weird,” she tells herself.

“What now? Should I knock on his door and ask him if he is Jimmy Callahan? If he’s not, he’ll probably think I have a crush on him and am trying to meet him.” As Sara stands there swirling ideas through her brain, she decides to go outside and check the name on the mailbox. As she’s looking down the row of brass colored mailbox doors, she sees 216. Just her luck, no name. Her mind wanders off.

“Excuse me, ma’am,” a man says. Sara, startled at first, realizes it’s the mailman.

“Oh, sorry,” she replied as she looked down in his hand. “Jimmy! Jimmy what? Move your hand,” she’s thinking. The mailman looks puzzled.

“Are you ok?”	“Uh… yes of course. Do you know if Jimmy Callahan still lives in 216?” Sara decides to play dumb.

The mailman smiles and looked at the envelope. “This says Jimmy Swanson.” Sara thanks him, turns, and walks away.

She finally pushes the crazy notion out of her head and hurries back to class in time for the test. As she sits at her desk, she hears, “Times up! Turn in your papers.” Her mind snaps back into reality, and she turns in a blank paper. Her mind must have been in Apartment 216. For the next several days, she leans against the outside wall of the young man’s apartment building, hoping to see him again. It’s like he disappeared.

Today, it is raining again. As Sara stands there under her umbrella, she is shocked once more. The young man is no more than 10 feet away and heading straight for her. Her heart feels as though it is going to leap out of her chest. He stops right in front of her and smiles. They stare one another up and down: definitely twins.

Sara knew without even asking. Tears filled her eyes. “They told me you were dead, but I could feel you.”

“They told me the same thing, but I knew better since I could feel you too,” the young man smiled.

“Oh Jimmy, Jimmy! I can’t believe it’s true!” Sara shouts out as she throws her arms around him. Suddenly, she feels hair. Hair? Yeah, lots and lots of hair. Her eyes open and her fuzzy cat Jake is cuddled in her arms. Sara cries.

For two days, Sara cries, not leaving her apartment. Here, here in 216, she can feel him. “God, let me know the truth! Where is my brother?” Finally, on the third day, Sara decides to og back to the apartments where she had followed the young man and to knock on Apartment 216. It’s raining again, and so Sara grabs her umbrella, opens it, and steps out into the pouring rain.

Immediately, her heart stops beating. Drenched to the bone, the young man is leaning on the outside wall of her apartment building without an umbrella. Sara pinches herself hard: ouch!

Smiles spread across their rain soaked faces as they stand there staring one another up and down.

“Are you Jimmy Callahan?” Sara asked.

“Yes, are you Sara Callahan?” Jimmy asked.

“Yes. Well, it’s Sara Perkins now. My foster parents adopted me and gave me their last name.”

“Yeah, mine too. It’s Jimmy Swanson now.”

“I’ve been going to your apartment building every day after the first time I saw you. You never came home while I was there.”

Sara explained, “That’s because I was standing here everyday waiting to see you again. I followed you all the way to your apartment the first time I ever saw you leave the college. Apartment 216, right?” Jimmy asked.

“I followed you to your apartment also. I felt like you were with me when I saw you enter your apartment, right?” Sarah smiled.

“Yeah, I felt the same way when I saw you go into yours.”

They stood and hugged in the pouring rain. “I imagine that. Twins separated for sixteen years, finding one another a mere 12 blocks apart.” The door closed behind them as they entered into apartment 216.
