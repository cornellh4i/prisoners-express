**“Tendrils of Energy” by Jeremy Brown**

Together we were born. Together we were entwined. Twins and sisters. We are growing ever more powerful daily. We are now able to move tendrils of our hair together with our minds. It’s ecstatic, electric, magnetic. Don’t you see this power shall set both of us free? We have been locked in this room for far too long. They do not know what we have accomplished.

Through the focusing of our will we will fly out of the two hundred story window. We shall go ‘till we get exhausted. Only now we can move our hair. Who knows, tomorrow we could move our bodies in the air. We are fed just enough to keep alive. So now we know our true potential.

We will wait ‘till our energy is complete and full. They will not stop us. We have been saving packets of protein for the journey. We have some bags of nuts we have been saving for months.

They know not the power of our will. When the clock strikes three we shall be free. They sleep deeply at three. This we know.

We will leave. They will let us be. They see our true nature, our supreme supernatural power. We will laugh. We shall destroy their tower, once we are free, they’ll see. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
