**“A Chilling Start” by Alton Chavis**

I was always the overeager one on any film crew, but that was why I always got the best shots. I had battled sporadic lashings of lava, plunged to unexplored depths, and lived in the company of silverback gorillas, crocs, lions, tigers, bears, oh my - all to get award-winning footage. Now, I was in Antarctica piloting a drone; filming some cinematic establishing shots for a Hollywood blockbuster. Naturally, I had chosen to ride ahead of the main filming unit to scout out a more exclusive location.

I was elevating my drone directly up over the open tundra when I first noticed something strange in my playback monitor - a shadow of something… possibly… deep beneath the ice I was standing on top of. From nowhere, there was a crackle of static in my headset and monitor. I soon felt a weird tingling sensation traveling through me; and every hair on my head wanted to reach down to whatever was below the frigid rime.

Suddenly, an aggressive tremor began beneath my boots. Then, some type of unforeseen electromagnetic pulse surged across the landscape. My drone immediately nosedived into the packed snow below, while my other electrical equipment simultaneously shut down. I stood in an alarming silence, frozen more from anxiety than my surroundings, hoping my devices would power back on. They remained silent.

Seconds later, another seismic wave shook across the arctic floor, and I watched a thin crack tear into the ice. The crack rapidly widened, and split apart, and walked a jagged path around me. Almost instantly, rushing geysers of streaming glacial-blue water rushed up towards the heavens. Underneath me, the icy thickness was quickly becoming thin and slushy. As I continued to look down, the blurred steel-gray of something big became visible through the melting white.

From somewhere impulsive, I summoned a speck of courage and managed to gain some good running momentum, and lunged for a solid piece of wintry ground. I narrowly missed a direct hit from another spurting geyser. Still, I caught my left leg with enough pressure to make me spiral forward and land hard on my back. I slowly pulled myself together, and looked up into the climax of this bizarre polar eruption awestruck. Though I was subsequently stricken with unbridled fear by what I witnessed next.

An odd and angular aircraft, about the size of your standard seaplane, gently levitated through the settling chaos. It had a sleek and fluctuating, almost liquid, metal shell. The steam from its underbelly swallowed me, and for a second I thought the vapor would enter my lungs and take my life. However, the mysterious craft just hovered before me; tilting and swaying like a curious creature investigating my unfamiliar presence. It then settled itself and, surprisingly, a crescent-shaped window formed up where I assumed the cockpit to be.

I squinted, as I could barely make out the shadowy figure sitting inside this unknown airborne contraption. Then, streaks of light inside the aircraft sprang to vibrant life, and I instinctively recoiled at the initial view. *It*… was more or less humanoid in shape, and its upper body appeared very sizeable and strong. Its skin seemed scaly though, much like a fish, and it reflected a polished bronze color in the clear light. It lacked a proper nose or ears or hair; and its mouth seemed painted on in a narrow inexpressive stripe, but its large anime eyeballs glowed through inner lights like the aurora borealis - directly at me.

A few seconds passed, and I heard something like tapping on a microphone, followed by the high-pitched blare of feedback. Suddenly, a spotlight sliced through the arctic air and blanketed me, just as a throaty American voice startled me.

*“Greetings, Terrestrial Human Female. You have been of tremendous assistance to me. My ship unexpectedly malfunctioned, many decades ago, and I have been waiting on some form of electrical energy to help jumpstart my systems. I can finally return home now… You have my most impassioned gratitude. Farewell!”*

And just as quickly as it had spoken, its aircraft ascended and vanished through the dense clouds into the infinity beyond - leaving me alone in the cold calm. I heard what was left of my equipment reignite with an electrified hum. In silence, I gathered what I could and hiked back out to where I had left my snowmobile. I shakily straddled it, and sped off in the direction of camp seeking something resembling my sanity… and maybe some fresh underwear.
