It is not a big mountain range, just a series of peaks and valleys. There are no technical climbs, but a lot of it is steep. There are trails everywhere. In one breath-taking view, you can see the majestic nature. Two minutes later, you can see a cityscape of hustle and bustle. Between these views, remnants of a war-torn country, sixty years after its end. The south side of Seoul offered me all this and more, just a few minutes walk from my apartment. Every weekend, I would find a buddy and a few PB&J sandwiches and dedicate a carefree day to the pursuit of the great unknown. Over two years, we took every fork in the road, finding the best rocks to eat the sandwiches on. Some hikes were lazy, some ambitious, but all were a joy. My friend left, and I found someone else for a month. Then he left this world behind, so suddenly, and the world of the mountain range was no longer mine. My last two weekends in the country were wasted. For though the mountains beckoned, I could not bring myself to make one last climb. My last climb was Joseph’s last venture into truly living before life’s grip was grasped away from him.
