**Two Young Women by Robert Bartlett Sr.**

They were always there before the doors opened. Sometimes, they came in and ordered drinks. They sat in a corner booth and nursed their Cokes slowly for an hour or more. In the winter, they’d occasionally get hot chocolate or coffee. In the summer, sometimes all they wanted was water. At first, I gave them a hard time about that, but I decided that it was good business to get them inside and keep them off the sidewalk out front.

All right, my conscience bothered me a little. They were sweet, really. They never made a mess in the restroom, they never blocked the doorway, and they only smoked outside. The staff liked them. They usually paid with a dollar bill. That means the tip was almost always over 11%, but when all they got was water, I lost money.

I used to wonder why they weren’t in school. I don’t know how many times I started to call a patrolman but something always stopped me. I kept thinking that sooner or later the cops or D.S.S. would get them. I remember one time they both went to the powder room, just as a patrol car pulled into the lot. O'Malley and Flannigan ate their coffee and donuts and smoked one cigarette each. I wanted the officers to question the two girls, and get them back to school or wherever they belonged. I wanted the girls to stay safely hidden until the cops left.

Conflict created tension. Tension breeds resentment. I hated the girls. I hated the cops. I loved the girls. I had profound respect for the police. I hated myself.

Exactly fifteen minutes after they got out of the car, I watched the patrolmen get back into it. They had switched sides, apparently deciding it was Flannigan’s turn to drive. When I tuned around, the girls were already back in their booth, sipping their ginger ale.

I wondered if they were hungry.
