**"My Plate" by Richard Smith**

Holidays were always a grand event at my grandparents’ house. My greatest memories revolve around dozens of kids swarming the place like fire ants on a dead beetle. One might discover a mischievous cousin hiding beneath your bed while another cousin would absently whittle away the day in Paw-Paw’s backyard hammock.

Some of my cousins relished the peaceful atmosphere of the ladies knitting room while the most rambunctious of the brood loved the blood, sweat, and tears that came from hunting in the East Texas woods. Nevertheless, the most fabulous memory remains the family’s holiday meals.

Every person in the family-owned their own special plate. At five, I was presented my own off-white-colored plate. Many, many times I got lost in the mesmerizing golden swirls around its edges. Around and around I traced the design with my finger, but I always failed to discover the pattern’s beginning or end. I’m uncertain of the family’s “plate getting age,” but it seems like almost everyone received their plate around the age of five. Weird, I know, but that’s just how it is in my family.

These special plates were closely guarded by Maw-Maw. They were only used for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The rest of the year they would be lovingly wrapped in plastic and safely tucked away in Maw-Maw’s corner cabinet. I always enjoyed watching the plates come out one at a time and Maw-Maw delicately remove the protective plastic wrapping. That plastic would be neatly folded into tiny squares and tucked out of sight beneath the double porcelain kitchen sinks.

Although I was a wild boy, I always volunteered to dry the plates after Maw-Maw and one of my aunts washed them. I loved studying all the different designs and colors covering each plate. It was like each plate took on its personality based on the personality of its owner. An angry red design went to an uptight uncle while a soft pink plate went to a gentle girl cousin. A golden swirl belonged to an inquisitive soul like me, while a plain white China plate when to my silent and studious grandfather. It was cool to see when the plate and its owner’s personality matched, but more importantly, the quicker the plates were washed and dried, the sooner we would eat!

I loved my plate almost as much as I loved my super happy Irish Setter. While the dog and I were inseparable companions, the plate and I shared many a spectacular holiday meal together. Still, a bad memory occurred every now and then. I remember one year I bumped my plate against the marble countertop and chipped the edge. When I saw the damage done, I sat down on the white tile floor and cried.

Maw-Maw came over and quickly assessed the situation. “Don’t worry,” she said, “We’ll get you another plate.”

“No,” I stubbornly said, “This one’s mine.” I hugged the chipped plate against my chest and thought of how some friends at school made fun of me because I had trouble writing words. I spelled well in my head, but on paper my letters always seemed to end up in the wrong place. Nobody knew what was wrong, so my friends just called me dumb.

“This plate’s broken just like me,” I told Maw-Maw.

“No sweetie.” She pulled me into her arms. “You’re not broken. You’re absolutely perfect just the way you are.”

The years passed and I proved that I wasn’t so perfect after all. In 1989, at the age of 16, I was on my way to prison. Still, even in my absence, every major holiday Maw-Maw unwrapped my plate, washed it clean, and sat it on the table in remembrance of me.

“I’ll always make your plate as if you’re there,” she told me at a prison visit before she got sick.

“But I’m not there,” I argued. “Just toss it in the garbage. They way it looks, I’ll never make it home anyway.”

“Yes, you will,” she soothed. “When God wills it, the doors will open.”

It’s now twenty-six years later. Maw-Maw has passed away, and the prison doors remain tightly closed. Still, come the holidays, I know I am loved because my mom carefully pulls the family’s plates from her corner cabinet and folds the plastic wrapping into neat little squares. Once washed, the plates are set on the table and piled high with delicious turkey and smoked ham.

“Mom,” I said a few years ago, “why don’t you just break my plate?”

“You’ve got to learn to understand love,” she told me. “If I break your plate then it’s like I’m giving up and saying that it’s all over. I don’t believe that for a second. Your life is far from over. On the other hand, when I make your plate, I’m declaring to God and the whole world that I know one day soon, my son is coming home. So, I will never break your plate. I will always make your plate, knowing that one day you will sit at my table and eat from it.”
