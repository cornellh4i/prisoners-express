**Forge Friendships by Leo Cardez**

“Lasting happiness is mostly about maintaining strong relationships.” -Oprah Magazine

As inmates, it is essential we actively maintain our connections with friends and family both in and out of prison. This will take a superhuman effort on our part, trust me -- I know, as any long stretch in prison typically coincides with a sudden and profound loss of relationships. In many ways, it can feel as if we’re slowly being erased, but we must do everything we can to avoid becoming too isolated. Isolation has been shown to lead to serious mental and physical deterioration and has often led to deadly consequences (hence, the recent efforts by prison reform activists to reduce or abolish the use of segregation in prisons).

Before prison, it was hard for me to comprehend how someone could feel lonely when surrounded by others. I’ve come to realize, loneliness is not an outward expression -- no amount of people around you can change the stark, desperate, solitude that engulfs our hearts and souls. And it’s killing us. In a study of the effects of loneliness on mortality, it found strong social bonds were 2 to 3 times more important as an indicator of survival than diet, exercise, or smoking. It recommends at least two daily tasks dedicated to improving a relationship. In prison, that could be writing a letter to a friend, calling a family member, playing card games with friends, sharing a meal with your celly, fellowship at chapel, walking with a friend at yard, etc. The important thing is to connect everyday with others in a social and meaningful way; with the purpose of maintaining or growing your relationships. But, making friends in prison isn’t easy -- this place is a mindfuck where everything is complicated and nuanced.

In America’s gray bar hotels, it is prudent to be weary of potential friendships: Knowing who you can trust is not as important as knowing who you can’t. In the real world, it’s simple: we select friends that bring us joy and discard anyone else. In the concrete jungle chess game of survival, it’s about so much more.

Firstly, it must be said, prisons have become America’s defacto mental health institutions. Recent government studies show that up to 55% of males in state prisons suffer from some form of mental illness, even worse, 20% are diagnosed sociopaths. Therefore, we must be vigilant of the mind games of the predators seeking prey. [Please note, I KNOW most criminals are not sociopaths and rather are normal people whose criminal behavior is part of negative social forces e.g., drug culture, child abuse, domestic violence, and cross-generational poverty.] The book, “The Sociopath Among Us” advises us to watch for key warning signs. For example, the “pity play” is the most universal behavior of unscrupulous people. They attempt to appeal to our sympathy -- they want us to feel sorry for them. They try to come off as needy or pathetic as a manipulation play. Also, watch out for those who only want to talk to you in private or whispers, they may have something to hide. In general, prison experts agree, it is smart to avoid those who fail to conform to social norms (including prison-life norms) e.g., overly aggressive, reckless, impulsive, fail to honor obligations, inconsistent work; constantly changing cells, cellies, jobs, buildings, joints; and lack remorse -- as these are all usually signs of social disorders. So now, the question begs: Well, what can we do to find friends in prison?

There’s no easy answer, but some general guidelines include:

1. Avoid negative people.

2. Realize prison has a lot of bad people -- go in with your eyes open.

3. Go with your gut -- follow your instincts and first impressions.

4. Be suspect of flattery -- it is a counterfeit charm.

5. Search out those with common interests.

6. Don’t pity or become a pity friend.

7. Do not try to redeem the unredeemable.

8. Never hang out with anyone that asks you to lie or hide for them.

9. Be around those you respect and admire -- we are who we surround ourselves with.

10. Rule of 3: if someone lets you down (lies to you, breaks a promise to you, neglects a responsibility owed to you) 3 times -- cut them out of your life. They are not your friend. Believe someone when they show you who they are.

The reality is, if you live well and healthy, like-minded others will find you. But even that is not foolproof. The truth is, it could take years to really know someone i.e., know if you can trust them. But, in an effort to expedite the process, I have created my own set of “tests” of character to identify those that may be friend worthy.

[Disclaimer: These are not scientifically proven methods. They are simply something that has worked for me in the past. Use at your own peril.]

One easy example, I offer someone I think may be a good person, whom I have been talking to, a “blessing” -- it could be anything from a honey bun to something special from chow. The key is that it has intrinsic value i.e., it’s something others would want. I note their demeanor -- are they thankful or suspicious? Do they accept it or not? If so, do they offer anything in return either at the time or in the future? My offer does not come with any strings, I have learned giving without expecting anything in return is the best way to live in prison, but how someone reacts to an unexpected blessing from another can tell you a lot about someone’s character. Do they at least seem grateful and have the courtesy to thank you? You’d be surprised how many times my generosity has not deemed worthy of a simple word of thanks. You can be sure none of those have become my friends. Another option is to ask your potential friend to borrow something that puts them out a bit (it doesn’t have to be anything you actually even need). A. Are they willing to do you this favor? B. Do they try to gouge you or hold it over you in return? It is these types of situations that are going to tell you about someone’s true nature. Learn to listen and watch for the clues and consider yourself lucky when you discover someone’s true character. Now you know to avoid them and maybe it only cost you a honey bun… you got off cheap. On the flip side, maybe you’ll discover someone with a kind, generous heart and good moral character and again, it might have only cost you a honey bun. What a great return on investment!

Okay, so now you have a couple of friends in prison -- good for you -- it is time to maintain and grow these relationships. How do we do that? Well, firstly, by being a good friend ourselves. And how do we do that? Well, in here, good friendships are rooted in trust and respect -- both of which can only be earned. Try these tips from [www.experiencelife.com](http://www.experiencelife.com/) on how to be trustworthy and respectful:

1. Be transparent and accountable -- make your intentions known and be very clear about what you want from someone else and what they can expect from you.

2. Keep confidences -- gossiping diminishes your character to both the person you gossip about and to those you gossip with.

3. Set and respect boundaries -- when people see you set boundaries for yourself, they respect you.

4. Be vulnerable. This is a tough one in prison as the predators often confuse kindness and openness with weakness, but if you trust someone, it can help grow and fortify your friendship.

5. Have discussions -- in person. Address issues calmly, but directly, face-to-face.

6. Serve others. “Being kind and generous leads you to perceive others more positively and more charitably,” writes University of California psychology professor Sonja Lyubormisky PhD, in “The How of Happiness.”

7. Show your gratitude. Research has shown that expressing your thanks can strengthen relationships.

Do I practice everything I write here? Do I believe that if I did I would be a better friend and attract better friendships? Whole-heartedly. The truth is, I’m not a “friendly” kind of guy,, not really, I’m friendly, in general, but I am not someone who either likes nor wants a lot of friends. Even before prison, I only had a handful of real friends, but the quality more than made up for the quantity. I am the same in prison. I try to surround myself with a small group of like-minded positive people who I feel I can trust. I’m not perfect. I’ve made my fair share of bad character judgements and have gotten burned accordingly. But, for the most part, I have been fortunate, a combination of luck and strategy. Recently, I was moved to a new building and have since begun to cultivate a few new friendships here. Two of them are guys I have known for years, I have played basketball and soccer with them, seen them at chapel services, and greeted them in passing, but I never thought of them as real friends. Now that we live in the same building and I am able to observe them at close proximity and interact with them on a consistent basis< i noticed they shared many of the qualities I admire in a friend. They are kind, generous, patient, intelligent, humble, and live a positive life with strong moral character. They have passed my tests and I try my best to be a good friend in return. I am confident we are well on our way to building a strong foundation to our friendship. Will we be lifelong friends? Probably not. Inmate life doesn’t work that way (Andy and Red were just a movie). But, that’s okay. Today, here and now, Senegal and Cheddar are my friends… and that is enough. By being friends we are helping each other get through this harder-than-we-could-have-ever-imagined thing called life and, if you really think about it, that’s all we can ever hope to have in our friendships.

Dedicated to all my friends. Thank you for your friendship.

SECOND SUBMISSION:

Convict Chronicles by Leo Cardez

I miss having real friends. Friendships in prison are complicated not only by the physical limitations -- any of us could be moved to another cell, building, or facility at a moment’s notice which can mean never seeing or hearing from someone again. But also, by the lack of trust this place imbues in the soul. God forbid you decide to look up someone’s crime -- sometimes the horrible details are difficult to align with the person you know.

Shankster (real prison nickname, but not the real nickname of the person to whom I am referring) and I were cellies for years and had developed a good, healthy friendship. He was funny and generous and eventually I came to trust him explicitly. But when I had my sister deposit some money into his account as repayment for a painting, she chose to look up his conviction details. It was a heinous story which ended with two grisly deaths including a beheaded child. I could never look at him the same. And yet, I’m sure he would feel the same if he chose to look up my crimes.

Prison has helped me learn the difference between lifelong friendships and “situationships.” There is something about being put into an extreme or new circumstance e.g., prison, military service, college where we are hurled together with others that can feel like they’ve become our chosen family and sometimes they do, but more likely they are just our friends during this important phase of our life. It’s unfortunate but sometimes as we grow, we outgrow or grow apart from even our bestest friends. It has torn my heart out as I’ve mourned the death of so many friendships, both from the world and this human warehouse, than I care to remember. My only solace: I always keep the memories.
