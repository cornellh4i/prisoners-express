**“In the Old Days” by Joshua Balistreri**

It’s strange, really. How things just hit you. One day you’re twenty years old, and every day holds promise, and the next thing you know, it’s twenty years later, and it happens out of the blue. Without even realizing it, you’ll catch yourself saying something like: “in the old days” or “back in the day.” The worst part is, we don’t notice it’s happening most of the time.

It happened to me once. I heard a song from when I was in high school on a classic rock station. It caught me so off guard I had to check the dial to make sure it was tuned into the station I thought it was. And I suppose it just happened again as I write this, it dawned on me that event had occurred nearly a decade ago!

But that’s how it works. Time flows in one direction. No matter how many science fiction writers construct scenarios in which they have devised ways to change that it won’t change. And even more unfortunate is the fact that the more of that flow we have personally experienced the quicker the flow becomes.

Eventually we all find ourselves in the same place. In one way or another dating ourselves, and suddenly coming to awareness of how much time has passed. We all catch ourselves saying things; while telling stories to those around us who’ll still listen like “in the old days…”

They sat there quietly after I’d instructed them to sit. All of them seemed a bit more at ease now. Not much, but certainly more so than when I had first entered the room and each and every one of them stood at attention ramrod straight and snapped crisp salutes. I am their superior officer and that show of respect was in order, However now that I have their respect, I need to earn their trust.

This was my squadron. A unit of pilots that were, yes, colored, but also would be the very best. We were not the first with the famous Red Tails, but I was determined we would not be the last. It was my job to ensure their success.

I was not concerned, in the least with the color of their skin; unlike much of the world at that time. All I cared about was their ability. Nor did I care where they’d come from. Only what they could do. I had hand picked each one of these men for their accomplishments. Each and every one had the reflexes of a cat, and each had in one way or another, displayed leadership qualities.These were the things I looked for in them. The only things I saw when looking out at them now.

And so, there they sit. Quietly watching me. Patiently waiting to hear what it is I have to say to them. As I look into each of their young faces I swell with pride. This is my squadron. So, to them I say: “Gentlemen, let’s begin.”
