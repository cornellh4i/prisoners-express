**"The Future Matriarch Butterfly" by Brendon Fleming**

I stare at the age old photo, my first known picture. Now I am the only one still living out of the four individuals easily recognizable as persons. This is not including the numerous hidden military snipers, the presence of whom we were always suspicious.

Now some forty-five years later, I imagine just exactly what it was that I was thinking at that time. I seemingly rest contently in Grandmother’s embrace, even while we hid, halfway submerged, forced to wade in some flume-like canal surrounded by rugged and weedy terrain. What is going on under my woven village hat that I’m told was gift to celebrate my second birthday, from my mother, Man-Tiev, the beautiful young women, second in the photo. The leading woman is my aunt Ming Lea, my mother’s elder sister.

I am angry about the political circumstances of the war, that, in a cruel fashion, literally tore into two the only homeland my mother knew. Hanoi was divided between the years of 1954 and 1974 into the separate states of North Vietnam-Hanoi and South Vietnam-Saigon.

All those political ideas are far and removed from me now, here in Boise, Idaho. Halfway around the world and over four decades of time. Though I still long to know these beautiful ladies. I smile as I look down at the same beautiful brown eyes. Meet Little Ming Lea, a real born leader, truly a beautiful butterfly. My daughter of two years now.
