**My Body by Lance Porter**

My eye is always critical

Finding flaw in this suit of flesh

and bone, always seeing perfection

in others, never content with myself

The “If onlys” plague my thoughts

If only I were taller

If only I had a fuller head of hair

If only I were greater endowed

If only my complexation was clearer

If only etc.

This cycle goes round and round

Again, and as it does my skin grows

looser, my hair thinner, my posture

slouches, my steps as unsure a baby

trying to find their balance for the

first time.

If only I had not spent so much

time worrying about my body.
