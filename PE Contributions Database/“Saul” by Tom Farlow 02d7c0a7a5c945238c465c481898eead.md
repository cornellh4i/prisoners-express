**“Saul” by Tom Farlow**

Mawkish sentimentality was all that Saul knew and felt at this moment. A considerable amount of exhaustion threatening to seal his eyes shut was only kept at bay in the era of Wonder by the Muse of His Past sitting before him; her emanating energy enough for both to traverse this surreal moment of time. This promise of Tomorrow was a thing of beauty, like Lilly was. The joint—normally oppressed with a thick humidity of watered-down gin, floating cotton balls of cigar and cigarette smoke, and the forlorn caterwauling of a worn-out musician accosting the ears of a drunken audience—transformed, instead, into a scene of liveliness and happening simple from her graceful entrance and smile.

That smile. Her smile. Every time her lips pulled to disperse mirth, it was the breaking and remaking of his heart. The complete happiness displayed on her face, in her eyes, as it held that expressing, to him, was the absolute model of beauty and poise. This room of the sad who had trudged the distance here to hulk over their beers and avoid the harsh, bitter reality living outside could not help but to dive into the light that enveloped them as she strode through those doors attached to his unworthy arm. Her pearly whites sending rays of joy upon this wasteland of unsuspecting victims, their lives forever better for it. He escorted Lilly and her luminescent ambiance to a table near the back, and sat by her side.

He hadn’t seen her in years. Those years—lost to the mistakes of the past and the demons of drugs, sex, and alcohol—could never hope to be replaced. When they were younger, he had captured her love, attention and adoration. Those waves of sentiment crested through to crash on the Rocky Crags of Regret along with the Shores of Sorrow. Now though, as they sat here together, her head swiveling left and right surveying the scene, he couldn’t keep from wondering how he was now worthy of even her presence, let alone her radiant smile.

Was this a first step to sealing the chasm split between them? In a million years, never would he have lain money on this scenario playing out. Ever. How wrong he had been.

Now, worry fought to sink its ugly fingertips into the joy of his heart. Could he be wrong as to her motive being here? Was there something behind that smile he could not glean?

Oh great. Now worry opened the road for fear and paranoia to rush in. Apprehension about himself that he was unable to embrace the simplicity of reconciling as a step towards a better tomorrow. Where does this go from here? What’s the right path for this to go onward? God help him, he loved this woman, and did not want to lose her again to stupidity, arrogance and selfishness.

When the phone rang three weeks ago, he reluctantly picked up the receiver expecting another demand from collections—times were hard now. But, there was her voice on the other end. Reaching out to tug at his heartstrings, and for the life of him, he could not recall one word either of them shared. He only knew she would be here today because he wrote it down in rapturous haste. On the ride here, she briefed him on seeing her mother, and she too felt it was right to reach out to him.

How could she find it in her heart to forgive? After all he had done? Where’s the bitterness expected after all these years? Hadn’t he warranted a permanent exile from all she would accomplish in life? How does he thank her for this second chance?

She asked him if this was his usual place lately. It was. Here they were. The forgotten years full of unknowns now tentatively being coaxed into the open, she seemed as hesitant as he in how far or fast the reach went. Hadn’t she given more though? She went the distance just by calling, right?

The marquee on the façade promoted “The Piano Man” was to be on stage tonight. He remembered from long ago her love for the ivory keys, her heart alit when the felt-tipped hammers hit the taut strings, bringing harmony from a cacophony. Could she suspect why they were here tonight? He used to be able to read her so well. Not anymore. But, it’s time now.

Time for “The Piano Man” to take the stage. Hope coursed through his veins that she might know she is who the songs will be for tonight. In his heart, the notes were only for his Lilly.

He arose leaving her sitting there, alone. For the first time in this new start, he was again causing confusion and distress to mar and with her beautiful smile. His glance back was meant to give her reassurance he wasn’t going far.

The piano was there. Waiting.

For him.

Those years after losing her from his own failing nearly drove him to suicide. Only by embracing her other love she held carried him through dark valleys of depression and gut wrenching agony from bouts of self-recrimination and hate. All negativity purged as he learned to caress the ivory black and whites into singing his solitude away, instead of drinking to forget. Piano was his medicine and penance for his sins.

The bench felt like home now, and she was finally going to hear him play for her. His daughter would listen to all his apologies. Not from his knees, but from the notes he played tonight. They would have extra weight from the thanks of being given this chance by her. Tonight, these men who had come to weep into their beer would, instead, hear healing and have knowledge that strength to reconnect to that which is lost still exists.

He looked over to her, winked, and looked at the keys lost to the moment now. They were dancing at her wedding. They sat by the bayou fishing off a doc, the waters lapping against the pillars. Grandchildren running around as family reunions commenced. Her hand holding his as he exhaled his last.

Possibilities to come.

A new world before them. Endless and all within his grasp now. The wisps of his thoughts echoing from the stage as the lights fell to start the show.
