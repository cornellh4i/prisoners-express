**Prisoners’ Lives Matter by G.A.F. Littlefield**

You become a prisoner, you gotta fight for Your Life... You gotta fight for your rights... Once you've been convicted, nothing comes for free... Accept advice, and here's mine:

Thanks to Ivan you can file Appeals regarding covid-19 and overcrowding cite 2020 DJDAR11353 in re Ivan Von Staich: Population was ordered at San Quentin, in October,  2 substantial risk of substantial harm. And CDC’s deliberate indifference to prisoners not being able to social distance due to cell overcrowding. The court also found it was not a Plata Issue... Cali prisoners and all of the rest of you, Get Up, Stand Up. Wait there's more... This next bit is for any of you banging away at illegal state convictions. (I know you're out there. I read your writings.) Almost all constitutional litigation challenging the constitutionality of state and local actions is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983. Section 1983  requires that the action be “under the color of law". The USSC has said that this is the same inquiry as to whether there is State action. Lugar v Edmondon Oil co., 457 U.S. 922, 928-932 (1982); U.S. V. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794 n7 (1966). [If a person is employed by the  government and acting as a government officer, there is no doubt that there is State action and the Constitution applies.]

You're welcome.  Don't back down... There's no easy way out... Stand your ground... Don't give up the fight... Prisoners' lives matter. That's you and me, on your feet or on your knees, you gotta fight for your right to be free dot-dot. Or at least safe... You are all writers... Write some paper... Prisoners' lives matter... And we're all in this together.
