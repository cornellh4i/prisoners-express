**“Girl Playing Flute” by Cesar Hernandez**

Ever since you were a child, you’ve had energies going on inside. Wake up and realize that you are in there, and you have a sensitive part of yourself feeling disturbance. See it feel jealousy, need, and fear. These feelings are just part of the nature of a human being. If you pay attention, you will see that they are not you; they are just something you’re feeling and experiencing. You are the in dwelling being that is aware of all of this. If you maintain your center, you can learn to appreciate and respect even the difficult experiences.

Some of the most beautiful poetry and music have come from people who were in turmoil. Great art comes from the depth of one’s being. You can experience these very human states without getting lost in them or resisting them. You can notice that you notice and just watch how experiencing loneliness affects you. Does your posture change? Do you breathe slower or faster? What goes on when loneliness is given the space it needs to pass through you? Be an explorer, witness it, and then it will go. If you don’t get absorbed in it, the experience will soon pass and something else will come up. Just enjoy all of it. If you can do this, you will be free, and a world of pure energy will open up within you.
