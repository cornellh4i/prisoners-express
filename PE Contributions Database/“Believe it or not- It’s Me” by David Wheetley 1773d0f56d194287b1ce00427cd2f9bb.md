**“Believe it or not- It’s Me” by David Wheetley**

I had a conversation with someone I cared about but I wasn’t sure I loved anymore. I heard his words clear as day, however the voice seemed foreign,a language I could understand but different somehow. Maybe it was what was being said that threw me off. The face was familiar yet looked distorted and strange: a face I recognized, but from a long time ago.

He kept telling me that I should not give up on myself because, although I am serving a death sentence in slow motion, and that I really don’t have to comply, conform or in any way amend my attitude and behavior, that my “life” still has value. “What value!” I scream back. He is surprisingly calm and tells me, “You’re not defined by the things you have done, you are defined by the positive impact you have on the people you encounter on a daily basis.” “Bullshit,” I said. This sentence has eradicated any semblance of the person I had the potential to be. He replied, “That is not true, why not go back to studying the bible? You used to be big on religion.” My only reply was “Jesus never had a goddamn chance. What chance do you think I have?” He started to shake his head, he sighed and then said “Well what about hope, you haven’t lost hope for freedom have you?” I laughed. “Hope is too me but a four letter word that people with weak minds have, because they do not see the reality of their situation.”

He just shook his head. I could see that I was wearing him down, and he was starting to get fed up with my counter arguments. I felt a sense of pride that for all of his positivity I was breaking down his defenses and making him see the flaws in his arguments. This is not the place for pride, compassion or hope.

To be honest, my only hope is that this person quits talking to me about his bullshit optimism. But, of course, he never shuts up and he kept talking. He asked me, “Is your love for yourself bigger than your mistake? That is a stupid question” I replied. “How so,” he said. “I will always love myself more than my biggest mistake, because if I don’t love me then no one else will.” “Exactly!” he said. “Now you are starting to see you have to love yourself, and care about yourself, and have hope that when you come to that proverbial fork in the road, you will stop choosing the path of least resistance and get on the path of self discovery, love and compassion. That is your true freedom.”

“Listen, bro, please shut up. I can’t deal with that kind of talk right now. Let's talk again later, maybe next year, maybe then I will be more receptive to your ‘message.’” He just shook his head and said, “That is what you said last year and the year before that.”

I went to the sink, hoping to drown out the sound of his voice, washed my face, looked in the mirror and finally, I recognized the face, the person that was speaking the whole time- believe it or not- was me.
