**“The Trio” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

Grandfather, Grandson, and man’s best friend.

When time is meaningless and no one wants the day to end

Grandfather just wishes to pass some wisdom on.

Grandson will cherish these moments when Grandfather is gone.

Man’s best friend is just happy to be there

Everyone enjoying the weather so fair

Mild talk to welcoming ears

Everything moving as smoothly as well oiled gears

The bond between the three is so strong

Side-by-side is where they belong

Behind the trio Grandmother snaps a picture, now frozen in time

As so many priceless moments are, it didn’t cost a dime.
