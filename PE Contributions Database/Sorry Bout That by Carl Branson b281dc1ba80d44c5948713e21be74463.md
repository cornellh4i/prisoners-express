**“Sorry ‘Bout That” by Carl Branson**

How often have each of us used or heard these three little words of some variation thereof? This sort of apology invariably accompanies inadvertent conduct like bumping into someone on a sidewalk or other minor offense. But what about more significant sources of harm caused to another? Automobile collisions are probably the most common form of inattentive or negligent behavior requiring an apology together with remedial actions (paying for repairs, medical bills, etc.).

Certainly the just cited examples represent the extreme limits of circumstances where an apology is appropriate. However, just as it takes “two to tango,” it takes two to make an apology truly effective and meaningful. The person making the apology must experience the appropriate level of a sense of remorse, guilt, or embarrassment to warrant an apology. The person receiving the words of apology must be willing to grant forgiveness appropriate to the offense suffered.

These two factors which make an apology both effective and meaningful is rarely achieved for convicted felons. Even when the convict sincerely has the necessary sense of guilt and remorse, it is rare that the victim is willing to grant forgiveness.
