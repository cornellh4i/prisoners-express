**A Purposeful or A Purposeless Life? By Nate A. Lindell**

“I am grateful to destiny from having made my life into an exciting experience so that life has appeared meaningful...”

-Albert Einstein, emphasis mine.

A recently solidified realization of mine is that most people do not know who they are. Instead, most people have a deluded view of themselves, more than the blurry image that will always be when a subject tries to objectively view themselves (a distortion akin to that of our sense of how we sound compared to a recording of our voice). How can a person deluded about themselves pursue a truly purposeful life?

Most people live lives with no purpose, often “of quiet desperation,” reacting to life’s circumstances or acting as puppets to some ideological master: a religion, a political theory, a government, a gang.... They pressure the few self-actuated homo sapiens sapiens (i.e. very wise apes, humans, as opposed to mere homo sapiens, wise apes) into joining a herd too, and thereby find comfort in a purposeless life. Being a follower is pathetic, but being a follower in a system that feeds off of others’ misery (e.g. members of drug-dealing orgs) is despicable, to me.

An example of the despicable, the type of sheeple that draws the greatest contempt from the abyss that is my soul recently displayed himself to me. A pig (a particularly appropriate pseudonym, given his razor-backesque buzz cut, his overbloated pot beslly, and the sweat streak saturating his hog back-turning keys and squatting to put on shackles is hard work), while engages in the cumbersome procedure of placeing an over restrained prisoner in an outdoor rec. Cage next to mine, leered at his partner, chuckled, said “‘cause it was overtime I was making $50 an hour, for sitting in a van,'' talking about transporting a prisoner to the hospital (severely injured by another inmate).

Such piggish conversations are common amongst our captors, as if the commodities they’re escorting are too stupid to realize those pigs see us as mere commodities, not conscious of their sideways insult and degeneracy. Such pigs may only be homo (pun not intended to insult LGBTQs).

As I said, most people are unconscious as to their true character. It’s a self defense mechanism: if that pig, e.g., says himself as he truly is, he’d cut his miserable throat and hope for reincarnation as a higher life form, maybe a turd beetle.

Imagine the horror that pig must feel when his delusion occasionally falters and he sees what an irrelevant parasitical cog in a shitty machine he is!

They will never contribute anything beautiful or brilliant to human existence. They are content with preserving and passins on to their piglets their profitable purposelessness, like a cancerous social tumor.

That’s them. Let it not be us!

The purposelessness lives of prisoncrats (and inmates who, indirectly, play along with the P.I.C.) gives purpose to my own. While I’d rather be engaged in creating literary or visual art, my character impels me to expose and contest prisoncrats’ efforts to inflict purposelessness on their captives, to hold out and snip the strings leading from their limbs to their plutocrat puppet masters’ fat fingers. This is a purpose that every very wise ape in prison is honor bound to adopt as part of their raison d’etre.

Whether or not success is achieved, the goal is noble, pursuit, with vigor, is enough; as E.A. Poe said in “El Dorado,” “Ride, boldly ride.”

The shade replied,

“If you seek El Dorado.”
