**“Been There, Done That” by Carl Branson**

****The punch line to an old joke about a multi-million dollar study to identify the cause of divorce was: marriage is the primary cause of divorce. Since a wedding is the ceremony which validates marriage in society’s eyes, they are likewise a cause of divorce. For me, the question to be addressed is: what motivates couples to get married?

Since it has been almost 50 years after my first marriage, I take a retrospective approach to answering that query. There were two primary factors leading to that first wedding. One aspect was confusing sated lust with love. The other was a mutual desire to be free of parental control. In many ways, a sense of rebellion was at the core of both of these components.

Both my first wife and I were brought up in staunch Roman Catholic homes. But, the 60s hippie mantra of “free love, anything goes” had us rutting in the back seat of her ‘57 chevy while subconscious guilt fertilized that dogmatic seed of “sex is reserved for marriage” which was planted early in our youth. The subconscious guilt together with the promise of independence won out and we were married at age 20. It was the traditional church wedding: her in the long white gown and me in a rented tux. A blonde, blue-eyed daughter blessed us one year later with divorce shortly after her first birthday.

The second go-round was different yet the same. Although I was able to distinguish between sated lust and love, contraceptives are prone to failure, and that dogmatic bug-a-boo of “sex is reserved for marriage” had yet to die. My then just dumped girlfriend showed up at my door with a positive pregnancy test. Of course, I had to “do the right thing.” The wedding was a few weeks later in the chambers of a local county judge. Two months later during a prenatal doctor’s appointment, the prior positive test result was disavowed with the doctor surmising that it was a psychological pregnancy due to her overwhelming desire to get married. We “stuck it out” for two years.

Then in my upper-mid-twenties I had no desire for any kind of long term relationship and pursued the stereotypical “Randy bachelor” lifestyle. That lasted until age 31 when my employer transferred me to their new facility in the desert southwest.

A chance grocery store meeting brought Pam into my life. This was a very strange situation. Although Pam was definitely attractive enough, there was no immediate romantic or “hot-to-trot” spark between us. However, we immediately discovered a long ignored shared interest in square dancing. Together with other friends we started attending “refresher lessons” with a local square dance club. Still no archetypical romantic stirrings, though “family” outings with Pam’s two teenage songs to their sporting events, picnics, dinners, etc., were becoming commonplace. We were the very best of friends. The spark that ignited our “romantic” flame was a male friend of mine asking if I would mind his asking Pam out for a date. His perception was that Pam and I were a “couple.” I was stunned speechless! That night Pam and I had a very serious, long conversation about our relationship. What we discovered is that both of us were repressing our libido due to past experience with the lust/love conflict, as well as with that of divorce. Pam’s additional concern was that her boys made her a “packaged deal.” The hurdle of teen sons had been cleared early on due to our “family” outings. The boys and I had an excellent understanding of each other as well as our respective roles in a family unit. The wedding, like everything else in our relationship, was a simple ceremony in our living room with a minister friend officiating and, beside Pam’s sons, only six of our closest friends in attendance. A beautiful daughter joined us fourteen months later and a handsome son eighteen months thereafter. This joyous fairytale does not, however, have a happy ending because Pam died of breast cancer four days after our seventh wedding anniversary.

Weddings? Yeah- been there, done that. For me that cliche “the third time's the charm” is too true to contemplate. Will there be a fourth? Not likely; Pam was that proverbial “one-in-a-million.” Plus, at my age, why bother.
