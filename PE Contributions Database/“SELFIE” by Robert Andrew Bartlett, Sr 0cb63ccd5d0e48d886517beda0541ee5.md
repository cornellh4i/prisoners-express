**“SELFIE” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

You can’t really see me, but I’m in that gondola under the blimp (or dirigible or airship or LTAC or whatever you want to call it). You see us over football and soccer fields filming bird’s-eye views of all the action, but did you ever wonder who photographs us? I took this one myself, in my birthday suit, and posted it on my Facebook wall.

It’s easy. I’ve got dozens of them, actually. I don’t have to fiddle with a smartphone. I’m surrounded by at least eight drones at all times. I sit in front of a bank of monitors, and when I see something I like, I just push a button.

Many of the closer shots contain classified information. I can’t show you them. A couple show me with recognizable facial or other features. If you saw one of them, I’d have to kill you. ;)

Of course, we have lots of footage of the games up here but that’s a PR thing. We’re really up here to watch the border.

See the hills at the bottom of the picture? The people on the other side of those mountains are dangerous. The CIA reports have identified thousands of Communists, religious extremists, rebels, insurrectionists, drug pushers, terrorists and environmentalists.

Mostly, we just watch and report. We monitor movements of troops, tanks, artillery and school buses. I’ve got a file drawer full of pictures of village officials and local police having sex. Oh yeah our drones see it all--every pubic hair (some of our assets don’t have any) and every drop of cum! We have something on every government official in the area--ours and theirs. - every big land owner, too. - even the pastor, priests and ___

Blackmail usually works, but some of the most stubborn radicals have to be neutralized by less delicate means. Drones are good for that, too. My personal favorite, #27, has terminated four of them. That’s not counting the women who died in the hospital maternity ward we blew up last week. I always feel bad after my drones shoot up a school or a hospital, but it’s all for a good cause. Someday, the bad guys will stop resisting and embrace democracy.
