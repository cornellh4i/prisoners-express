I conducted interviews over the phone then was asked to come in to review some videos pertaining to different job locations. This took place at the main locations, and after about a week, everyone was sent to the locations around the city where they would be working and continuing training and orientation. On my first day, it felt good to be doing something different and productive.

I never got to have, or work, my first job. Leaving training and orientation that night, I caught my case and was arrested the next day which would have been the first day. The date was November 29th, 2000, and Iâ€™m still waiting to experience my first job.
