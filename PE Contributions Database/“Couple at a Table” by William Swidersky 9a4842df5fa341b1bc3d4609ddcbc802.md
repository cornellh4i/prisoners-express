**“Couple at a Table” by William Swidersky**

Looking at this happy couple reminds me of my old neighborhood in Chicago. It was way back in 1969 when I was 10 years old. I was roller skating down the street when Jean and John Gabor came out of their porch to watch me skate. I was amazed at how interested they seemed to be in what a youngster like myself was doing.

I remember they were sitting there holding hands and at the time I didn’t think much of it. But I realize now how much they must have loved each other to still be holding hands well into their 60s. But to this day, I remember how they watched with a smile on their faces.

Another time they were watching and I stopped and talked with them and they told me that they were a skating pair and had actually won medals in the Nationals and the Olympics. Now I knew why they were so interested and it made me feel pretty good.

So many years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So Jean and John, thanks for a happy memory that has lasted me a lifetime.
