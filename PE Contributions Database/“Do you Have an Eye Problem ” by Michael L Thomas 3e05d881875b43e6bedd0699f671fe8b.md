**“Do you Have an Eye Problem?” by Michael L. Thomas**

Walking along the avenue in my small hick town of Bloomfield, West Virginia during a break for lunch at my summer job as an administrative assistant, I see many college-aged students during break. Many of them are doing the same as I while on a break from college, working and saving money for college expenses for the upcoming semesters.

I realized early on that I was, and still am, a very attractive woman, so as I walk from the office towards my favorite lunchtime haunt, The Big Buffet, I noticed this handsome couple, and even handsomer man with his assumed girlfriend. In my position at work, I often get to wear short-sleeved, short hemmed stylish business attire. This day I had on a lavender colored mini-dress and sleeveless that revealed my long tanned legs and shapely form. As I passed the couple, I caught the male somewhat gawking as I crossed paths, and so I winked my eyes at him and said, “Do you have an eye problem?” The guy literally totally forgot that he was with his girl - I assume - and proceeded to whistle at me, *phew - pheew!* I could only imagine the look on his girlfriend’s face or how she felt at that moment, but being the type of woman I was at the time, a bit loose and sex fueled, I smiled at the unsuspected attention and the reaction I got from this guy. I am a sexual creature, but I can clearly say that I was in need of adjusting my behavior especially and how I related to men and that dark side of me that leads me to be flirtatious and aloof by acting out in a way that’s not becoming of a lady.

But what the hell, I am a college co-ed, and I believe that in my natural state, I am a sexual creature - that our sexuality is a gift that is a part of what makes us whole. I feel good when my body moves - dancing, exercising, yoga, all physical movements feel good to me. I believe that a part of honoring myself is acknowledging my sexual nature as a part of my whole self, and that is has potential to bring joy to my life. My journey is to reconnect my spirituality with my sexuality.

I learned early that behaving seductively was a good way to get the attention I craved and that it made me feel powerful. By the age of 18, I was confident of my ability to manipulate the opposite sex, and it felt like a game to me. I think of myself as being very independent and not needing any particular man in the way I clearly need my family and friends.

And so I ask myself, *do you have an eye problem?* Yes, I do! I need to look at the shame and remorse that others are filled with when I act inappropriately and act out with uninhibited prowess. But never mind me - ‘cause I am a college student, and I’m signing off as I consciously chose to live the wild life and have relationships that made me most excited by being used emotionally and sexually. I am liberated and free, willing to sacrifice my reputation and obvious “eye problem” to guard my independence and protect my shortcomings from others who are unlike me and not able to experience the ultimate rush of being an eye candy.
