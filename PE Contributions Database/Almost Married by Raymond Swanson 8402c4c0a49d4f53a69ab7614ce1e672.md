**“Almost Married” by Raymond Swanson**

On a clear blue mid-summer evening I stood with my fiancée across from a little white chapel on the main street in Niagara Falls, New York.

We woke up early on a Saturday that we both had off from work and decided to take a day trip like we had done so many times before during our time together. It took us two and a half to three hours to get to the tourist attraction and, once we found a place to park, we quickly made our way to a path that led to the falls. Along the way we stopped to take in the Canadian skyline and to have another tourist take our picture with it behind us. We walked around and checked out the many observation sites. I wanted to be there at night because I remembered from my childhood and from pictures I’d seen online that the falls were lit in many colors and I knew my fiancée would like that.

We came out of a small gift shop and the small chapel was across the street. I suggested, rather jokingly, that we could get married. I had proposed nearly two years earlier. The fact that I loved her so much and the idea that I loved love, and wanted to spend fifty, sixty or seventy years with her propelled me into proposing young. I felt we could take on the world and always regretted not getting married within the first few months of being engaged.

We discussed a few moments the possibility that we could really go through with this. We both hemmed and hawed, not sure if this was the right time. None of our parents were around and we didn’t exactly have a witness, though I’m certain one could have been provided or pulled in from the street. In the end we settled on just going back down by the now lit-up falls and going on with life unmarried. Yes, I almost got married on a bright clear blue summer afternoon in 2009.
