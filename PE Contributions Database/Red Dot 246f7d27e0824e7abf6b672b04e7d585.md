**by Red Dot**

Up in a house, not my house,

tied and bound,

Red Dot keeps a shaver

Red Dot shaves his head

before he peels the skin of the head.

Red Dot doing his artwork on this head.

Red Dot saying, all you had to do was give it up.

Now let me grab a mirror, look at you look.

Ha, you didnâ€™t have to pay for this haircut.

You will remember this haircut the rest of your life.

Wish i had a straight edge, not this tactical knife

Where is it now? Red Dot just working

Red Dot, do you think like this. Yes I do, Red Dot said

Thing, rewind.
