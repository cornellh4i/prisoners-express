**“The Plot on the Pier” by Bobby Bunderson**

As I stepped out of the camper and onto the serene desert floor, I experienced an overwhelming sensation of peaceful tranquility. Although it was just past midnight in Arizona, the stark beauty of the barren landscape was evident. Looking down from the sloping hillside of our campsite lay the mighty Colorado river, a long expanse of black nothingness; invisible to the night if not for the large swath of river illuminated by the silvery moonlight.

The only sounds were the soft rustlings of the leaves of the blossoming oleanders as they danced softly to the warm breath of desert breeze, their blooms permeating the campground with their perfume. Standing as still as you could while quieting your breath, you could also hear the rippling sounds of the river as the boats bobbed sleepily in their moorings. I was keenly aware of self, in harmony with the rich blessings of nature. I was at this moment, happy to be alive.

Quick, heavy, footfalls abruptly shattered my serenity. Before I could react, the large fist of an airline mechanic landed brutally on my left temple. I dropped to my knees, my vision faded away. I cautiously opened my eyes just as the pointed end of a cowboy boot smashed into my ribcage, breaking two ribs. The pain was excruciating and I fought mightily to stay conscious. “Get up! Get up you little smart mouth son-of-a-bitch!” my father screamed down at my crumpled form, flecks of saliva and cheap vodka spewing from his rage contorted mouth. I made an attempt at standing but half-way upright I was greeted by another crushing blow to the cheekbone. The force of the punch spun me around 180 degrees, I was in mortal fear for my life and my instinctual fight or flight response kicked into gear. I made a hasty retreat down the hill towards the marina. I ran to the boat docks and onto the long floating pier. Once I reached the end I seriously contemplated diving into the river and swimming across to the far shore and to safety, but my broken ribs kept me from doing so. Instead, I sat down, removed my shoes and soaked my bare feet in the cool healing waters of the Colorado.

I sat there with my feet in the water and contemplated my next move. I did come to one non-negotiable conclusion: this was the last straw. The beginning of the end. Right then and there I made a solemn oath to myself that I would never play the role of the victim again. This marked the period in my life when I stopped depending on anyone, when I stopped trusting anyone. It was me against the world. My father’s abuse – physical, mental and emotional – was irreparable. My mind, body and soul had been decimated; systematically and sadistically laid to ruin. My childhood was officially over. No more innocence, no more carefree laughter, no more blind faith in anyone. I had in that instant begun assembling a wall around my heart. Had I known at that moment of despair, the hopelessness and the soul-stripping loneliness which would plague me for decades to follow, would I still make this conscious decision? I doubt it. But I didn’t know. So for years I carried them scars with me into every relationship I encountered. I became selfish, prideful, codependent and violent. Low self-esteem and low self-worth were temporarily extinguished by the never-ending assortment of drugs and alcohol I craved and consumed. My resentments burned in my heart like the flames of a dragon’s breath. I learned to hate myself with a fervor which culminated in two failed suicide attempts. I couldn’t or wouldn’t allow myself to see that there were people around me who did in fact loved me, who cared for me and who tried to help me. I rejected them all. I forgave no one.

It took me four terms in prison (the fourth of a 25 to life sentence) to finally come to grips with myself, with society and with the ability we all possess to simply forgive. Nearly 30 years wasted trying to keep that oath I made to myself while I sat on the edge of that pier.

Side note: Usually I use these picture themes as a way to compose some creative work of fiction. However, this is sadly a piece of nonfiction. I saw this picture and, although it is set in a different geology and built differently, it was a reminder to me of that pier at Cottonwood Cove on the Colorado river and the last beating my father gave me.

P.S. my sin that night was that I was overheard wishing to run away.
