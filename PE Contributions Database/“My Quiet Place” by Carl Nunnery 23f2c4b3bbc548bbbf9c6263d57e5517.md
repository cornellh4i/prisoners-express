**“My Quiet Place” by Carl Nunnery**

Let’s say you hear two people having a disagreement when one of them makes the comment to the other to “go take a long walk on a short pier”! What they are suggesting to the other person is to basically “go jump into the lake”. This is their remedy to end the argument, right?

On the other hand, look at it this way: to take a short walk to the end of a short pier could be quiet and peaceful, and could allow you some time alone to reflect and to do some soul searching of your own. The truth is, sometimes we do become overwhelmed and even confused by things that we may be going through in our lives, and going to a “quiet place” will allow you to step back and focus on the things that were getting you out of adjustment, where you can see things more clearly. It says in Eccl 9:17 that “words of wise are heard in quiet”.

When you desire to be by yourself, it’s not a matter of being lonely, “it’s a quiet time” you need where you can be one on one with God, to talk to him and allow God to talk to you!

It’s from this meditation and prayer time that God reveals his love and glory to you on a more personal level that shows you how to regain your perspective and prioritize the things that are troubling you, without all the daily distractions.

Now let’s talk about these distractions in your life that were causing you to lose your focus!!

Who is the one person whose goal and objective is to confuse your thinking? To cause you doubt? That’s right, it’s our number one adversary, the Devil!

First, let me say, “God is not the author of confusion” (1 Cor 14:33), this is the work of Satan, who is attacking you, and I can tell you this: Satan is dedicated to his work!

Our fight against the devil is not an easy one, but is one we can win. So when you feel the devil start to tug on your shirt tail, go to your quiet place, and tell it to God. He’s got your back and he will put the devil in his place!

God’s word is our defense against the attacks of Satan. In Psalms 109:29, it says, “let my adversaries be clothed with shame and cover them with their own confusion”. Our defense is our prayer to God in Psalms 71:1 where it says, “Lord, never let me be put to confusion”.

When you go to your “quiet place”, even sitting at the end of a pier to be alone, trust me, God will already be there waiting for you to get there, ready to pull you out of your despair, allow you to see things more clearly, and show you his love and glory!!
