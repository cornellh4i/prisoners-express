**Tricky Business by Joseph Parrish**

Do you believe that God can heal your body?

Please tell me who do you give the credit to?

Have you ever been healed of any type of sickness

Or disease? Did you ever wonder of how you were

Mysteriously healed? How long ago was this?

Do you even remember? Do you believe in healing of

The body? If so, what is your explanation?

I believe that God is the one responsible for

Healing. Not only does God heal the body he also heals

Everything. He makes all things new. God is the one

Responsible for all healing. He will not share his glory

With another. You know that old familiar saying:

“God Is good - all the time”

To believe or not to believe, is Tricky Business

Because you can trick yourself right out of the

Blessing. God is sovereign over every situation.

We’re going to have to take responsibility

For our actions. We’ve got to believe.
