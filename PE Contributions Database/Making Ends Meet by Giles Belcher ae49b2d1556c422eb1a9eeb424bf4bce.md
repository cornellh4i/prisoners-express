**Making Ends Meet by Giles Belcher**

That is a good one to try in prison!

If indigent you depend on the prison system.

Food 2-3 meals; wash clothes; toiletries.

If you have money from family, job in a Prison Industries or former SCDC job #18125-#18175 - every 2 weeks or more! Charity is grateful and helpful here. Kindness is rare and needed. Could owe money and have to do unbelievable things (unspeakable) to pay back. It’s tough back here all across the board. God’s grace, blessing, and mercy come and go as seen, and or needed. Either you have, take, steal, owe, at times do without. That’s making ends meet here in a nutshell!
