By Robert Bartlett Sr.

In the old days, I recall

The flag had fewer stars.

We knew all the causes

Of its righteous bloody wars.

In the old days, we all knew

The church deserved respect.

Liberals’ silly notions

Were easy to reject.

In the old days, just one buck

Bought eight tenths gram of gold.

We all had a standard

For what we bought and sold.

In the old days - kidding not -

I was young and free.

Now I’m just a prisoner

Writing crappy poetry.
