**“My Parents” by Ron Pavey**

I have been locked up now for almost twenty years. While I was incarcerated, both my folks have passed away. Being in here, I heard all types of horror stories of both moms and dads being neglectful to their children or even worse, doing unspeakable things to the kids.

It was these times that I realized how lucky I am to have a set of parents one can be proud of.

My parents were together for over 50 years and aside from my father being at work, they were hardly ever apart. My dad had an impeccable work ethic and was very respected and known for his work as a small engines mechanic. I remember him starting his business in 1963 with two chainsaws, two lawnmowers and two mowers you walked behind to mow. He turned this into a million dollar company

My mama always had breakfast on the table for him as well us kids. Supper was waiting when he returned home from a long day of work. The few times they argued involved him being at “the store” too much. The fights never last long and never turn violent. Many times it would end with dad dropping his head and saying “Yes Dear.” Don’t get me wrong, dad wore the pants in the family, but he loved mama deeply and would admit to being wrong only to her.

While the deaths of a child would tear many couples apart, the deaths of my older (by one year) twin brothers just strengthened their marriage bond. Neither blamed the other. God, I just needed them back quicker than expected. The two babies only lived a few hours but stayed forever in our lives. I remembered as a kid, the entire family (now 5 kids) and our folks would walk the ten minutes or so to the cemetery and visit the twins. The trauma of the loss turned mama’s hair white overnight, but she was stronger than any of us gave her credit for.

Neither were ever unfaithful to the other. It was not even considered. They did not not smoke or do drugs. I had never seen my dad drunk. Mama, maybe tipsy once! A few beers once in a while were their vice and when I say once in a while, think 3 times a year-- 4 if you count New Years.

They were both satisfied with just enjoying life, family, and a quiet abundance of peace and joy within their souls. When it was dad’s time to start the next step of his journey, he passed peacefully in mama’s arms.

We all thought she would be lost without him and would soon follow but as I speak of the huge strength that she possessed, mama stayed in this world for another 13 years. She still had many more lives to brighten, whether they were family or strangers she would meet and never see but once.

She would use to say: ”If I was a better mother, you would not have done this to go to prison”

All I can say is this: If I would just listen to the wisdom and the advice of these two marvelously kind and loving people, my path would have gone another way. It was neither their fault that I made a bad choice. I have, for the past 16 years or so, tried to turn my life around to be just half the person they were. I know they are smiling down at me, proud of the person I have become.

For this gift called life,

I thank you Mom and Dad.

I’ll make the most of it.
