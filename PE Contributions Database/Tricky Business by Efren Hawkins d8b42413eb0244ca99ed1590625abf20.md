**Tricky Business by Efren Hawkins**

Life is tricky business. You never know what is going to be the spotlight of each day of your life, you awake some days and the sky is clear, but others are full of so many clouds. It’s like seeing a magic trick and trying to figure out how were they able to do that.

Also you can see it in what's going on in the world today. If you have a question, just type it Into a computer and get the answer. I remember in the past you had to search for answers. This amazes me because I still don’t know what a megabyte (probably spelled wrong) is. All I know is they give all you want to know, If you would just type it Into a computer, cellphone, or sometimes a tablet.

The decisions you make in life are truly tricky, because you never know how severe the outcome may be. Also, you don’t know who it’s gonna affect. Today, I sit In high security, because of a decision I trick myself with. A few people were affected by it. But the tricky part of it is that I had fallen into some tricky business. I was not even myself, and I don’t know the words to truly describe the transformation. It was like I became Megatron and was deceiving all those around me, but I was only tricking myself. Everyone knew that I had let myself get tricked. My advice to anyone is don’t do things that are out of character or you know is gonna lead you astray. You are not going to like the outcome. Just know that life is tricky business, that's why it’s so easy to forget who you truly are. Be who you are and stop living in that vision you think is you, because reality is hard to run from. We all have a past, but let’s not make our past become our future.
