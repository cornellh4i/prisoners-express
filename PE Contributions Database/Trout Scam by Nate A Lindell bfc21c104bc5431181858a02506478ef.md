**"Trout Scam" by Nate A. Lindell**

Man, how gullible I was when I was a child amazes me! I’ve always loved fishing, especially when I can see the fish and the fish are in a holden stream, like the trout I wanted to fish for while my family was camping in Yellowstone Park.

Lucky me, my brothers volunteered to herd the trout toward me as I cast my spinner in the stream.

I had epilepsy and must have been heavily dosed with barbiturates to not realize what was going on. I kept catching trout, one after the other, for a total of 20! Lucky me I had my brothers in the stream, unhooking the first almost immediately after I hooked them. Well, 20 fish was plenty for my family and me, so I called it a day, went over to the stringer where all the fish had been put, but found only limp trout there!

“The other ones must’ve got away,” my older brother said.

I was heartbroken but brought the remaining fish back to camp where it was cleaned . My step-dad, mom, and I ate it.

My brothers were all laughing, and when I asked why, they told me I hadn’t caught 20 fish, but they’d put the same fish on my lure 20 times.

“Well, at least I caught one fish,” I said, still smiling.

Nope. They told me they’d found the fish on a stringer left on the bottom of the stream. Worse, after we ate the trout, a guy came into our camp complaining about us eating his fish.
