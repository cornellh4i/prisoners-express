**“Tuned In To Life” by William “Jay” Sprayberry Jr.**

Have you ever felt like you weren’t really tuned in to life? I have. I just couldn’t seem to get my life right.

I never really understood what my life’s purpose was. I just went around aimlessly, never knowing what I was going to do from one day until the next.

I always had a knack for writing, but I avoided it because I was scared of failure. If I went all in with writing, and nobody enjoyed it, then what? As long as I never put my full force behind my writing, then I could say that I might be good at it if I’d just actually sit down and write something.

Words don’t write themselves though, and talent is only talent if you use it. If you never use it, it’s nothing. How can a person ignore the talent God gave them, question God on why He made them, and ever expect to be tuned in to the life he’s supposed to live?

I lived so many years feeling empty and useless. I hated myself. I became a drug addict, tried to commit suicide, and went to prison 4 times. I was the poster child for not being tuned in to what I was supposed to be doing. All because I was scared of failure.

I was on the verge of giving up again a couple years ago. Headed back to prison with an 18 year sentence. My wife had filed for divorce, after years of us not really being together. My new fiance left me. I knew that I might never see my stepdaughters again. I consider them my real daughters. They call me daddy Jay and are the closest things to children of my own that I have. I felt like what was the use of trying?

Then it hit me. I was already a failure. There was no need to be scared of it anymore. I had so many emotions, so many things I wanted to say, and the only way to get those out was on paper. Who cares if no one wanted to read what I wrote? I couldn’t hold it all inside any longer. I had to get it out.

So I started writing, and a funny thing happened. The pain and sadness never disappeared, but it lessened. I could escape this world filled with hurt and enter one that I create.

I could live happily through the characters in my stories. I finished a book called “We Were Just Kids”, and published it online at a place called [www.prisonsfoundation.org](http://www.prisonsfoundation.org/).

I started praying again. Trying to build a closer relationship to God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit. I found that as long as I wrote, prayed, and stayed in contact with my family, I didn’t need antidepressants anymore. Writing was my medicine.

People started reading my stuff, and they enjoyed it. The smiles on people’s faces when they hear my stories, the genuine interest they have in the things I write keeps me going. They make me see how much of a fool I was for not writing before.

The emptiness inside me has faded somewhat with each prayer and story. I still feel bad sometimes, but not as bad as I used to. I finally feel like I’m in tune with what I’m supposed to be doing.

We will never feel like we are in tune with the world, until we get past that fear of failure that’s so gripping that it keeps us from trying. A little fear is healthy, but too much fear is suffocating.

What scares me more now is the thought of what I would have been. If I had never decided to finally take this leap of faith and confidence, then I’d still be the person I was before I got here. It would be twice as hard to wake up at 70 and realize I have so much to say still, so many dreams I never went after, and not enough time to complete them.

If you’ve got something you feel like you should be doing, but are too scared to try or think that there’s always tomorrow, don’t put it off another day. That could be the thing that helps tune you into a life where you’re truly happy. Tomorrow might come, but then it might not. Let’s not wonder what we could be, but tune in to what we are right now. Right now’s the only thing we have that’s guaranteed.
