**“Flying” by Lance Ellis Porter**

As a young boy my soul was free it soared with endless whimsical possibility. As the days, weeks, months, and years passed with me in a frenzy to reach maturity I became weighted down.The drudgery of expectations, timelines to be met and the burden of responsibility clipped my wings.The boy who soared was no more.

My outlook on life became resentful it’s no wonder when once I had beautiful wings and could fly and everything was possible to my eye. No matter what I do the skies just aren’t as blue, the sun shines dull when once it was a warm golden orange of a child’s coloring.

In my rage I now find myself in a cage… wingless waiting to die so once again I may fly.
