**“Believe It or Not” by Trey Boone**

When I was 20, I had a very strange experience. I was either possessed by an evil spirit or I had a psychological breakdown or the third option, which is a combination of the two.

I was living with my dad and aunt at the same time in a decent doable wide trailer. I had been using K2, taking antidepressants, and smoking cigarettes. One day, I got the bright idea to just stop everything cold turkey, which would definitely support the mental instability theory.

For a couple of weeks, things got weird. THinking back on it, it was like just watching myself do these things. I was in the backseat; someone or something was driving.

Now the crazy thing I thought and did. I wouldn’t eat meat or much at all really. I was losing weight and I believed I was getting physically stronger for no reason. I could hear voices like people arguing outside a closed door. I couldn’t make out any words though.

I went fishing and thought I could control the bugs, frogs and fish with my mind… yea, I know. I would go out to the storage shed in the middle of the night and just sit there sitting in the dark, listening to the murmurs. I wanted to watch angel and demon movies like “Constantine” for instance. I still like that movie. I felt invincible.

The scariest part is I went and bought a machete from Walmart. For what, I still don’t know. The day after, things came to a peak.

As I was laying down trying to sleep, I met the darkness directly. For some reason, I had lit a candle and put it on the dresser in the middle of the room. Once again, just watching myself.

Falling asleep didn’t feel like falling asleep. It felt like I was sinking to permanent darkness. It felt bad; worse than death. Lying there on that twin mattress in the dark, I was losing me.

Just when I had no more of myself to fight with, someone else fought for me. I said, “Jesus, help me”; nothing more. The candle light flickered and it felt like a weight jumped off me. I was shocked. I sat up and placed my feet on the floor. As I did so, I saw a black shadow slide into the floor vent at the edge of the mattress. Real or hallucinations?

The fog was gone, totally gone. It was amazing; I was free and light as a feather. I still don’t know what to believe. What is truth, and what can we make of it? What side will you choose? I know.
