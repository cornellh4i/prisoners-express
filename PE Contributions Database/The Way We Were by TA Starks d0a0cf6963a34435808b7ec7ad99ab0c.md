**"The Way We Were" by TA Starks**

It was the summer of 1999 when I formed a bond with Benny, Mathew, and Travis. Before that, I was just a black kid from Chicago who was new in the small town of Anna-Illinois. It’s hard being black in a town where the population is 90% white, and being 14 in high school was no “cake-walk.”

It was said that Anna stood for “Ain’t no niggers allowed,” and by the way some looked at me...it seemed true.

I was glad I came in the middle of the school year just in time for summer break. Not only was my skin tone dark but I dressed, walked, talked and did different things then the “Townies,” and for those reasons I kept to myself. The first time I met my 3 friends was in the bathroom between 8th period. All 3 were being bullied by a senior by the name “Crash.” I was at one of the stalls hoping to stay unseen as Crash demanded petty cash from his victims. It wasn’t until I flushed the tank that Crash turned his sights on me.

“Hey, Tar-baby. Come out those black pockets of yours as well,” Crash demanded.

I said nothing as I finished washing my hands, began to move pass, but he stood in my way.

“What, you didn’t hear me, boy?” he said standing inches over me. I wasn’t scared of him at all. I came from a school where 10% out of the 85% of black kids carried guns to class. Crash was a joke to me but I didn’t want trouble so I came up with a plan.

“Look, Hillbilly. How ‘bout I pay you 50 bucks to leave these guys alone for...a month,” I propositioned. Benny, Mathew and Travis were taken aback as they stood with only a dollar or two in their hands. Crash seemed confused.

“You’ve got 50 bucks?” Crash asked me.

“Only if you chill-out on these guys.”

“50 bucks to lay-off these geeks for 30 days?” I pulled out the bill.

“Yup,” I said emotionless.

Crash shook his head with a puzzled frown but in the end took the money and told the boys--”see you dweebs in 30.”

After that the boys introduced themselves with gratitude and I told them my name.

A couple of days later into summer break I received a random visit from the boys. My mother was all smiles to see some kids finally coming over. I myself was confused as to what they wanted but also a bit cheerful that my boredom was cut short.

The boys said they wanted to hang out. They offered up “outdoorsy” activities that didn’t sound too fun to a “city-boy” like me so instead I invited them up to my attic-suite of a room where we played PS1, Nintendo 64, looked at some girly mags and chatted about our lives until evening.

After that first day together we were together almost every single day that summer. Benny, Mathew and Travis admitted that they weren’t in the company of many black people but assured me that they weren’t racist...and I believed them. By the end of the summer we forged a bond like no other and our dreams for the future included one another. We were friends. We were brothers.

What really made us close was when Crash finally showed back up demanding “bully-money” I unleashed a can of “woop-ass” upon him in front of the entire 9th grade body. Yes I was given 10 hours after school detention, but it made me popular, stopped the bullying and made my boys proud.

“Today we honor our buddy Donte for slaying the Crashinator…” Travis said, “...we celebrate with smokes as we cross over as men amongst children.” He handed each one of us a cigarette. None of us had ever smoked. “No-no-no,” I waved taking Mathew’s camera, “I’m already a man. Let me be the one to capture this most...transmatic moment in history.” The boys huddled up, put their cigs in their mouths and smiled as I snapped their picture.

That was in the summer of 1999...when we were young...and innocent.

15 years later we don’t see each other too much. We’ve all moved away. Benny lives in Miami-Florida where he runs a nightclub for “gentlemen.” We speak here and there over the phone. Mathew moved to New York where he works as a Journalist for the online-times. He lives with his husband of 2 years. I attended the wedding, but we don’t speak as much these days.

Travis moved to California where he runs a tech-firm. He’s rich, has a wife and two kids and has a slight drinking problem. We keep in contact the most.

As for me, I fell on hard times after high school. Picked up some bad habits and landed in the state pen. I’m out now. I wrote a novel that was loosely based on my time in the small of Anna. The book went viral online through E-books, and I’m now in Aspen-Colorado writing my next one.

The picture I took of my friends sits on my desk as a constant reminder of the youthful years of time past. I smile sometimes and reminisce...on the way we were.
