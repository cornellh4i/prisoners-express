***Emily* by LeRoy Sodorff**

With a handle on above,

and holding up her end,

The storms of life gather,

As those clouds of doubt roll in.

Under this wet blanket,

Clothed in humility,

Is an unassuming spirit,

Of peace and tranquility,

Hopelessly unaware,

This teenage wait,

Stands on the edge,

Awaiting her fate
