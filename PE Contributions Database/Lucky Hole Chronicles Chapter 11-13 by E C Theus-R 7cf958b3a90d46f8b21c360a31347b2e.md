**Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 11 by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

Victor was lost all by his lonely. Well, almost. Of course Old Man Sanchéz was there with him. “No papá, Julio isn’t mad at you,” said Victor warming his body next to a boiler, “he’s just in his sentimientos o algo así. Pues, ya lo sabes como es él…” 

The basement was frigid. While the thaw was in full swing at the surface. Forty-plus-feet below ground, not even the twelve industrial boilers and other running machinery could beat out the chill. More than one person had died trying to find what lie below Lucky Hole ground zero. Now, Victor walked up and down sickly, yellow-lit corridors, from subterranean banker to subterranean bunker to─

“Ey papá, ¿qué tenemos allá?” asked Victor. There, far off down a passageway, a strong light was surging behind the frosted glass of a heavy-looking door at the end of the hallway.

Midget was beyond pissed. “Fucking greed. F─cking Tonka. F─cking prison, f─cking heroin whores, f─cking, f─cking…” and on went Midget’s litany of all the f─cking people and things he suddenly couldn’t stand. His elbow was the size of a tennis ball. Staffe Inrection. 

“At least I hope,” thought Midget, “if it’s Mercer… Ah f─! I need my arm; I’m right handed for f─’s sake!” Greed was still M.I.A., maybe he’d offed like most of the woods suspected. Tonka was unaccounted for; probably offed himself too. S─ was that f─cking bad. How many times could a guy get stabbed before he just said, “f─ it all?” He hadn't figured it out yet. He was draining his elbow next to Plymouth Rock, lost in his own world of f─cking woe.

“I ever tell you,” said someone from behind him, “you cuss too f─cking much?”

Midget spun around, banging his legs against the boulder. Down he went along with his shank and gauze for drainage. Of all the people, there stood Greed; speak of the devil… Greed surveyed their surroundings then, he said, “Some on. Got meds for that and we got work to do. I’m getting us out.”

“Papá… Yo no puedo creerlo, no se puede ser verdadero, ¿no?” Victor’s warm breath was fogging the opaque glass compounding his disbelief. “Papá, esto no puede ser. I don’t believe it… a train…”

But that’s what it was a real, actual train. Not an old-fashioned, coal-burning chugger. More a commuter, high-tech electronics, self-propelled train. Only the heavy door separated him and Old Man Sanchéz from freedom. Victor’s fist pounded, his feet struck out, his voice raved; in short, he went beserk.

“Alrighty then,” said Murphy. "He definitely looked the cat who ate the cream. The dying had slowed down, the wars had stopped, fools were starting to realize their last days could be spent trying to escape instead of finished old grievances. I was ‘healthy,’ meaning walking under my own power and had managed to bite my tongue long enough to have an ace or two to play. Now the time had come inside the admin’s offices. I’d figure it out the day you grabbed me in the library sleeping. It’s crazy nobody ever thought about it, you know?“

“Talk faster,” replied Murphy. It was simple. Obvious after you think hard on it. Teresa’d told them the helicopter only held eight people plus a three man flight crew, so eleven total, at max. Every morning there's only those flights arriving to Lucky Hole; 24 guards. But there's another fifty-odd-something employees and administrators and teachers and medical staff and personnel, Monday through Friday. Where did they all come from? Lucky Hole had no gates. Where did all the livestock and supplied and foodstuff come from? They only flew in guards or tours. I had Murphy’s full attention. He was buying any and everything I was selling, no questions asked. I finally said, “so I knew there had to be an underground road or highway. The boilers, heaters and a gang of other s─ is all underground, right? Out of the whole damned pinta, where the only place we never go?”

Rafa still couldn’t believe it. Vic was desaparecido. Nobody’d even heard a whisper about him. Then, Gerogie too, had fallen into a void, un vacío profundo. He’d been gone even longer. Everyone’d though the worst: he’d walked the line under all hr stress. At least they’d believe it till Rafa told them about the elibrary. Ol’ Georgie Boy was built of stronger hierro that Mast knew, but Rafa knew. Rafa wanted to go back to the library, pick up the trial, Julio agreed. Eli couldn’t much else besides agree. He had to keep their plans in motion. Greed still had to die; Killer Keith’s clan was at the gates; Louie and Abdul needed to be dealt with. Plus, he still needed Manuel to hit the lick on medical ─ Murphy’s territory. Eli said, “dále qas pendejos. Just don’t f─cking disappear too, ¿no?” Manuel left with Julio and Rafa at dusk. They spilt ways outside the library, “cuidate compa.”

“You guys do the same,” said Manuel, seeping into the darkening shadows.

Murphy was floored. His mouth hung open as if I’d broken his jaw. For those few seconds I don’t even mind his halitosis. I might’ve grown two heads the way he was staring at me. I know it was only seconds but it could’ve been hours. I watched Murphy’s narrow, beady eyes. Watched his dull mind kick and sputter into action. Saw the wheels grinding after so much time inactive. I could even feel their straining against the dumb brute they were imprisoned in. It looked painful, but díos mío, I enjoyed it. Petty as hell but─

“So… you’re telling me…” Murphy was shaken, uncertain, “...you’re saying there really is an escape?”

“Yeah,” I said thinking, “God in Heaven let there be an escape from this hell hole.”

Victor awoke and sorry was he to do so. His throat felt raw and swollen. It was difficult to get a full breath. His arms felt leaden, same as his legs ─ just dead weight. His head soon followed, letting him know in binding, mind-splitting pain it was still attached, unfortunately. Then, he noticed the speckles of blood edging a couple of respectable sized pools at his sides. His last coherent thought, “I’m about to die.” His face met the uprushing concrete ground.

I’d lost all interest in Murphy the second I heard the first muted sounds. A fight? Sounded like a good one. Then, bodies thudded against the closed doors. Murphy jumped three feet out of his chair. Beggings, screams, plenty of cursing too. Murphy rushed to lock the door. It swung open. Tonka and Murphy faced off. The one smeared with blood, his shirt torn and his own blood dripping, weapon in hand. The other… Well, he looked like he’d just gave birth to triplets. Tonka rushed in, followed by two other woods armed with club and hammer. Murphy squealed, squealed like the stuck pig he was. I’d only heard a high-pitched shriek like that once in my life. The last thing I wanted was a reminder of Murphy's tender care. Yet, I sat there mesmerized as they stabbed him, clubbed and flattened his skull. Listened as the screamed cut short and the only sounds was Tonka’s knife driven hilt deep, pulled out in a sickening wet, meaty sound. I couldn’t have run if I’d needed to, all I could do was watch. Watch three men kill my tormentor. I’m ashamed to say it, but I’ve never been happier in my life. Yeah, I’ll have to go to confessions for this. If not, I’ll probably burst into flames if I step into another church.

The human body was an amazing thing. Its capacity for reselience surpassed all bounds of comprehension. While Murphy was true and dead. Victor, on the other hand, was alive, in pain and mad. After some four hours of unconsciousness he struggled upright, teetered a moment then, launched himself single-mindedly into the cracked glass door. He’d lost control, lost all cognizance, his world existed of the door and train and tracks beyond. Over and over, again and again. Pained, blinded by his tears, his strength flagging. He let loose a barbarian, savage outcry and rushed headlong.

“Georgie Boy,” said Greed, “you can thank Midget here for finding you…” I would’ve thanked the zombie of Houdini has he said so “...but now, I need your help…” His eyes were predatory, “which ways out?”

There’s always somebody paying attention. Somehow, somebody always seems to find out in prison - is there no such thing as a secret? I’d gone from thankful and relieved to dread in a couple of words. What else had Midget, the good Samaritan, heard? Obvious, he’d heard me screaming about escape; it’s why I was surrounded by gabachos, reminded me of a military tribunal or something. Did I want to risk my life twice on a hunch? Uh, duh, f─ no! So, I did the only thing I could do.

Abdul looked grimey. He felt worse, caked with days of old dirt, mud, dried blood, sweat and just filth. He dragged himself from their headquarters, slowing marching toward the washroom. Washing with hand sanitizer was a serious chore. It irritated the scabs, compounded the rashes in sensitive areas and left a residue that seemed to attract more dirt and grime. They couldn’t shave, even if they wanted to, there were no razors. Besides, there wasn’t anybody to be presentable for. Their water supply was low, lower still than they’d planned with all the injured and sick they now had. There were dissenters daily, hourly. The war was over for them, but a select few maintained a fatalistic determination. Looking at the stranger in the mirror, Abdul said, “great and merciful Allah, let me take as many of them I can with me.”

Desperation has a way of driving people beyond all bounds of ingenuity. Julio said, “Mira, I’m looking at it like this...they only shoot at the line,” a history book between them, “you walk the line and bang! ¿No?”

“Sí, desde luego, pero yo no lo sé acerca de esto…”

“No me des nada de ─”

“Julio! Julio, Rafa!” came somebody’s shout. Julio was out of his chair spinning to face the threat. Rafa was quicker being on wheels. They were shoulder to hip when Manuel came in with the whole gang.

“What ─” said Rafa.

“Them blancos just slaughtered Murphy and Georgie’s there too. I guess Murphy kidnapped him and ─” Manuel stopped short as Rafa and Julio rushed past.

Victor was dead, or at least wished he was. Glass shards, blood all dried making him look like a thorny lizard. The pain burst in on him, overwhelming his senses. Tears burned in his eyes where slivers of glass had embedded themselves. He looked at the door forbidding him freedom. ‘I’ve failed,’ thought Victor. The pain was too much. He dismayed, cursing the Heavens making his pain tenfold. Exhausted, he cleared his wounded eyes of glass. He blinked ten, twenty, fifty times in disbelief. He was staring down the hallway lit with a sickly yellow glow. Behind him was the train, before him was hell. The train, he’d made it; he hadn’t failed. Victor sat lost in what to do next. It was an hour and forty minutes later when he came back to his senses. The train was chugging along at a nice, sedate pace, its air conditioning blowing sweetly, stirring the quiet. Alone. Alone, after so many years of never being alone, having no privacy, not even to sleep. The quiet was deafening.

“Go back,” said the tiny voice in his head, “go back. Don’t leave your brother. What about Georgie?”

“Brother? Psst..What brother, the one who abandoned me? ¡Vaya al diablo! Pues, además, Georgie Boy está muerto ya. That was my only family,” thought Victor, rebuffing his conscience, “Ol’ Georgie Boy has to be dead…there’s no other explanation.”

“So, Georgie Boy,” said Greed, leering, “I’ll give you um...let’s say five, no, four. Four minutes to tell me how I get the f─ out of here.”

Georgie knew an ‘or else’ was implied. He knew also that that ‘or else’ would be painful.
