**"Island" by Shaun Blake**

They say I'm a crazy wanderer. But, that's only because they don't understand me; they don’t see the whole of me. My path takes me to where the wind blows, where the cold lies, and where the past follies away. I avoid human contact as I journey enjoying the peace. In fact, I once shared a campfire with an old soldier. He talked so much that he left me no choice but to creep away soon after he went to sleep. I left him as far behind as my slow pace permitted.

I walk with a limp and stoop toward the right over my walking staff. I take my time not inclined to hurry. I believe humanity has gotten ahead of itself, leaving reality behind. This is the company I myself leave behind. Forced to learn how to be alone, how to be self-sufficient, I'm a man in my mid-forties willing to eat salt fish three meals a day, not worrying about what other people think. Not much of a Romeo left in me either. My race is only with myself and that is hard enough.

It seems like I've been searching for my niche in life for an eternity. But this chapter only started three years ago when I first heard about the island. A magical place of healing to be found only by the worthy. Illusive as it has been, I've finally found it. Or maybe it's more like I've finally become worthy enough for it to show itself to me.

I stand atop a low berm looking down on the shore of the Delphine Sea and out across Tranquility Bay at Sanctuary Island. I know this is it even though I've never seen it.

Walking to the shore I contemplate how I'm going to get out to it. There's no sign of any human presence and no boat. But there's plenty of driftwood about, so I gather some together and construct a make shift "raft" with some rope I find in my pack.

Skeptically I push it in the water and to my surprise, I make it to the island-soaked, tired, and hungry, but alive.

I pull myself and the raft shore looking around. Everything has a film of ancientness to it: the beach, the sparse vegetation, the three trees, and what looks like a manmade entranceway to a cave dwelling or crypt. Hopefully, the former.

My first inspection leads me to find a spider-infested cave with signs that it was once inhabited by another fellow human. There was a chamber approximately 15' by 16' and about 6 ft high, a hollowed out shelving along the back wall big enough to use for a bed, a broken chair carved out of stone, and a rotting driftwood table. The ground is fairly flat and the walls are smooth except for the few storage shelves and some writing and pictures carved in the rock. A family of mice seems to have made a nice home for themselves in the back corner of my future bed-platform and likewise, other animals seem to have taken refuge in this cave. Since I myself qualify as a refugee, I should fit right in. With a few fixes, replacement of the furniture, eviction of the homesteaders, and cleaning, it will be perfect.

While fixing everything up and doing a good cleaning, I search the rest of the island. I find a small spring not far behind the cave entrance flowing into a pool. It's surrounded by two lemon trees, a eucalyptus tree and some wild grapes. Other than these, the island is desolate, roughly shaped and small enough to be traversed in the time it takes the sun to move a quarter hand-span.

A fortnight after arriving I float my reinforced raft back to the mainland and walk for two days up the coast before I come to a fishing village. Making friendly, but vague inquiries into the local area, I barter for a few garden seed, a couple of goats, and a few chickens. As I make conversations with these locals, I find out that my island doesn’t exist! There isn't a single soul who can confirm that there is an island two days walk to the south. Not only no island, but none of them have even heard of a bay either!

It's been six years since then and the island's claim on me. Its locality doesn’t exist so I'm quite safe from discovery. I love it here. The chickens and goats seem content and are surprisingly good company. The garden has flourished, the lemon trees produce big lemons, the grapes are plump and juicy, and the eucalyptus tree provides shade and medical aid need be. The weather is never too bad, and under the island's influence, I find myself content. With the cave's entrance facing the west, I enjoy the sunsets in comfort, like how I am now.

Every year at this time, the tree leaves rustle and blow away, dusk falls early and the temperature drops to near freezing at night. I watch the wind pick up just enough to smooth the bay along with the sandy shore. This has become my favorite time. There's a comforting sense of isolation. Not only do I not feel caged, but I feel freer than I've ever been. Contentment whispers to me in the wind. I see through a clearer light. The sweet air is suffused with the perpetual smell of the surrounding sea air. This is why I came here. I wished to live naturally, to face only the essential aspects of life, and see what I could learn. I had lived in isolation before, but t left me empty. I was dying in that previous state like I was fading into nothing.

For three years I existed alone in a prison cell. Survival. Survival was my only goal, what kept me going. I was told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. If I didn’t comply I was either beaten or starved. I was forced into that position of compliance.

Here I choose isolation happily. I'm free to leave or to stay. This is what gives me purpose now: my ability to choose my own existence without restriction.

This is why I'm still here. Because I choose to be!
