**“Windows” by Delvin Diles**

Karen Fisher approached Elizabeth Morris and her entourage as they left the bar.

“Congratulations, Ms. Morris.”

Feeling good about her celebrated win in court for her latest high profile client, smiling Beth turned around to thank her. Upon seeing who it was her smile evaporated as quick as it appeared. She still managed an apprehensive, “Thank you. Ms Fisher.” Breaking the silence, Karen Fisher, the woman that everyone in Beth’s clique recognized as the one that filed charges of sexual assault against Beth’s latest client, NFL- wide receiver Antonio Green, explained, “Look, I just wanted you to know that I don’t hate you.” Locking eye contact but with a crack in her voice she continued, “I just gotta ask: How can you keep your conscience intact, knowing you represented a man who is now free to go on victimizing women?” Before Beth could respond, Karen walked past them out the door. Exchanging the same shocked expressions, Beth and her 3 friends, Michelle, Chelsey, and Faith let the scorned woman’s wake fadeout before they left The Honey Pot.

In the parking lot the reprimands flew: Michelle shouted, “Who does she think she is, stalking you like that?!”

Chelsey, the most agreeable of the bunch seconded, “Right?!” Who does that?”

Faith warned, “Beth, you might want to hire a bodyguard after this, hon.”

After having taken several deep breaths to slow her pulse rate, Beth finally spoke her mind, “Wow. The trial ended 4 days ago. How long has she been following me?”

In the parking lot, one by one, the women hugged and consoled their clearly shaken friend. Before releasing her Michelle reassured, “If she was telling the truth, her statements would’ve been consistent with the footage. Don’t let her get to you, Beth.”

“I won’t”.

On the drive home, Beth kept checking her rear view for any followers. After several turns, she decided no stalkers tailed her.

Pulling into her condo’s lot, Beth’s mood shifted from worry to anger. Who the hell does she think she is, hunting me down?! She thought. She considered a restraining order, gun purchase, and Faith’s suggestion of a bodyguard. She needed to be more prepared.

But if she was honest with herself, the woman hadn’t been threatening. Her demeanor was calm, resolved. Her tone, sad. Like someone struggling with a broken heart.

On the ride up the elevator to her floor, Beth replayed some questionable elements of Karen’s claims in court. Floor 1- Karen claimed not to remember much from the night of her client’s yacht/sex party. Floor 2 - She claimed she must have been drugged. Floor 3 - The footage showed her sober, walking up to the doorman that gave all the women boarding a retinal scan and explanation of the agreement they were making coming to the sex party. This too, Karen did not recall.

Exiting at her floor Karen thought, Yeah, right.

She was convinced that Karen was just another gold digger looking to cash in on a rich athlete. This was the obvious conclusion that got her client acquitted. Case closed. But as Beth walked into her empty flat, dropped her keys on the counter, and sat down on the floor to stare out the window at the city skyline, all she could see was the sincere tears of a broken woman.
