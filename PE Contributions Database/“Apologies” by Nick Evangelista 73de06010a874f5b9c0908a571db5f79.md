**“Apologies” by Nick Evangelista**

There was a very famous movie released in the 70s called “Love Story.” The tagline for the movie became nearly as renowned as the film itself. “Being in love means you never have to say you’re sorry.” It would be reasonable to think that once the prison doors shut behind you, saying I’m sorry is also in your past. Of course, that is not nearly the case.

During the pre-trial and trial phase “I’m sorry” was a staple of my conversation with others. Whether it was said while speaking with friends and family or in private prayer to God, it was said no less than once a day. Imagine yourself housed in an area much smaller than the size of a football field. In that unit live no less than sixty other inmates. I did some quick math with respect to the neighborhood I was raised in. In that area, a city block, there lived a mere forty-five people. Prison is crowded. It is anything but private. Stress levels here tend to run high for many men and for just as many reasons.

I developed several preconceived notions about prison. Many had to do with what my physical surroundings would look like but many more centered around behavior, specifically how I might need to adjust mine.

I had perceived, wrongly in this case, that I should not show weakness by apologizing. After all, isn’t that what Hollywood would have us think, that prison is a Darwinian-like setting where the weak do not survive? To be sure, there are certainly a few individuals who do practice that behaviour, but for the most part, the film and TV scripts are just that, scripted.

I was fortunate enough to be placed in a Character Based Unit (CBU). A relatively new concept in the South Carolina system. The CBU model attempts to place certain inmates together in a safer environment with the understanding that our conduct and behaviour must be above and beyond that of other units. I feel that this model allows one to be more genuine without fear of reprisal. So it seems for now that my pre-incarceration notions were unfounded.

Being very new to prison and the CBU itself, I’ve found the need to apologize quite often in the last few days. Not that my conduct was out of line or my behaviour was suspect, but the new way of life and the rules that apply come with a bit of a learning curve.

Something as benign as turning your sheets in to be laundered on a certain day early cost a night of being locked down in my cell. Apologies to the sergeant and to the inmate in charge of laundry spared me that punishment. Thankfully, my “Mea Culpa” was met with an “it’s ok” reply. I’ve learned that every apology in her is not always met with a reassuring reply.

In fact, I’ve also learned that while I may deserve an apology from a staff member for being slighted, it neither came nor should it be expected in the future. I’m learning that in prison, the concept of an apology and the anticipated forgiving response is not always a two-way street.
