**Untitled by Lorraine Kenitzki**

Of all the strange things to see on any given day!

What was this fox doing anyway?

The goose was so much bigger than the predator.

I really don’t know what to say.

Did the fox expect the fowl to play?

Or was its eyes too big for its own stomach>

Thinking it could catch such prey.

Maybe there’s eggs in the pram,

Or the goose just a plastic sham?

I wonder if the fox knew what to do,

If it ended up with the goose anyway?

On its tippy toes

in the back

Pulling itself up so high

to give a look see

Inside.

Or was this part of a movie set,

For some Narnian film show>

Oh boy! I’ll just bet,

All my grandkids will want to know,

What drives this lil’ fox so!

To take it’s life into danger,

With people’s carriages,

on city streets!

With human beings,

and their precious baby seats!

Was it lured by the smell of milk from the baby’s bottle?

Or was it some anthropomorphic moment, and I thought the fox would open up full throttle?

Taking stroller, goose, baby, and all,

Down the sidewalk to a shopping mall?

Pretty and clean.

Like a baby’s carriage should be,

I really never ever thought I would see,

Or even a fox pushing a stroller!

Or even, a fox taking a peek inside,

This infant’s roller!

Guess I’ll just have to look around me,

This sight right before me?

Or has someone put whiskey

In my coffee,

Or LSD!
