**Young Men On Couch by Johnny Lee**

It was the day that changed my life. I know that’s cliche to say, but in this case, it was true. I was given a picture of myself, my boyfriend Tommy and my friend Patrick, sitting on my couch with empty booze bottles and beer cans and other drinking equipment behind and I was squinting at the camera.

Patrick had been promoted at work, so we decided to celebrate. It was quite a party and Boy, Howdy, did we celebrate! I myself was not a drinker. I did like to drink occasionally, but I had never been drunk. I wanted to see what it was all about, so I did.

I started with an American-made locally brewed beer. It was good! Crispy would be the word I would use to describe the beer. It tasted like fall. Some would call it Autumn.

Tommy had decided that if I were to get drunk, then our friend Michael would videotape the event. Michael also took a few photos.

Tommy had started playing me with Jack and Pepsi, and I don’t like Coke. Then, it was Sans-Peppi. I decided I liked Jack. He was a great guy from Lynchberg, Tennessee.

I then did some shots of something that was not an English word, but it sounded exotic. I cannot tell you how many I drank though.

There was some talking by Patrick, Tommy and Michael, but a lot of goners truly. I had the right to remain silent, but did not have the ability. Oh my, what we learned about what I was thinking.

First, I delved into the sexuality of my cousin’s boyfriend, Kim, who was a hottie. I tried to call him and I left a message on his answering machine with my concern of his sexuality.

I then moved on to talk about Tommy’s Aunt Clarie, who I obviously do not like, her being uppity and all. Hate is such a strong word, but maybe it was the right one. I decided that poor women with coarse long legs that I generally do not like. Good thing we were not on the Set O’ Clock News!

I drank and talked, mixed drinks, mixed metaphors all at the same time. I was good and drunk. It was then I felt the need to urinate. So to the bathroom with Tommy, Patrick and Michael we went. I stood up, wobbled, missed the first step, then the second step, so I decided to, yes, you guessed it, crawl to the bathroom , but because my lover and friends are such generous gentlemen, they carried me as far as they could to our bathroom.

I did my business, and we giggled about our inebriated state. The three of us clowning for the camera.

Then, I felt a gurgling coming from my stomach. I am a pretty intelligent guy, so I knelt down and started throwing up. Boy Howdy, did I throw up, but not really in the toilet. I think everything I had eaten since was thrown up. Oh yeah, did I tell you I had never been drunk before?

After our bathroom trip, I decided I was done and went and sat on the couch with Patrick beside me and Tommy on the other end. Michael took the famous photo. Tommy seems to be hanging his head in shame, Patrick with a smirk on his face with his arms around my shoulders.

We stayed home for the party, but… On Saturday I had a hangover that lasted through church on Sunday. I was in a foul mood and watched the video on Saturday night with a Pepsi and popcorn. I apologized to Lori and Kim for my phone message. They laughed at me and said “no problem.”

I am still friendly with Aunt Clarie, but as far as I know, she’s never seen the video, so she doesn't know I dislike her and her uppity ways.

When asked by Tommy and looked at the photos Michael took, I said, “Ah, it was great and so much fun, I don’t see how people do that every weekend.” I then promised Michael and Tommy I would never get drunk again. I have kept that promise for over thirty years. I only occasionally drink a mason jar of Shine.
