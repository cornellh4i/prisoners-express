**“A Wonderful Night” by David Brown**

As we put on our finest, I couldn't help but notice her smile. Picture perfect, not one hair out of place, not one eyelash uneven. She stared at the mirror, not seeing it smile back while I stared at her. “Are you ready babe?” I asked.

“About as ready as I’ll ever be, let me grab my purse,” she replied.

I opened the door as she walked away. I waited for her to return thinking, “this is going to be a wonderful night.” She returned with confidence and walked past me as I stood in the doorway mesmerized. She had to turn around to ask me if I was OK.

“I’m better than OK,'' I replied. “I am in love with you and I am caught up in the moment.” She walked back up to me and said, “In that case, let me give you this.” She kissed me and said, “Now you’re un-caught, let's go. We have to get good seats.”

I snapped back, but not out of my trance. I pulled the door shut and followed her like I was in La-La Land.

She said, “babe you didn’t lock the door.”

She has a way of making me forget my name sometimes. I walked back up the sidewalk, locked the door, and snapped a “white rose” from our rose bush. She smiled as I walked towards her with it. I leaned in towards her with it and she leaned towards me. I slid the rose in her hair beside her left ear. I opened her door and grabbed her hand as she sat softly. Walked around, got in and drove off.

We arrived at WES (where everyone smiles) before schedule so we could get our usual seats. She didn't know that I had paid in advance for us to get front row seats. The same table as our first night. I pull out her chair and waved for the water (Steve). He knows our usual so he doesn’t walk over, he just brings our drinks within minutes. I sat down and watched her smile. I’ve always placed her between me and the stage so I can watch them both at the same time. If she knew why I placed her chair there after all this time, she’d just smile even bigger.

Tonight we got a surprise even though we go to WES twice a month. I wrote 2 poems that would be read back to back… “Falling in love” and “Every second.” As our drinks arrived, I asked her to stand for a dance.

“No one is dancing, they’re all listening to the host,” she replied.

“I know, that’s exactly why I want you to stand.”

“Couples, we have a special couple in the house tonight.” There’s a woman with a white rose behind her ear… “these words are for you.”

“Baby, what is... “

“Shh..”

Falling in love

If you're not ready for this tell me.

I may be going overboard and it’s early on so this is maybe one sided

This is how I feel.

Every second

Even when I sleep you cloud my mind like I am surrounded by fog

You take away my breathe like the winter frost

You hypnotize me like a swinging chain

You keep me on my toes like I’m on edge

You make my heart beat fast like a winded runner

You make me want to say “I Love You” every second, like a scratched record.

As she remained speechless, I spoke up.

“I don’t come here for the drinks. I don’t come here for the entertainment. I come here because you like to come here. This night would still be special without none of this as long as I have you. It is only you that makes this night and every second special for me .

Thanks for the wonderful night.”
