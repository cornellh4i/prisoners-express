**“The Tail of the Scorpion” by Edward Cortez Williams Jr.**

Accidental death. The authorities had ruled her husband’s death an accident. How could that be possible when she was staring at the killer right now? Rivka was willing to bet all $500,000 that she would receive from the settlement that Mr. Renoir, the man she was staring daggers at, had staged the car “accident.”

Was he really that arrogant? Did he actually believe that he could cross Rivka Uzi Hashem and live to tell about it? Did he seriously think that he could hide behind American money? No bank account, no matter how deep and wide, could shield him from what she was about to unleash.

Rivka was no ordinary woman. She practiced a rare Middle Eastern form of Kabbalah called B’rakhot Shiga’on. The Blessings of Madness. The point of “regular Kabbalah” was to enlighten the mind of the individual. Oh, he would be enlightened all right. He would be enlightened to a horror that would rip his mind apart. For closing her husband’s eyes, she would open Mr. Renoir’s eyes to a whole other world. Poke the scorpion, reap the tail.

Maybe he didn’t believe in such things. After all, the world was full of garbage that was passed off as “real.” Horoscopes, crystals, incense, tarot cards, crystal balls, palmistry, voodoo, and more. All foreign nonsense. Shiga’on was nothing like that gentile trash. He would soon see.

Rivka glared at the man through her thin black veil. She had three more days to sit shiva, to mourn. Then she would strike.

“Let’s see if the ten million dollars you got from this ‘accident’ was worth it.”
