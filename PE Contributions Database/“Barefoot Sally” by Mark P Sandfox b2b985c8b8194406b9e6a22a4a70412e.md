**“Barefoot Sally” by Mark P. Sandfox**

It was a foggy day. The railroad track disappeared into the haze a few blocks away. The year, 1974, two-cent bubblegum, five and dime shops, and the All Day Sunday Bus Transfer. Pete, no one called him Peter, was twelve, lanky and awkward, long blonde hair hiding his too big for his head ears, sky blue eyes atop a too big for his face nose, but his smile could melt icicles. The standard attire of the day: bell-bottom jeans, white t-shirt and sneakers, no one cared what brand.

Just Barefoot Sally and Pete walking hand in hand down the railroad tracks. Pete would love to tell you they were a couple, would love to tell everyone they were a couple, but they were just friends. Barefoot Sally walked the rail barefoot like a gymnast learning her balance, her saving grace was Pete’s hand clasped tightly in hers. Her shorts were too short, probably a size too small. Her little crop top showed way more than it covered. Midriff was in style then, and Sally had it down to an art. That was that, the rest was all Sally, including her exposed belly button and flat tummy that Pete could not peel his eyes from.

Most of the kids at school teased Sally for being poor; Pete loved her because she was rich. She needed no money. She could have all of his, and often did. Green eyes, freckly skin, frizzy fiery hair, she was beautiful, but she was so much more. She fished, even baited her own hook, swam faster than most boys, caught critters, played in the mud, even wrestled with Pete when they were bored. She was amazing, but she was just his friend, nothing more.

One bare foot in front of the other, Barefoot Sally walked the rail, leaning this way and that, midriff and bare legs going teeter and totter, all the while clutching Pete’s hand to counter her balance.

A horn blared from deep within the fog.

“Train!” blurted Pete.

Pete dug into his pocket with his free hand, pulling out two pennies, his last two pennies, One for her, one for him. Next week he would get twenty-five more for taking out the trash and bagging the lawn clippings.

“Stay still,” demanded Pete.

Apprehension welled in his chest as he let go of her hand. Sally was a daredevil, wild to the core, once had them jump from a bridge just because she saw it in a movie. Pete watched her, dared her to move, but her green eyes were elsewhere, fixed on the distant fog. Pete placed the pennies on the rail, mere inches in front of her bare feet.

The horn wailed again, this time much closer, a glint of its headlight peeking through the fog...really close,

Sally squeaked. Pete jumped to his feet. Sally reached out with her hands, fingers wiggling expectantly. She was stranded on the rail. Pete had piggybacked her across the jagged rocks earlier that morning.

“Hurry,” she begged.

Pete smiled. The ground began to shake.

“Kiss me,” asked Pete.

“Don’t be silly,” her fingers waved him closer. “Come get me, the train is getting closer.”

Pete gulped. “Kiss me.”

The horn blared, louder now, angry. The pennies were shaking.

“HURRY!” Sally’s eyes were frantic.

“KISS ME!” Pete had to yell now, just to be heard over the road of the engine, nearly all-consuming, fast approaching.

Barefoot Sally jumped from the rail into his arms, arms and legs wrapping him tight. She kissed him. Pete snaked his arms around her waist and hugged her for all she was worth. Her bare legs cinched tighter around his waist. Pete turned toward the train. She kissed him deep, tongue and all.

The train engulfed them, roaring right through them.

And then it was gone. A crushing silence. Everything was gone. No trees rustling in the wind. No critters scurrying in the bush. No jagged rocks. No roaring train. The rail that held her dainty bare feet, gone. Barefoot Sally, frizzy fiery hair and all, gone, gone from his aching arms. Nothing but white walls, white ceiling, white floor, and no door to be found anywhere.

“Sorry to bother you, Captain,” came a female computerized voice, “but we are nearing an asteroid field that will require your navigation.”

Ten years in space. Five years, six months and eleven days until he returned to Earth. Pete stood in the middle of the holodeck wondering what Barefoot Sally would look like today, why he had never stolen a kiss, why he never asked her to be his girl?

“Thank you Alice,” sighed Pete.

The hum of the deep space freighter vibrated under his bare feet.
