**"Castaway by Design" by Lloyd Hartley**

One of the most unique qualities that human beings possess is the ability to adapt, or even thrive in challenging situations. After twelve years of prison, some may thing I've even thrived here, but it is the challenging situations inside of myself where adaptation takes a dark, more inward turn.

Isolation is not the act of being apart from others. Others would say that I is a byproduct of introversion but I have found that isolation is really a form of self-escape. In the past year, I was diagnosed with moderate to severe Attention Deficit Disorder, a condition that id assumed was like autism or depression, one of those "boutique" afflictions of this era that only sold new drugs to abuse while explaining the failures of parents and laziness of children. I previously rationed my lifelong introversion as simply being burned out from drug abuse or a childhood spent with an unusual father.

I am on an island. Around me is paradise, a world created in my immediate perimeter that sadly, only exists in my mind. ADD is a shocking condition to have in prison, where physical isolation is frowned upon and nearly impossible to create. A physical island is moving my chair under the television, away from the tables. It is walking around people instead of with them. It is anything that keeps distractions known only to me.

I am currently in a place where medication is not allowed. While it pleases me to think that I'm not one of the millions abusing Adderall, I often daydream of a life where a simple 5 step process is no longer 1…2…5…4…3. while I would love to explain the feelings or logistics involved with ADD, it is better to write the way that I usually do, thoughts escaping into the ether of a vast ocean breeze, capturing only what my indecipherable handwriting can keep up with.

Here is a typical social interaction: A man tells me about a phone call that he made. Immediately, my mind goes to one that I had recently, and his story is lost. A key word stimulates my attention back to him, only briefly, and I want to respond- *I HAVE TO RESPOND* before this moment of clarity is gone. I interrupt, or spill an anecdote that has nothing to do with what he needs to hear. A few rounds of this Morse code chatter, and I am lost again. Awkward silence. The island awaits. Luckily the man signs before I rudely walk away.

This is the side of ADD that people never hear. Most of us think about how we deal with it. It is the standard fare of continuous inner dialogue combined with adapting to island life. "What am I going to do?" "How do I live like this?" Sometimes, a hand will reach out to pull me in, but most often, in adults who were never properly diagnosed, those hands cannot even reach the world created across such a vast sea.

When self-pity becomes monotonous, I put myself into the place of my sister…my brothers…my daughter. I wonder how they would describe me (brilliant…unique…thoughtful), but I also wonder if they would. I wonder how my sister could have benefitted from really having a big brother, or how my daughter would have loved having a dad instead of the default father that I had backed away into being. The excuse of drug usage and alcoholism as aa escape handily created the self-diagnosis of simply being burned out, forgetful, and absent physically as the result of addiction.

Now, twelve years removed from that stereotype, I talk to people that I hardly even know who call me things like "father" and "brother." I wish they would include words like "friend, "a futile attempt at medication-free redemption, but a phone call can be made from even the most remote island, nowadays. I go home in four months. I wonder where I will hide, but mostly I obsess about being exposed as the fraudulent conceiver of awards, accomplishments, and certificates that ADD minds believe they never even earned. I simply worry that their reflection in my eyes will be frightening to behold when I never bothered to look on all of the times that it mattered.

Experts say that life upon release can become a clean slate. The fear of erasure at age 52 is nothing compared to the anxiety of beginning again with different Jenga pieces. When I run from the conversations in prison, I can justify them as being trivial or something that I don’t really need to hear, but the conversations with my family will be defining. They will include themes like redemption, or trust, they will probably even include words like "I love you" or "I missed you." How do I turn away from them again when there is that uneasy silence of my wandering mind? How do I interject when my daughter is spilling the reality resulting from my 26 years of absence? How do I expose myself, or them, to the selfishness… to the choice of having spent my entire life avoiding everyone…everything…even them?

I used to think that ADD was an excuse for kids growing up in the millennial world of pseudo-relationships. Now I wonder if having a label to the reason why I run is an excuse for being me. And really, I'm just someone that I created when I learned to thrive in the isolation of distraction.

1…4…3…5…2. Just when I think that I can still get there on this long, sidetracked way home, someone says "I love you" again.

And I'm distracted…again, trying to figure out who they really love.
