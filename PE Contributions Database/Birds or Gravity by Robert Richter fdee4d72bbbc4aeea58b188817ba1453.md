***Birds or Gravity?* by Robert Richter**

****This flock of birds can prove Einstein wrong. Early models of the atom pictured electrons travelling in neat circular orbits, but we now know that this isn’t true. The universe does not act the way we think it does: it doesn’t have any absolutes. The electrons in an atom are like these birds, clouds of possibilities.

Where is the edge of the flock? We can’t pick some point or area and say a bird is always or never there. Some areas, particularly the dark areas, are very likely, others are less likely, and some are very unlikely. However, there are always stray birds. We can’t draw a line around “the flock,” but we can see an edge of sorts, a border between lots of birds and almost no birds. Nonetheless, there is no line we can draw that always encloses every single bird in the flock.

An atom isn’t a neat little ball: it’s a blurry cloud of possibilities. We can say that each of its particles is almost certainly within a certain space--the atom--but we can never say exactly where. The key word is “almost”! This is what Einstein never knew. He did his best and worst work in an era before quantum physics.

A flock of birds can teach us so much, but we need to pay attention to the facts. We see swirls like this out in space where galaxies have collided. It’s so easy for us to see that the resulting mess doesn’t have an exact edge, but it’s so difficult for us to see that each and every particle in that mess is smeared out across space as well.

If we used a longer exposure, we wouldn’t see any individual birds. Rather, we’d see a beautiful but blurry pattern. It would have a shape but no edges. Einstein never saw Reality this way. He imagined that matter somehow distorted both space and time, not only where an object was, but across distance as well. He never understood that every particle is somewhere in the Universe. The Aether is real and composed of the chance of finding every single thing that exists.

How terribly our human perceptions skew our view of how the Universe really works! Our momentary glimpse of Reality blinds us to its true nature. Instead, we allow one man’s explanation to dominate the “scientific” community. Physicists spend billions of dollars looking for such things as black holes, dark matter, and evidence of the “Big Bang” when all they need to do is open their eyes and look at the flock of birds!

Imagine that your vision was so blurry that you could never see an individual bird. You would only see flocks and their large effects. The tiny, momentary effect of a single bird might look like something completely different, yet we would see that this strange effect, with no visible cause, was always stronger near what we could see. This is exactly how gravity works.

It is not enough to just see something. Everything we see is seen through the lens of our expectations. I once saw a giant sphere in the sky, and everyone around me thought it was a UFO. I knew what it really was: a flock of birds.
