**“The Chee-Chee Story” by Matthew Tomlinson**

When I got my Forty Eight number in 1988, TDCJ gave me the ID card with a magnetic swipe strip on the back, and for 28 years, everybody I know uses their ID card for commissary. Nobody remembers the “cho-cho” days, but if you can translate enough to know what a “cho-cho” was, then let’s talk that talk about nicknames.

Young Buck was in the commissary line ahead of me, and he was telling everybody how he was getting a full sack of “wam-wams” and “zu-zus.” Oh yeah? If the kid was around in the “zu-zu” days, then he would never have gotten any “wam-wams.” What would the kid have gotten? Got! Young Buck had no notion of the 1972 *Ruiz v. Estelle*, of Special Master, or that this old goat ate plenty of VitaPro… and loved the stuff!

Young Buck went into the commissary foyer, and this old goat went in with him. Young Buck didn’t know that in 1988, I completed the Windham Electrical Trades course, and since I could wire up a 3-phase forward/reverse remote controller, I could wire up Young Buck. I casually asked him, “Say, would you ask the Commissary Girl how much Chee-chees costs? I need to buy some.”

Young Buck played it perfectly. “Um! How much are your chee-chees?”

The Commissary Girl told him to look on the price list posted by the window. And so Young Buck signed his receipt. He squished his thumbprint and grabbed his bag of--what did he say they ere? Zu-zus and wam-wams? Yeah, he Got Ghost before the Building Tenders could get on his row. Believe me, the BT would have gotten on his row and went to four-stepping head high.

I put my card through the window, and the Commissary Girl started calling items off of my list so the two trustys could get them. The old-school trustys were laughing so hard that they were about to bust a gut. She detected that she was the butt of some kind of joke: “Alright, you two clowns. What are chee-chees? Tell me.”

“Ma’am? You’re sitting on your chee-chees!”
