**Untitled by Deric Conn**

Henry the Fox was very cunning, constantly planning his next move. His neighbor was Belinda. She was a beautifully fat goose. To Henry, she was beautiful and fat enough to eat.

When Belinda first moved into the neighborhood, she would not allow Henry anywhere near her home. She did not trust in foxes one bit. Little by little, Henry manipulated Belinda into trusting him to do her yardwork. Eventually, she invited Henry to sit with her to enjoy some of her delicious sweet iced tea. Each day, they discussed their past, their hopes and dreams.

One afternoon, as they sat in the shade, sipping on Belinda’s iced tea, Belinda went inside her house to take some cookies that were baking out of the oven. Finally, Henry had his opportunity… he slipped a few sleeping pills into Belinda’s drink. When Belinda returned, she saw the plate of cookies on the table between them and took a nice long swig from her glass.

Bingo.

As Henry waited for the drugs to do their dirty work, he tried some of Belinda’s cookies. Wow. They were some of the best cookies Henry had ever tasted. As Belinda was going on about something or other, she began to nod off. Once Henry was sure that she was fast asleep, he walked over to a stroller that Belinda had used for a flower bed and dumped it onto her freshly cut lawn.

After struggling a bit, Henry got Belinda into the stroller and began pushing her towards his home. Henry noticed after a few minutes that he was feeling tired himself.

After a long yawn, Henry realized Belinda’s eyes were open and looking at him.

“Wh...what?” Henry wondered.

“Well,” Belinda began, “I remembered what type of animal you are, that you are sly and cunning. So, as I placed the cookies onto the table between us, while my wing obscured your view, I switched glasses with you.”

Then Henry remembered the sips from his drink that he took between bites. This was the first time Henry had been outwitted. Henry was fighting to keep his eyes open.

“I like you, Henry,” Belinda said, “so I regret that we must part on ill terms. But keep in mind, life is a miserable road traveled alone.

“Selfishness and deceit will always end in despair.”

Henry heard every word she spoke before he finally fell to the ground, snoring the rest of his day away.
