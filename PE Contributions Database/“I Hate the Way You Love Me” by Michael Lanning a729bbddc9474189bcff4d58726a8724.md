**“I Hate the Way You Love Me” by Michael Lanning**

When I first met you, you made me feel accepted. You made me feel special. You said wonderful words not just about me, but spoken in my ear. I was in heaven. I was loved. I gave you myself.

Your change grew over a long time together. So subtle I didn’t notice until it was too late. You were the man . You brought home the income. I thought it was natural for you to control finances. I should have been more careful. I should have stuck to your budget. I didn’t know it was wrong of me if I spent the change when buying groceries or bought you a thoughtful treat.

I never imagined you would be the type to slam doors or kick over a chair. You are always so gentle and charming. Everything I did, I did for you. You apologized. It wouldn’t happen again. You just had a bad day at work. I understand.

I made it up to you. We were good again. All was okay. So I never understood why you began making personal remarks about me, my body. Mean-spirited. Telling me I needed to slim down. Your words hurt me more than the beatings I got as a kid.

You started staying at work more. I felt abandoned, rejected. Why wouldn’t you want to come home and talk about whatever is wrong? What did I do so terrible to receive the cold shoulder, the silent treatment?

I hoped we would return to how we used to be. We went to the fair that day. On the drive over I sensed tension in you. I went to rub your shoulder. You snapped, “Don’t!” 

I cried inside. You used to enjoy my touch. I try to right my wrongs. My concern was always centered around you. I whispered, “I want to leave.” 

You grabbed my hand and said we’re not leaving yet. I didn’t mean the fair. But you didn’t listen. You paid more attention to the girl walking past you, as if I didn’t exist.

That night we argued. I was scared. I didn’t know you anymore. I needed to leave. You said no. You told me to stay. You loved me. I was tired. I wanted to leave for just a couple of days to let you cool off. I would have come back. For some odd reason, I always came back.

I never saw it coming. You embraced me from behind. Wrapping loving arms around me until I slumped into eternal sleep.
