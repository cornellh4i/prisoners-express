***Black and White Dog Staring* by Brad Perkins**

Can I trust you? I have to ask, I have been burnt so many times before. I want so badly to be able to just have someone who will treat me decent and not hurt or neglect me like all of the others have.

I can tell you what the sharp kick of a boot feels like on these scrawny ribs or the taste of antifreeze laced hamburger planted by the owner of that high falutin pure bred down by the river. BB’s, pellets, even some buckshot have all taken their toll on my ragged hide.

I have forgotten what it feels like to trust, to love… are you the one to show me? If not just leave me be, look the other way and don’t bother to whistle or make those kissy noises and give me false hope. It is getting too much to bear--any more and I’m afraid of what I will become.
