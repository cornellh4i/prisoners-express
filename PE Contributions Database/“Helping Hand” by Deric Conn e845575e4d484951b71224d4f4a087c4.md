**“Helping Hand” by Deric Conn**

The world can seem so cruel and violent

Until someone comes along and gives a helping hand.

When there is so much evil, why do we keep silent?

Won’t someone come and give a helping hand?

Where on earth is love?

Look at the genuine touch of a helping hand

Or seek his guidance from above,

For the Lord is willing to give a helping hand.

Will you pay forward, when others cry out for help?

Or do you only think of yourself?

Won’t you be someone’s helping hand?

Help the sinking out of the sand?

Don’t you know the true effectiveness of a helping hand?
