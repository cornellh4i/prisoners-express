**“The Mount of Reflection” by J.C. Young**

The gravel crunched beneath his Timberland boots as he hiked up the mountain. Martin had never been an outdoorsman, but the city life was becoming overbearing. So he sought some refuge, a little respite from the madness.

As a twenty-four year old black man, racism wasn’t a new concept to him, but this was different. This pain was direct and personal; it was the type that scraped against your heart and welle your eyes with tears. This time it wasn’t just another random grief-stricken, black woman crying at another televised press conference. This time it was Aunt Joyce teary-eyed as the press shoved their mics into her face. She was hanging onto the podium for support as she begged against further protest and riots. He, along with his sister and uncles, was flanking her and trying not to sob like infants themselves.

He stopped up the trail by a large rock and thought about his cousin Christian. Depending on whose story you believe, the witnesses or the cop, Christian was speeding. The white officer pulled him over and approached the window. Seeing the approaching officer and being in a rush to pick up his daughter from school, Christian reached toward the glove compartment for his license. Seeing a black man reaching across his dashboard, the nervous officer shot six bullets into Christian. The shots pushed his body against the dashboard, and blood oozed onto the stereo as he bled out, probably thinking about his son and daughter.

“Oh, Jesus. Kaliffa.” The words escaped Martin’s mouth in a desperate whisper, zapping the strength out of his knees and forcing him to lean against the rock to keep him from falling. Kaliffa, Christian’s daughter, was only six years old and definitely too young to be left fatherless in this God-forsaken world.

Then, Martin wept.

The tears gushed like water from a broken dam, smashing the mask of calmness he’d been wearing for the past week. It just wasn’t right! Briefly, he thought about his SUV, abandoned on the side of the road at the bottom of the hill. He’d been on his way to the funeral when--before he realized what he was doing--he’d pulled along the side of the road. It was the same road where Christian taught him to drive; he picked it because it was away from the city. “This way, you can’t run nobody off the road and have *both* of our asses in jail on some vehicular manslaughter,” Christian joked as he directed Martin.

That was the sense of humor he had; it was the kind that always infused everything with levity.

Outside the SUV, Martin stood besides the road awhile with both eyes fixed upon the expansive mountains ahead. He’d always wanted to hike those hills, a desire rekindled every time he passed by them. Well, there’s no time like the present. Better enjoy each day before you’re killed by an officer for reaching to scratch your face too fast, he thought before bolting for the mountains. That was twenty minutes ago.

Now, with the strength returning to his knees, he pushed off the rock and continued up the trail and away from the road and his car, away from the funeral and the eulogy he was supposed to give.

Although he agreed to give the eulogy, he wasn’t prepared because nobody should be giving a eulogy about his cousin. Christian should be alive! Alive and breathing, raising his kids and enjoying his family.

Already, the media had started--doing what it always did--laying the groundwork for the cop to evade accountability. Already, the major networks were tarnishing his cousin’s character in their nightly broadcasts. Some were pictures, from his Facebook page, of his holding a joint, and another one was of Malcolm X. Suddenly, Christian was a weed smoking radical. As if they, themselves, haven’t smoked on a few “dobbies” in college. Only when black males are killed by the police is the family called upon to defend the *victim’s* honor. (Apparently, black men are judged on a different scale. No rapid movements, and fight for your right *not* to be shot down like a rabid dog in the streets.) Only one network vaguely alluded to the fact that Christian was a college graduate. “There’s some indication that the victim may have attended college,” they muttered, as if that was some unsubstantiated rumor they couldn’t confirm.

And as always the case, after about a month of more biased coverage, the protest will die down and the grand jury won’t indict the officer. The subsequent “Department of Justice” investigation will find no rights violation, and that’ll be it. Another nigger dead. Oh well, please pass the salt. The American “just us” system: like it or shut up!

At the mountain’s peak, he stood for a while, gazing at the vast terrain. A lone mountain, peppered with snow, loomed off in the distance. The odd thing was that it wasn’t even close to winter. Up above, the clouds lingered and drooped. From this vantage point, the view emoted a mystical presence. The mountains, laid below, ruffled like a wrinkled bed cover and created zagged regions of valleys. He followed a trail, through the shadowy alpines, and down the hill. All around, the tree stems were strong and wide, tall and reaching far into the heavens. The fallen leaves formed a carpet beneath his boots. They crunched as he walked.

“Damn, Christian. We were supposed to grow old together,” he mumbled to the trees, as if his cousin’s soul lurked behind a thick stem.

Ironically, Christian was the most cautious person he knew, always warning them to “watch out, out here. A nigga gotta literally hide from these streets.” And hide he did. That boy must’ve spent a third of his high school years in the library. If you needed to speak to Christian, you knew where to find him: back corner of the library in front of the sad collection of “black literature.”

“Double curriculum” he called it. First was the one the school crammed down your throat. That Eurocentric narrative that purports that Europeans started everything and conquered all. The bogus “facts” you regurgitate back to them on exams to earn a degree for that job.

Then there’s the real narrative in which you discover that despite what the “textbook” says, Egyptians weren’t white and astrology, philosophy, and the sciences attributed to the Greeks were really started by blacks thousands of years before whites descended out of the Caucus Mountains.

“So while you write Pythagoras and Aristotle as the fathers of philosophy, you pretend to not know about Ptahhotep or Imhotep, or that they themselves openly admit to learning at the feet of black men.” His cousin would go on like this for hours, proclaiming the truth like John the Baptist by the Jordan River. And that’s when he was sober. Put some weed in Christian, and it was ten times worse: his why-do-they-hate-us speech and what-have-we-ever-done-to-them speech would always start with sporadic comments between puffs and coughs. Then, as the weed kicked in, he’d kick into high gear: “they’ve been hating on us since *before* the Christian era when the Hyksos then the Assyrian encroached into Egypt. So we migrate south and let them have the damn place?” Martin would ask, “We?” because he knew that would irk him. “Who? Nigga, we black folks. Anyway, then again in the fifteenth century, when we had one of the most established regions in Mali, Songhai, and Ghana. And here they come again, doing us so bad with that slavery shit. Did you know that they threw so many black people overboard that the sharks in the Atlantic Ocean altered their yearly migratory route, following the free food of black bodies? Man, somebody take this blunt before I start singing negro spirituals in this bitch.”

Martin chuckled at the memory, just as he discovered a stream through the thick trees. He sat on a rock by the water and began to think of Christian, police brutality, and the black man’s reality in this country, a place publicized as the “land of the free” and never adding “unless you’re black then no rapid movements, nigger.”

The sound of crunching leaves pulled him out of his reverie, and a white man with long hair and a beard wore sandals and a tie-dyed shirt. A chain of black rope and sea shells rested atop his bright, multi-colored shirt. His frame was skinny but tall. As if feeling Martin’s presence, the man slowly turned toward him and acknowledge him with a nodd. Navigating toward the rock, the man said, “What’s up, bro? Didn’t expect anybody else here.” Martin simply nodded. The feeling was mutual, but he felt his solitude encroached.

Methodically, he dug a pouch out from his pocket then pulled out a joint. After inspecting it, he took a lighter out and sparked it. “Yeah, bro. I absolutely love this spot. Smoke?” he asked as he extended the joint toward Martin.

Silently, Martin accepted the gift and inhaled it a few times. “Yeah, bro. This is my meditation spot. There are mystical powers in the mountains.” After retrieving the joint and taking a massive hit, he resumed, “Yeah, dude. All the prophets, Moses, Elijah, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, knew about the power of the mountains. The Bhagavad Gita, even, expounds on it as one of the prerequisites to attaining enlightenment.” He passed the joint, but this time, he reached into his pouch for a second joint to light up. “Yeah, bro. The ancient knowledge of the Gods is around us.” He looked around, as if trailing the knowledge with his eyes. “Know what I mean, bro?

“Sure,” Martin responded as the weed slowly eased his apprehension.

“Yeah, bro. They all received their divine orders in the mountains which call out to the chosen. Awesome.”

He said nothing for a while as they both listened to nature’s voice, whispering all around them. “Well, brother. I’m going to continue my walk. It was very nice to meet ya, and don’t forget:

bring about the change you want.” Martin accepted the extended hand.

“Alright. God bless,” Martin said as the strange man continued along the stream. With renewed vigor, Martin hopped off the rock, ready to traverse the large mountains and be on his way.
