**“Flowers” by Nick Evangelista**

Flowers flowers flowers flowers. Well there’s four words about flowers. I gotta tell you, this prompt had me- and still has me- stumped. I knew I would have trouble with this one the minute I saw it on the board two weeks ago. Sorry, guess I’m just not a flower guy. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not an enemy of the Geranium, a Hibiscus hater, nor could I ever be accused of slighting a Sunflower. In fact one of my favorite photos each year is the obligatory Tour de France Peloton racing through the Field of Sunflowers. Despite learning about the stamen in biology, I guess I just don’t get the bloomin’ craze about them.

Some of us toyed with writing about how one never sees flowers in a prison yard. If I had been more punctual with this paper that would have been true. However, this week, the yard is full of them! Here, there, everywhere! It’s a veritable Garden Show right next to the razor wire! An inmate I know who works in horticulture probably planted them. Hope he doesn’t read my essay. He’ll likely think of me as a protagonist of Petunia.

I was thinking of writing about an inmate who has the last name starting with an F. No, not that F word, Flowers, silly, Flowers. But, frankly, I probably know more about Tulips than I do about him. I know nothing of Tulips, as you might imagine.

So... what to write about flowers. I mean, as I said, I’ve no labile hostility to the Hosta. I guess I would miss them if they were suddenly gone. They do smell good, some of them. But, I only know that because others have shoved them under my nose. I’ve never ever started a day out with a fully self-supported snap-dragon-sniffing field trip

Right then, flowers…

I just can’t conjure a single thought about the Carnation. So, I guess I will close, like a fading rose.

Flowers…. Nope, I’ve got nothing.
