When I was growing up in the early 2000s, it was a wonderful time. The air in Tampa Bay was so full of promise. I was thirteen around this time. You could have a decent conversation with anyone. No one really had cell phones or PDAs. The only thing I had a little black electronic organizer. I had a Super Nintendo. Things were awesome. My PC was a Windows 1995. I used it to play Asteroids and Red Alert games. Things were great. I was living in an upper-middle class white suburban neighborhood. Race, what was that? Culture, what was that? My Christian/Catholic Orthodox/Fundamentalists lived in their own fantasy. I did not realize the struggle around me. Even though I know now I’m part Cherokee and some other stuff at the time I was just ignorant.

After 2001 I remember all hell broke loose on the streets. Cops and mayors wanted residents and children to stay inside. Regular traffic stops martial law was being slowly integrated into my life and I was oblivious somewhat to this new militarized police state. But everything was okay. It’s only now do I see a more complete picture of our ethical, moral, and sexual de-evolution degradation. But it’s all good. Everyone was freer in mind, body, spirit before these so-called terror attacks. Fear pervades, rapes, murders envelope the interstates, highways, byways and inner cityscapes. Hell, as an adult I would be afraid to hitchhike.

When I was fifteen I could get to New York in a few weeks and come back. People down south and everywhere just can’t trust each other. It’s up to the individual to start that friendship, make that trust. Even then I wouldn’t recommend it. Prison has taught me ninety percent of people who come up to you want something - sex, food, money, drugs. Most people operate with their lower three primeval chakras and get stuck there. The veil has been removed now, I can’t see it all coming. But I know every superpower has its fall. The U.S. is the first nation in our short history that used atomic weapons on human civilization. Who is the real terrorist?
