**“Lady in the Black Veil” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

Her eyes peered through the black veil.

There was pain in those eyes for all to tell.

Yet in mourning she was alone.

Here feelings were well known.

She spoke not a word, but there was that empty gaze.

For these were her darkest days.

Things would have changed if she had but one wish granted to her.

There was sadness in her heart, and there was no cure.

Yet, she stood proud and she stood tall;

This is what she wore to my wedding, for she’s my mother-in-law.
