**"Woman in Black" by Daniel Alvarez**

To me, this picture represents a society that oppresses women. I am a man, yet I feel bad that there are people that are allowed to act like this. Sometimes I feel sad for what is happening in the middle east, yet when I think about how they oppress women, I feel they get what they deserve. I know it’s a sad situation, yet why is the man in this picture not wearing a shirt. And the woman is covered from head to toe. In these societies, women do not talk to men. Men walk in front of women. I don’t fully understand what happened in the world that allowed this to happen to women, yet it is wrong. A girl named Malala just wanted to go to school. SO what did they do to her? They (men) shoot her in the head. I just can’t believe how women are treated in the Middle East. And I don’t feel it ever going to change. The Middle East has had wars going on since as long as I lived, and they have been at war since before I was born. For a society that oppresses women, I feel they’re getting what they deserve. Karma has a way of unfolding up onto those who deserve what they work for. These men want to bully women, so life is bullying them. Yet the women are still losing at the end of this story. Women in the Middle East will never know equality, and that’s a shame. Because in that a victim is created. These men need to change their ways. I know what it is that they believe, that has them act this way. Yet I can't mention it. And I have the freedom of speech here in America. Either way, it’s sad to see men act this way, and women to be oppressed in such a way. Somethings will never change. And I feel bad about the situations in the Middle East. What some of those people are going through, no human should have to go through. It’s literally a heartbreaking situation. Yet SOMETHINGS WILL NEVER CHANGE.
