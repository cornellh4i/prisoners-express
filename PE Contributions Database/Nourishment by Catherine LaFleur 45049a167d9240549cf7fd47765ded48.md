**Nourishment by Catherine LaFleur**

My life is a little difficult. At camp Prisoney Land, there are a limited number of law clerks. Currently there are two, myself and Laurelei. Optimum operations would have four but one got frustrated, another ill, three more tired of the management. 2019 was a brutal year. I felt like I was on the Titanic bailing water with a Dixie cup. Especially the part where I was by myself.

I have learned that I have to nourish myself, no one is ever going to say, hey you are working too hard. Catherine you deserve to take a day off, you should rest. Indeed, I do know how whiney this sounds in the face of what other prisoners are going through because I read your work cover to cover every anthology.

In truth, I have a deep well inside of myself, like that goddess with the kettle containing an unending supply of nourishment. However, no matter what people tell me, I know I am no goddess. Just a normal human being. My job requires me to have ethics. I can’t pass by someone lying on the road or turn away the lion with a thorn in its paw. This is why people feel they can approach me with questions at all hours of the day or night. The underlying problem here is fear. Either the person is afraid something terrible has happened, is happening, or will happen. Usually there is no immediate answer. I give an empathetic smile and tell them to drop a request to their law clerk. I don’t think these people really expect an answer, they just want to be heard… at 6 AM in the morning. Sigh.

This can be a real energy suck. If I don’t do things to nourish myself, my well will get drained and I won’t make it. Here are a few things I do for myself. Twice a week I treat myself to a spa day. Instead of using the normal boring routine shower soap, I get out my blackberry sugar body scrub and wash my whole self including my hair. This stuff smells straight up like the most fabulous fruit pie ever baked. When I use it the aroma lingers all over my sheets, in my cell, it wafts everywhere I go. I got lucky at the holiday hygiene give away at the chapel. It is a jumbo bottle and I will be sugar and fruit scented for awhile. I love love love being a girl.

I read books. Lots and lots of them. Although I do read trashy paranormal novels and I am currently hooked on the non-trashy fantasy novelist Joe Abercrombie, I also extensively read poetry, history, and science fiction. I consume the New Yorker magazine and the New York Times Sunday paper every week and do the crossword puzzles in ink. Those of you who do it in pencil obviously have commitment problems or are cowards. Bring it y’all.

I write and not only for PE. Sometimes other people enjoy my writing. I was flabbergasted back in 2017 to win a PEN America Award… get this… in poetry. Never have I considered myself a serious poet. Poetry is more like a decadent piece of Turkish Delight, something to reward myself. The community of writers at PE and Exchange for Change feed me in ways too complex to express. You keep me reading and keep me interested in your lives and stories.

I have to engage in my personal spiritual practice with daily readings, prayer, meditation, yoga, and mindfulness. Everyday I try to wring out my arrogance, anger, and apathy and push good intention into the world. I can’t fix people, not even myself, so I walk around singing Ho’pono’pono. I’m sorry, please forgive me, I thank you and I love you. Even when I can’t do anything at all, at least I can do that to help nourish myself and the world.

My thanks and admiration to the following: Nate Lindell, that France story was for you, to Bobby Bunderson, loved the astronomy and the life chart, to Conceta Quijas what a great dad story I loved it, Derek is MIA, and finally Walter Hart’s fabulous piece, I have read it four times and passed it around Camp Prisoney Land.
