**Thankful by Jeremy Brown** 

I am thankful for everyone at Prisoner Express for allowing us to have a voice. We who are behind enemy lines experiencing the suffering and trauma, so others who haven’t can not only be made aware but not have to go through it. This is an opportunity for all of us so we can be made to realize our own transgressions of being greedy, lustful, thieving, and all those things we all have done to each other but were not caught for it. Thus thankfulness is really me coming to a decisive conclusion of acceptance of where I am. I am the only one in my family to become imprisoned. My little brothers and sisters, 4 total, have now completely changes, all due to my incarceration. All my brothers and sisters now have jobs going to school and have stopped getting in trouble. This I am truly thankful for. I see disabled inmates everyday who’d try to help in various tasks. So I am thankful I am able to be healthy to help teach yoga to some of these disabled men. Last of all I am grateful to my Ancestor Spirit Guides who have protected me from the evil demonic energies in other people, who have tried and failed to kill me through poisoning, knives, and gang bangers. Thus proving that my native heritage is real, and my father was speaking truth to me as a boy when describing my Ancestor Guides; I will leave it at that as I digress.
