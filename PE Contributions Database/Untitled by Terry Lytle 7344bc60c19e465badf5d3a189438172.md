**Untitled by Terry Lytle**

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to bring me down…

No choruses, no catchphrases

Two-fifteen, Black-thoughts fillin’ pages

Tariq Trotter, upholding the discipline and the dream

I don’t pack verses

Never sacrifice the team…

An army of I-frienemies I don’t tolerate

Who can master, “Cowboy” the Great?

Upside down, on my Zeppelin trip!

While, minds and hearts… are full of hate

Junkie-assault on bodies

Buried-alive, addicted to misery and strife

What do I care? Where their sense of ambitions and politics is… Tampons,

And weak-minded jock-boys

Kinda like a Chili Peppers cover, where men are wearing cock-toys

Something like, sock joy… Prisoner’s in a riot

Miss me with the fan fare

I don’t sell out, that easy

And while you’re 2-facing me, remember

How everybody else’s fingers was greasy

With hearts like, chicken tenders

I’m still not eatin’ chicken

Or sleazy

Life of hard spots, patiently waiting to taste, K-Breezy…

With an army like I got

My mind makes gravity easy

One diploma, in each hand

All those frenemies beneath me…

So…

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to bring me down…

Pretty horse, major chords and a loping beat

Best mechanisms

Precisely placed for the street

This is my anthem - as wild as the mercury sounds

Temperature’s rising; no, I don’t back down

I’m on the way to the clouds… Ancestral, burying mound

White Zeppelin and a dark horse… Such a , deeply embattled romance

Softly searching for small signs

Gently thinking: What’s left

This is, just

A few syllables - a marking of the time for the state of mind that I’m in…

Most have, loose screws… Rattlin’ like a spaghetti strainer

I gotta get a new crew

They’re, all scrambled (like fried eggs)

I got

Production on a two-fifteen

Planned-platinum

Your girl’s mouth, is my studio

I’m comin’ on the track

I told you, don’t bust shots

This, my balloon!

I bust back…

So…

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to bring me down…

Ta-Ban, a-wake

Taliban, none ain’t!

Don’t want this isolation but what’s a King to do?

I got the game, checkmated

Your, sabotage? - it’s outdated:

You’re something like a Beastie Boy, hanging around Paul’s Boutique…

As, all the ladies screaming - “Huh! - Cowboy! - Look up there!”

Letting y’all know

Get a new lease

Slay ire-fiends while I sleep

With a, brief inquiry into on-line relations: Is that the phone you’re fuckin’, or Selfie faces?

Because to a Don like me, it’s just rearranged places

Something like prison - a bunch of mental-health cases

Another time…

Another place…

Another life… Another case

So…

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Why you tryin’ to… bring me, down...
