**“Flowers” by Stephen Lee Birchfield, Jr.**

“Flowers? What an utterly banal suggestion. You may as well give her your fingernail clippings” berated the officious Majordomo.

“Sir, it is all I can afford to offer the Queen of Diamonds,” said the urchin, recently scrubbed. “Besides I don’t have any fingernails, y’all cut ‘em all off” he ventured further.

“Look you little turd, sit right there in this foyer closet until I return with your instructions.” The Majordomo brooked no lip whatsoever from those below his status. Which was very high indeed. The urchin sat bewildered in the foyer closet listening to the click of the Majordomo’s heels reverberate down the castle’s long shadowed hall.

The kid was not given to introspection. He simply instinctive in action did things. Things that generally ended in fiasco, and chagrin to those around him. When the servants of darkness struck the carriage containing the Queen, the ragamuffin- without cognition- found himself on the top of the conveyance shooting butterscotch candies at villains with his stolen wrist rocket. The butterscotch candies were stolen as well. The hero of this story developed a case of sticky fingers at an early age.

A cave in of the queen’s autonomous carriage was why the urchin found himself in a Rubenesque lap staring into very startled blue eyes. Kid was out of ammunition and the bad guys were on the move. Our less than hygienical hero started stealing the Queen of Diamond’s diamonds from right off her plump fingers. There were 4 whelped up bad guys. After the dead eye dick with a wrist rocket began propelling diamonds there were 4 dead bad guys strewn about the carriage with holes in their throat.

The homeless urchin found himself full of acclaim and applause for rescuing the queen from certain death. All the queen’s diamonds were recovered except one. The diamonds were dug from the cadavers of evil men getting their just reward. However, the one unrecovered was the most important, the kingdom’s heirloom. Whoever held this diamond was controller, autocrat, king, queen, sole ruler of a nation.

Of course this shady urchin stole the diamond. To him it was nothing but a big shiny rock. A certain queen wanted her right to reign back, and would stop at nothing to get her just. It was all planned out in a meticulous manner. Urchin was pretty much kidnapped, groomed to the extreme, run through the body scanners time and again, and about to be tortured. The good queen quavered at this excessive display, and thought to persuade the child to reveal the whereabouts of the kingdom’s diamond.

There was a knock on the queen’s chamber and her majordomo entered, as grumpy as ever. Telling the queen her guest had arrived.

“Your majesty, to beseech thee to permit your servant to lop the boy’s head off” pleaded the Majordomo. She looked nonplussed at this statement. She was never one for violence, to the complete aggravation of her officers.

“Oooo Tippleworth you have my diamond?”

“Not as yet your highness.”

“Idiot, why do you want to execute my little savior then?” The good queen huffed. “Go get the child and bring him in please.” Tippleworth bowed, and clicked back towards the foyer closet and found the urchin- remarkably- where he left him. The kid had shown an amazing aptitude to disobey even the smallest order.

“Boy, the queen wishes to see you, and I admonish you to be on your best behavior. In fact, it may be best for you to place your hands in your pocket,” Tippleworth patiently explained.

“Well what about my flowers I picked ‘em special for her,” our hero whined.

“You scapulous curr, you picked those flowers right out of the royal flower beds, oh, alright, carry them yourself.”

“Thank you sir,” and off the urchin and Majordomo went.

Upon entering the Queen’s private chambers the urchin did not stop or bow, but walked right up to the Queen of Diamonds and thrusted the flowers at her.

“Well, what have we here?” The Queen beamed, pretending not to notice where the flowers came from.

“You saved my life and all gratitude is warranted, but you have something that belongs to me, you took it right off the royal finger! Now hand it over please, sir.” The hard look in the usually benevolent eyes of the queen made the urchin realize that he was in the presence of a queen indeed.

With bowed heads, the raggamuffins quivered: “The diamond is in the flowers, your majesty, right in the middle of ‘em.” The queen looked and it was there glowing as she had never seen it glow. Mesmerized and transfixed, the queen had a vision, and knew she must marry her daughter to this street urchin before her. Her grandson would begin the 1000 year reign.
