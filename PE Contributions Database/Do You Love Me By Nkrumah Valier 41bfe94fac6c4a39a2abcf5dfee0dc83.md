***Do You Love Me?* By Nkrumah Valier**

Hello Doris. I just want you to know that I am thinking of you. And that I love you.

I was doing some soul searching looking for the right words to reach out to you. Please come in out of the rain so that we can talk. Can I ask you something?

Do you love me? Do you want me? Do you need me? Don’t you ever leave me. Cause I love you. I want you, and I need you. So I will never leave you.

Yes, I need you baby. Please don’t walk out on me. Or I will go crazy. Because I love you, and I wouldn’t know what to do without you. When you are with me, I feel so complete. Your pretty brown eyes keep me hypnotize. You are so beautiful I can’t keep my eyes off you. That’s why I get so jealous every time another man looks at you. Every time your phone rings, I wonder if it could be him. I know that you say that I am trippin’, always accusing you of cheating on me. And you keep telling me that you are not. It just stays on my mind that you have once before and how it turned out. That secret we share what we did together 1 year ago today. Something we both must live with for the rest of our lives. I know I said that I forgave you and promised you that I would never bring it up again. But how can we forget?

Everytime I look at Ebony, I see his face. She calls me father, and you and I both know that I am not her father. Why wouldn’t you tell me that you were pregnant before we did what we did that night, and that you weren’t sure who made you pregnant? You made me believe that she was my daughter: I love her, and it broke my heart to find out that she is not mine. It felt like you betrayed me again, but this time, it felt like you ripped my heart out of my chest with your hand. Had I known that you were pregnant with his child, my actions would’ve been different. You would be where he is at now! Don’t walk away from me when I am talking to you, bitch! I’m sorry Doris, I didn’t mean to call you that. Please stop crying baby. Come here, I just want to hold you in my arms. It’s been 3 months since we last touched each other. As much as it hurts, I do still love you.

You can never take back what happened: a life was created, and we can never forget what we did. Everytime we look at her, we see his face. Even my family knows that she is not my child. Why do you think my mother never asked to spend time with Ebony? Everyone knows Doris: it’s no secret. They said something to me about it; they just have not said anything to you about it. How could you have unprotected sex with him knowing that you could get pregnant or risk bringing something home to me? Do you hate me that much, Doris?

No Nkrumah! You don’t understand; it’s not what you think. I do love you, you are my king. After I realized the mistake I was making, I went to his house to end the relationship with him because I love you. He pulled a gun on me then made me undress. He raped me telling me that he would kill me if I did not do exactly what he said, then he said that he would drive to our house and kill you and Alton too. I begged him to put on a condom, and he could do whatever he wanted to do to me. He told me that he would make sure you found out about us because he was going to get me pregnant with his child. And he recorded the rape and promised to send you a copy. I cried the entire time he raped me. He let me get up around 4:30 pm and clean myself up and told me that if I called the police and report it, he would kill us before they catch him. You have no idea how I felt inside not knowing if it was his baby or yours. I am so sorry, Nkrumah--please forgive me. I went to Planned Parenthood to get an abortion, but I thought, what if the baby was yours? I couldn’t kill our baby. How I prayed that Ebony was yours, but when I saw her face after she was born, I knew she was his child. My heart just wanted to stop beating. I went back to his house to find them, but I could not find the copy he said he would make. Please don’t hate me, Nkrumah.

Please stop crying, Doris. I don’t hate you. I’m sorry what happened to you. I wish you had told me so that I could understand.

It’s 3 am in the morning, who in the hell could be knocking on our door at this time in the morning? Who is it!

It’s Detective Garrison from the Houston Police Department Homicide Division. I am looking for Doris to ask her a few questions about someone she dated.

I turned around and made eye contact with Doris, and she pulled her 9mm out of her Chanel hand bag. She told me that she does love me, then told me to open the door and let him in. I told Doris that I love her too and grabbed my 9mm then reached for the door knob.
