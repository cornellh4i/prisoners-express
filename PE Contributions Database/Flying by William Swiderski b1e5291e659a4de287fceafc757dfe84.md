**Flying by William Swiderski**

I remember flying for the first time. It was shortly after a major plane crash and I was terrified. But I needed to get somewhere quickly. So I had to fly. Once airborne and after a few drinks :), I just got lost in my thoughts and problems and everyday life.

Things weren’t going too good for me at the time and I faced many difficulties. But just looking down below where everything looked so small. I felt something, and somehow things turned around for me and my problems didn’t seem so big anymore and life went on.

I try to think like that now that after 35 years locked up and 26 to go that there are many in worse positions than mine and they see my time as small and my problems as nothing compared to theirs. And life goes on in our small little world.
