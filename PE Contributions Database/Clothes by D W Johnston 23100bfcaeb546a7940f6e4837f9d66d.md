**Clothes by D.W. Johnston**

They say black is a slimming color. But I assure you, you put on these Texas white and you’ll be a skinny sumbitch real quick!

I don’t know what I’m going to do when I get released and it’s no longer okay for me to walk around with syrup/mustard/beans etc on my shirt. Maybe when I have time to eat and not just shovel, shovel, shovel I’ll be a bit more careful. Or I’ll just coordinate my shirts with my food. Or maybe I’ll be too old to give a damn.

I know one thing for sure, I’m never buying any white clothing again. Ever!
