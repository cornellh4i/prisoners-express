**Rescued by Joseph Lightsey**

What a nice picture of a mother and child embraced in a hug, a very obvious deep bond forged through lots of love and trust. I think a typical person who was raised in a good home and good parents would see this as a very normal picture. Unfortunately, most inmates look at this picture with confusion - trying to affirm that this is how a mother is supposed to treat their son. You see, most of us inmates did not have a loving and trusting relationship with our mother. What we got was a mentally unstable mother who was unfit to be a parent. Instead of stability, they were violent and abusive in nature. Yelling, screaming is what we saw. My mother used to lock me outside the house for hours at a time, in a very rough neighborhood - I was only 5 years old! Once when doing this, I encountered a 13 year old bully who - for no reason - punched me in my nose 3 times while declaring “I have three things to teach you today!” I ran home hoping to get assistance from mom - only to sit on the porch for an hour before she came out rushing past me. She said she didn’t have time to deal with me because she had a date. I watched her leave feeling there was no way I could ever trust this person. This one example is just the tip of the iceberg of the shit I went through - although from hearing the stories from other inmates; my bringing up seems to have not been so bad.
