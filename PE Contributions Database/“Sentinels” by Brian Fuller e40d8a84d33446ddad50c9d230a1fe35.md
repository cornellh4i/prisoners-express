**“Sentinels” by Brian Fuller**

When the first Sentinels appeared overhead, people were shocked to say the least. There was widespread panic about government surveillance and invasion of privacy. Nobody knew for sure just how sophisticated those communication and imaging systems were. The media wasn’t helping matters either. With folks talking about weaponization and martial law, a certain amount of paranoia was understandable.

After all, they had been covertly developed as a joint venture between defense contractors and private industry. Necessity may be the mother of invention, but it’s a downright shame that it took a sash of wildfires and hurricanes for the powers that be, to finally release to the public what they’d worked on in secret for all those years. A perfect hybrid of old world and new age technologies; these “drone-dirigibles” sort of had everybody scratching their heads, saying “why didn’t they do this sooner.” They were a natural blend of efficiency and versatility.

The earliest prototypes tested by the military were many simple unarmed aerial vehicles which closely resembled the famous “GOODYEAR or FUJI” blimps seen over football games. However, it didn’t take long before an exponential paradigm shift in both design and manufacturing technology started producing behemoths that rivaled the size of the legendary “Gnoff Zeppelin” from a century ago. It wasn’t simply the dimensions of the thing that had people scared. Their futuristic look reminded folks of the huge airships from movies like “AVATAR.” There were even a few misinformed unfortunate souls who swore they were alien spacecraft.

Limited orders were paced by the coast guard, forest service, and F.E.M.A. It didn’t take long for everybody to notice the proactive approach to problem solving was saving countless lives. If an ounce of prevention is truly worth a pound of care, then these vessels were certainly paying off in spades. The common sense mindset of already having disaster relief and emergency management systems in place before a catastrophe, is something we’ve needed for a very long time.

Now, instead of wildfires exploding in size threatening lives and property, they can be dealt with before they get out of hand. With extended deployments enabling them to be positioned over high risk zones ahead of time, response times are dramatically reduced. Traditional aircraft are limited in both accuracy and capacity for extinguishing fires. A Sentinel can approach an area slowly at low attitude using camera guided water cannons and flame retardant. Thermal imaging allows them to view areas obscured by smoke.

Their performance as a humanitarian relief platform proved itself to be indispensable in the aftermath of hurricane Xavier. Ejection pod systems dropped food, water, medicine and every other imaginable necessity. When speakers instructed the being lowered by winch cable, people actually thought there was a pilot on board giving instructions. Once they found themselves safely inside the aircraft, a video cam-link system allowed them to speak with controllers. This interaction with those being rescued provided valuable intelligence in real time about those still trapped in devastated areas.

Information is interfaced through an amazing network of advanced systems. Satellite impute, ground controller, and artificial intelligence are integrated to assure the highest level of performance. Each Sentinel has the capacity to function autonomously, as well as come together en masse to cover complex problems over large areas. Homeland Security and local law enforcement groups alike have repeated having success stories in threatening terrorist attacks and all manner of criminal endeavours.

Tragedy was narrowly averted when a senator's daughter was found deep in the woods at night. The Sentinels forward looking infa-red sensors were able to spot her and her kidnapper and track them until law enforcement could intercept them. Still another instance was when a congressman himself was pulled from frigid waters after his boat capsized in a storm.

It’s sad that it takes these near misses happening to our aristocratic elite before they’re willing to lobby lawmakers for change. Everybody has known for a long time that the lives of the general public take a back seat to special interest dollars filling politicians’ pockets. Social justice, public safety, and human rights are nice catch phrases during the election campaigns. But once they’re in office they’re blinded by the corruption of power and manipulation and deception become business as usual.
