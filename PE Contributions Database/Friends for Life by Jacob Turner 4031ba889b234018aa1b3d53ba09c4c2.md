**Friends for Life by Jacob Turner**

They all probably thought we were fall-down drunk; two blocks beyond blitzed and headed for blackout with no GPS to guide the way. But life quickly teaches any curiosity monger that perception and reality are not the inseparable bedfellows we subconsciously assume them to be. Sure, we imbibed at every raucous uptown watering hole we wandered into, but it wasn’t the alcohol that had us rolling and roiling the translucent summer air.

We’ve known each other since we were ten. Well, to be precise, Jared could only claim nine and some change when Bob and I let him tag along to the “treasure cove.” Our treasure: a few tattered pages out of some cheap knock-off porno mag we had stolen from the tool shed of Bob’s crazy stepdad (who knows what he was doing with it out there). The first time Jared glimpsed a bare breast, he started tearing up. We called him a sissy and gut-punched him so he’d have something to cry about. Looking back on it now, maybe he had some innate sort of wisdom, like he knew at that moment, his innocence had been siphoned off and would never return.

Fifteen years later, we’re having the time of our lives - maybe the last “time” of our lives. Tonight, we drank in life as best as we could. The good part of life - you know, the side of the life-coin where Jared doesn’t have Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. All the specialists assured him, “This is a highly treatable form of cancer. You’ll be fine.” Their words are now like water in the hand - fleeting and nothing more than anger-provoking platitudes as time creeps closer to his unavoidable appointment with a desiccated spot of dirt just beyond the comforting shade of a ninety-five year old oak. Tonight, the coin landed on the good side where BOb’s bag isn’t packed for another deployment to that God-forsaken wasteland where kids don’t have their innocence stolen by lewd pics but by whack job radicals who promise that a backpack full of homemade kaboom will get the whole fam a free ride to the all-inclusive Elysian resort.

Then there’s me. Everything always seems to go my way. Life is shitty like that. My best friends, they’ll both be dead in six months. Me, I get all the breaks and haven’t earned a damn one. They’ll be dead and I’ll cope with a few months of survivor’s guilt - typical reaction for a self-righteous asshole like me. I’ll live on and walk the same streets. Only I’ll be drowning my sorrows, night after night in a spiral of self-deprecation I think serves as some penance for the burdensome privilege of being able to open my eyes every morning while they sleep in overpriced boxes.

But none of that matters tonight. Tonight, the coin landed on heads. And we drink life, with no worries, no burdens, no cancer, no deployment, no depression, no regret - just the indelible and ineffable high of life.
