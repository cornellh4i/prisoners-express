**“Face to Face” by David Irons**

****From day one, fear has dared me to deal with it. However, I am not sure that I have met the challenge well. When I was 6, my parents went out for the evening, and my siblings and I were left in the care of a babysitter. All I remember of that day is that after we had all been put to bed, having only been asleep about an hour or so, my brother came to wake me up He informed me that the house was on fire and that it wasn’t far from my room. So we both ran upstairs to tell the babysitter.

She instructed my brother to go back downstairs and try to put out the fire because it was still rather small. So he followed her instructions while the babysitter went to wake my sisters up in case we needed to evacuate. Not long after my brother went to put the fire out, he came running back upstairs to tell us that the fire was too big. We didn’t hesitate. The babysitter knew to get us to the neighbor’s house so she could call the fire department.

At that time of night, it seemed like an eternity for the fire department to show up. When they finally arrived, they were accompanied by police. While the fire department focused on putting the fire out, police officers came over to question us. They started with the babysitter. From there, they continued through everyone else present in the house, and my turn was last. I told the officers that my brother had come to wake me up because there was a fire in the house. They didn’t believe me. One of my officers took out his handcuffs and told my mom to put them on me. So I told the officer that I was scared of my Kenny Rogers poster, and so I burned it. At that, I was given a reminder of the dangers of playing with fire. I consider that moment one of my many losses to fear over the years.

Fear has proven to be a formidable foe as well as a faithful friend. As a foe, it paralyzes me from doing what I know to be right. In a friendly way, fear has warned me of danger and sometimes compelled me to do what is right. Thus, the challenge in facing fear has been discerning whether it approaches as friend or foe.
