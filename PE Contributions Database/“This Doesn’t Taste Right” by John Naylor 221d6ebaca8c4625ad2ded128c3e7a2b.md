**“This Doesn’t Taste Right” by John Naylor**

My first thought when I saw this writing assignment was when life gives you shit, make shitcastles! Well that could only be about number two or it’s terrible. It only goes south from there. Besides, some of you reading this might be on your medicine. Personally, “taking the kids to the pool” may be unsettling in that state. I never thought fingers went with that activity. Not well anyway. Snoop doesn’t like to brush his teeth in that state. OK, so we are different. Different is ok.

As long as it isn’t something you paid for, in that case “when life gives you rock salt, make ice cream.” ideally that would be great. Well, not a lot of guys make ice cream in this prison. But you can do it with the table salt on commissary, or a lot of saved packets and ice in your cooler. Granted, you won’t want to drink that water in your hot pot afterward. What else is obvious? Cocoa, cappuccino mix, milk, melted marshmallows go great in it. You get the idea. Plastic baggies with zipper tops hold it while it freezes in the bags. The bags you have from Kairos cookies, volunteers, and donations. Thanks guys. And lady chefs, we love ya! It’s a recipe. A method. Life doesn’t have to be so impossible.

Life doesn’t have to have an impossible formula. You don’t have to be uncomfortable and miserable as possible. Pet a dog or something sometimes. Or something else that’s alive and can’t move very fast. Just kidding. Remember they’re very sober. And there’s rules. So when life gives you rock salt, make ice cream. It sells fast, by the way. I’m just saying, especially if you have some grilled cheese to go with it.
