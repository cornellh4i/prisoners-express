**Sisters by Richard Atkins**

By the time the average man wakes up to reality, the woman will be working another planet. I’ve met men who believe that all men are superior to all women. I totally disagree with that assumption. There’s superior men and women who are just as superior

Take Oprah, for instance. She’s strong, beautiful, determined to succeed and sort of a mastermind. She’s been on her grind for like thirty years and she’s still strong with the world at her beck and call.

Women hear Oprah make a statement about anything and their all-ears, ready to jump at the advice or opinion she has to share. That’s just as powerful as the words of the president of the free world…

These are our mothers, grandmothers, female cousins, aunts and most of all, sisters…

These are the sisters I love, cherish, adore and forgive for their sins. Because our sisters are the finest times of each era. It’s like every revolution. There has to be a war. There has to be agony.

Our brains cannot comprehend the justice, the strength of women. The superiority of the woman species. Our sisters become mothers, aunts, grandmothers etc. so we love them, care for them and are there to protect them but instead, we are amongst weak men who has chosen to hurt and murder our women!

This action taken by these weak men in our societies are blasphemy.

It’s like a disciple becoming one of Jesus’s rivals. That’s a lost cause.

Our sisters become, because they are born to be queens. Born to give birth to our future nation now and for eternity.

I see the burning in me and the fire is so hot and humid, I breathe fire. Fire throughout my words from the unheard and the people that deserve.

Our sisters are our sisters because our sisters was born to be the sisters of this world and we shouldn’t need #METOO movement to know that our hurting the female species is inequality, a great injustice.

Therefore, I promise you, I love all my sisters…

Sincerely,

Richard Atkins Jr.
