****Overcoming all obstacles against all odds is what comes to mind when viewing this picture prompt. It is a reminder of how far the United States Criminal Justice Systems’ Extraordinary Rendition will go to bring back anyone trying to escape justice.

Very few of the citizens of America have any idea that the American Federal Criminal Justice System will go to any length to bring back anyone from anywhere. They do it so frequently without even attempting to give the person, a U.S. citizen, any due process or right to extradition hearing. I have been brought back to California from New York in 1992 by the Parole Dept who told me of some of the places this extraordinary rendition agent had gone to bring back parole violators anywhere on earth.

The agent to whom I spoke was nice enough. I only had a few months left before discharge of parole in my first conviction (and only other time, ever in trouble). He and I were coming through O’Hare and had a long layover. We discussed politics and the state of criminal injustice in America. I was told of trips the California Parole Department had made to places like the Philippines to bring back abscond parolees. Most times, in foreign countries, they did not even wait for formal extradition. They just went in, grabbed up the person, and brought them back. Even when a person is not on parole or convicted of a crime, it is still the view of the Federal Government that i America wants to bring back one of its citizens to stand trial, it does so. They do not care about things like extradition treaties or the lack thereof.

This all began in earnest right after 9/11/01 but had been U.S. policy debate for decades. After 9/11, they could use the phrase “National Security Matter,” and that was all that was needed. It’s lip service now. THere is no Constitution; it’s only an illusion. That is, if investigative journalists really do the job needed for a free nation, then more light needs to be brought to bear on these types of actions…

That photo may appear to be a movie shot of make-believe to some. However, to me, it’s a reminder of how much goes on under the cover of darkness in our government. Freedom is a state of mind. There is no true freedom let. Question now is: was there ever true freedom, or was it all just an illusion?
