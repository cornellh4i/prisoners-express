**"Holidays" by Raymond Swanson**

Holidays are meant to be spent alone. At least, that’s what the general public feels about convicts and inmates. And I would say it’s probably the most depressing for many of us between Thanksgiving and New Years. Even with the “friends” made in here and the pen pals that the lucky ones have, it gets difficult not to fall into that lowly state. The fight becomes being able to recognize your thoughts and feelings before you get into the bottom of your spiral.

Certainly, some just wish to block it out completely. Some just stay in bed more to sleep the days away. I personally like to look back on some of the holidays I’ve had and the people I’ve shared the experience of living with that have been a part of my life.

I can remember waking up on Easter morning to search for a basket with a hollow chocolate rabbit, two or three Reese’s Eggs, and other goodies that my Easter Bunny mom hid. I remember the smell of freshly baked cookies resonating into my room early in the morning in preparation for a get-together.

I remember my maternal grandparents making their rounds to the family homes on Christmas morning to give their grandkids a $20 that we always looked forward to. I see myself sitting at the kid's table at age eight while the adults laugh and tell stories that I didn’t quite understand then while giving thanks for all they had and being able to all get together for one more year.

And then I fell in love and holidays took on a whole new meaning in my life. Meeting another family and being welcomed in and taking on a whole new sense of family brought fulfillment to my life. Her mom was a career cook and left nothing to be desired at mealtimes on holidays, or any meal, really.

And other than the great times we spent with each other’s families, we were content to sit at home together on New Year’s Eve and watch the ball drop in NYC on television. At the ages of twenty and twenty-one, we could have been partying or carrying on with friends, yet we just wanted to be together. Despite what’s happened in life, these are memories I wouldn’t trade for the world.

We’re all human beings, all with feelings and the ability to slip into that holiday spiral of depression. To you I say, keep your heads up my brothers and sisters behind bars or a forty-foot wall. Stay positive. We all have each other.
