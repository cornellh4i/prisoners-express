**“Helping Hand” by Joseph Alvin Parrish**

I guess that I told y’all that as of today My 31 2019 I have been granted an FI-2 by the Parole board Panel. Am I asking too much by asking for a helping hand? Will you rejoice with me? I’m looking to get out of this place with each and every day that passes I’m growing more and more. Impatient. I can hardly wait to get on that Blue-Bird (bus) enroute to wherever I’m going, I don’t know yet. I really don't have anywhere to go upon release that’s why I’m asking you-all for a helping hand. Well, you might be asking yourself what can I do to help my theme writing brothers? If so, please allow me to enlighten you. What can you do to offer me a helping hand? You can pray for me. Did you believe that there’s power in prayer? Do you believe in a power greater than yourself? When you need a helping hand, who do you look to?

Have you given up on life, and just thrown in the towel, saying what’s the use? I have a life sentence, I’ll never get out of this place, being on death-row is the end of the road for me. Have all of the five year set-offs bamboozled you? Have you lost all hope of ever being delivered from prison? If so, I would like to give you a helping hand. I will be praying for you to experience a positive-outcome. It does not matter who you are, or, of what you’ve done, or of how much time you have. I believe that God can give you a helping hand, and turn that hopeless situation around for you. It’s not as hopeless as it may seem.

What Satan means for evil

God can make it turn out for your good A helping hand is what I’m talking about.

Dear Cohort, do you have a bible? If so, can you literally turn with me to –

Jeremiah 32:17 Now read it. What does it say? Do you believe that?

Jeremiah 32:17 Ah my Lord God! You made the heavens, and the earth with your great power and your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for you. Do you believe that?

Jeremiah 32:27 I am the Lord the God of all the living. Is anything too difficult for me?

Isaiah 40:26-31 Go There! Lift up your eyes on high and see who created these. He leads out their army, and numbers then calling them, all by name. By his great might and the strength of his power not one of them is missing.

Why O Jacob do you say and declare, O Israel my way is hidden from the lord and my right is disregarded by my God

Do you not know? Have you not heard? The lord is God from old, creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary and his knowledge is beyond scrutiny.

He gives power to the faint, abundant strength to the weak.

Through young men faint and grow weary, and youths stagger and fall

They that hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar on eagle’s wings. They will run and not grow weary, walk and not grow faint. All of these scriptures.

That I have just shared with you speaks of someone greater than you who is willing to give you a helping hand but you cannot take his promises lightly because he is a God of truth.

Numbers 23:19 God is not a human being who speaks falsely, nor a mortal who feels regret. Is God one to speak and not act, to decree and not bring it to pass? I’m here to tell you that God will give you a helping hand. All it takes is efficacious prayer, and unconditional trust. That means trusting him when you don’t understand. God can see things in you that you can’t see in yourself. His plan for your life is bigger than you plan but God doesn’t take us in a straight line. Part of his plan involves twists, turns disappointments, losses and bad breaks

If you have conditional trust you’ll get discouraged and think why is this happening, but God is still directing your steps. Trust him even when it feels as though you’re going in the wrong direction. God has the final say. Right now he is working out his plan for you life. There may be some fiery furnaces. Are you going to trust him only if he delivers you from the fire. I believe with all of my from the fire. I believe with all of my heart that if you trust him he is faithful to give a helping hand. The longer I live the more I pray God let not my will but your will be done. Let God do it his way. God will not only give the desires of your heart he’ll do more than you ask of think it’s Jesus folks so your priority is.
