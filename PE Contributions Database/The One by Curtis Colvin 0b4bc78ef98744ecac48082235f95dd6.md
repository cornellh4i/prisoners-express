***The One* by Curtis Colvin**

I am the one who will hold back the water. The one who will cleanse your aura. I can call upon the winds to bless your journey. If you desire to know your future, step into the water with me. My guidance with the spirits will direct you to your soulmate. All it will cost is $29.99. Isnâ€™t that a small price to pay to hear from your deceased loved ones, or to learn the winning lottery numbers? By the way, we take all credit cards. No checks please.
