At 5 years old, my dad told me that I’ve had long curly hair since I was a baby. Looking in the mirror that day, I only saw wool and nappy hair. I used to watch my favorite wrestler, The Rock, in 1999. I was all smiles when my dad took me to get a haircut because I actually looked like The Rock with my fro, faded sides, and a part on the front left side.

In my elementary school, I stood out with a part in my afro, and so I was odd compared to other kids’ haircuts, though I didn’t feel it. Since my dad told me, “You’re handsome, and you will get all the girls,” I got a girl or two. My haircut complimented my men.

However, I had to move. My living conditions required DHS to put me in a foster home, and my guardian was Aunt Doobie who took my 3 foster brothers and me for haircuts every two weeks. Our barber Terry cut his hair from his room. From 2000 to 2005, Aunt Doobie contributed a lot of money in Terry’s pockets for cutting our hair at $10 each. Terry was so sharp that I could compare my fro with Steve Harvey’s fro.

2002: I grew my hair. A 70’s fro, braids, and twisties was my style. After a year of growth, Aunt Doobie asked me if I wanted a haircut, and because my foster brothers got haircuts, I did the same to blend in with the brotherly experience.

By the 7th grade, my grooming would pay off. Alexis Williams became my middle school sweetheart, and thanks to Terry, my haircut got her on the first day. I didn’t think she would like me due to my out of style fro, especially since our classmates followed the trend of low cuts with waves. By the middle of the school year, she eventually got tired of my standout look and asked me to cut it. She was overtly blushing when I took the initiative to do it for her, and while I was nervous of the new look, I got comfortable once I got the waves to spin like Jordan’s shot when the ball rolls around the rim and finally goes in. Since I adapted this new style, Ikea, the prettiest girl in the school, asked me out, but I stayed with Alexis. I was obsessed with her naturally long hair.

Aunt Doobie died in 2005 on Christmas Day, and so I got moved to a foster home in Philly. My new guardian was Lorraine who sent me to a local barber. Inside the barbershop, the barber was tipsy off a Corona. Like “I go to school high and get high scores,” I thought the beer would help him, but because of him, I went home inveigh. Lorraine looked at me like I was speaking Arabic. I ended up running away from that home because she became negligent to my needs. While on the run, I went to Terry who fixed my slanted hairline. After 3 weeks, my crooked hairline was saying, “It’s here to stay.”

Finally, I got locked up, and so I wanted a clean cut to impress the courts. To no avail, my hairline reminded me of my imperfection. There were two jokes that mar me to this day: “You young with a receding hairline” and “It look like you got shaped up with a shopping cart wheel.” So when I go to the jailhouse barbers, I tell them to shape everything up except the front. Barbers still ask to shape up my front hairline, but I decline their benevolence so I can avoid future damage. I’ve been growing my hair since 2014. My platts now dangle over my forehead to hide my slanted hairline. There are products to aid you in hair growth in bald areas, and until I get my hands on one, I’m content enough with my hairstyle so as to not get another haircut.
