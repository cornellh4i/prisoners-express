**“Look above your head” by Carl Nunnery**

On any given day we always find ourselves looking up to notice many different things that are above your head, things like:

- Planes
- Clouds
- Stars
- Sun
- Moon
- Balloons
- Tall buildings
- Flying birds

Then we have some special events such as the 4th of July fireworks show in the air for its spectacular burst of colors or how about when a spacecraft is launched into outer-space, we watch it go until it is out of eye sight, while we can no longer see it, we are confident it is up there somewhere!

Here is one that not many will stop to think about when they are looking up-ward, and we can find it written in (Thess 4:17) where it tells us how we will too one day ascend up into the air when Christ returns to meet him in the clouds.

Not many actually stop to think of those who have already made this same journey that we all are looking forward to making. We can read about these chosen few in the Bible such as:

- Moses (Matt 17:3) appeared with Elijah and Jesus in the transfiguration
- Enoch (Gen 5:24 & Heb 11:5) God took him without dying
- Elijah (2nd Kings 2:11) God took him alive up in a whirlwind
- Jesus (Luke 24:5) appeared to many after being raised to life

As you have read, Enoch and Elijah went up to Heaven to be with God without tasting death, likewise Jesus said in (John 8:52) that “if a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.”

So where does power come from who can preserve life or with his word can call you up into the Heavens above? Of course, it is the almighty God, who is where? In the Heavens above!

Everything you see in the sky should remind you of the one important thing you can’t see, but nonetheless, you know that he is up above and beyond the things you can see! “God”!!

Tell me if this sounds familiar, something may happen to you, that is unpleasant, what do you do? Raise your hands up in the air and say “Why me lord!” The disciples of Isaiah were experiencing this same feeling where in (Isa 8:21) it says, “they will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry, they will be enraged, they will be turning their faces upward” (paraphrased). It is clear to see whom they blamed for their situation and how they directed it to the sky above (or the Heavens).

We all know God is Above during our good times and our tough times, my point is this, we should always give thanks to God in our good times and pray to our God above during our tough times through our prayers.

In (Psalms 5:3) it says, “In the Morning I will direct my prayer unto thee and I will look up!” Our father God is in Heaven above (Matt 5:16), he has been there since creation, the things we see in the air are his works, so look past the visual in the air to see the unseen and infinite God, we may not see God himself, but we can surely see his works and Glory!
