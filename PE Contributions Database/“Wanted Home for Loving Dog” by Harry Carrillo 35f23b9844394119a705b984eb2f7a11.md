**“Wanted: Home for Loving Dog” by Harry Carrillo**

Tutti is a three year old chihuahua mix looking for a good home. House trained. shots/license. Highly energetic and good with children -- except for when he isn’t.

Long walks with lease, digging holes in the yard, chewing on the corners of the couch, shedding, barking incessantly, and shamelessly licking his privates next to you on the sofa while you’re trying to watch “America’s Got Talent”.

Great pet for family. Smart too. When asked “Who’s a good boy?” understands inquiry is rhetorical and that he, in fact, is the good boy in question.

Not like Gunderson’s goose. Doubt it understands English, much less rhetoric. Geese are stupid, but you can’t tell Gunderson that.

Tutti is one of a kind. Highly perceptive. Sometimes when you’re trying to enjoy a nice dinner with the family, Tutti will sit in the corner of the dining room and stare at you with such sagacity, you’ll swear he understands; like maybe he’s the only one who will ever truly understand you...Not how Gunderson thinks he understands geese. I’ve actually seen him dress that goose in a cloth diaper with safety pins and push it around the neighborhood in a tiny stroller. Talks to it like a child too. Gunderson is a moron, but you can’t tell a goose that.

Tutti is also a great emotional support dog. When Janice and I were going through a rough patch in our marriage, Tutti was her comfort and constant companion. Janice somehow got the notion I was having an affair with a fresh young intern at the office. Not true. By the time I convinced her I had not stepped outside our vows, Janice and I were both physically and emotionally drained. Stayed up late that night making love, embracing and weeping with promises of external fidelity.

The next morning Janice had a glow that I hadn’t seen since our honeymoon. She fixed a pot of coffee and when she went to check the mail and found a pair of white cotton panties next to a dead bluejay on the porch. Janice left me. Took the kids. To top it off, got into it with idiot Gunderson come over after Janice left hooting and hollering that Tutti was in his yard and as a result his goose now suffers a broken leg. Lies. We almost came to blows in the middle of the street!

Did I mention Tutti also responds to several basic commands such as sit, stay, fetch, and heel? Good because I think Janice is having an affair with GUnderson. I can’t prove it, but I can feel it.

Sometimes I still see her driving around the neighborhood. IF she’s not coming to visit me, then who? WHO?

This morning a marshal came to my door with a subpoena. Gunderson is taking me to court. Suing me for vet bills, emotional distress, and his goose ran away so I guess that’s my fault too!

Son-of-a-bitch claims to have evidence of Tutti entering his yard on the sly and driving that bird off in that creepy baby-doll stroller. Ha! Crackpot!

Hope Tutti did take the goose. Who knows, maybe he did.

Perhaps Tutti had a plan all along; to ruin Janice and my marriage and to get to Gunderson’s goose by driving Janice into his arms. Who else left those pantieso n the porce? And next to a dead bird of all things?

Could Tutti not even be a dog at all, but a fox who has outfoxed us all. So, if you are interested in giving -- whatever in the hell he is -- a good home, please contact the number below.
