**Helping Hand by Cesar Hernandez**

My friend crashes her brand new Mercedes Benz E-class in less than one week. At first, she’s so happy she’s able to upgrade from her Mercedes CLK to her E-class.

My friend is constantly drinking wine. After drinking lots of wine, she likes to go for a drive. She’s still getting used to her more powerful E-class. She is used to flooring the accelerator in her CLK.

It’s about 8PM, and she goes for her drive. She floors the E-class and it goes right into a tree that gets in the way. She abandons her car. She’s drunk and she doesn’t need another DWI. She is currently on DWI probation and doesn’t want to lose her driver license.

She calls me and says to come get her. She says she needs me to be her alibi. Her plans are fully formed. I tell her she may or may not go to jail for insurance fraud, DWI, or leaving the scene of an accident. She says we need a suite at the Four seasons. We are having dinner but no alcohol. She needs to sober up before the cops come looking for her.

We speed over to the Four seasons. At dinner we say we are in a rush and need our check now. Our check is time stamped around 8:30 pm. We finish dinner and go to our suite.

In the morning she is completely sober. I drive her home where she “discovers” her E-class is stolen. She calls the police station, the cops say they are looking for her. They found her E-class at 8PM the previous night. A detective comes over to her house.

She’s so happy they found her E-class. He tells her that it’s totaled so she shouldn’t be happy. He asks why she wasn’t home last night. I tell him we spent the day at the Four seasons. I say I think I have our dinner receipt. I show him the dinner receipt that’s time stamped at 8:30 PM. The detective is satisfied my friend did not crash her E-class into the tree. He determines she is not trying to commit insurance fraud. The detective isn’t aware of her DWI probation, otherwise he would probably ask her more questions. He writes up the report.

My friend gets away with driving drunk and totaling her E-class. She does have to pay a lot of money to get a new E-class. She’s happy she doesn't get a DWI nor lose her license.
