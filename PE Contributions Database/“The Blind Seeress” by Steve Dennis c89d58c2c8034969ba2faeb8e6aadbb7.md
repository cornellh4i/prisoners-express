**“The Blind Seeress” by Steve Dennis**

Walking the deserted fairway alone that night was creeping me out. There was no moon at all in the sky, and besides, it was completely overcast. The only light was the flickering ancient neon lights, most of which were in serious disrepair much like the entire carnival. Why had I even come down here? I knew it was going to be nearly empty since it has rained all day and into the evening. It wasn’t only boredom that led me here. The promise of seeing the dancing girls again is what made me decide to brave the weather and pay my entrance fee.

I had been here every night this week. The carnival has opened to large crowds on Friday last week, but after ten days, the rubes had stopped coming. Except for this rube there, here that is. It was Sunday, the final day of the carnival, and I seemed to be the lone customer there. The dance hall was in the back, beyond all the rides, and games, sort of hidden where you had to actually look to find it. It was mere chance the first time I noticed it. I was wandering aimlessly and prepared to call it a night when my eyes spotted a trio of scantily clad honeys ducking into tent.

Following them, I entered an exotic world of flesh and hedonistic delights. It was rather dimly lit, the air was heavy with fragrant odors, predominantly I detected vanilla, but there were many other spicy smells I couldn’t identify. Upon a round stage in the center of the open are a group of naked women were undulating their bodies seductively to the sounds of drumbeats. I counted six of the most gorgeous women up on the stage, grounding their hips in the most overtly sexual way I’d ever seen. I was hopelessly enraptured by the spectacle, oblivious to anything else.

Before I knew what was happening one of the dancing beauties dragged me up on stage. She pushed me onto a low padded leather bench that I hadn’t even noticed before. In stunned silence I watched as all six of the hottest temptresses I’d ever seen began dancing just for me.

Of course, I came back the next night, and the next, and eight more on top of that, which brings me to now. In the nine visits I took to that tent, I had not seen a single other man. Not one. There were plenty of women, women of all ages, all signs, all variety of shapes and colors. The strangest thing to me was that without exception, they were all absolutely gorgeous women. One woman had to be at least eighty years old, yet she was stunning to look at. I saw a girl of perhaps thirteen who possessed an ethereal beauty, a beauty that exuded from her every pore. Asian, African, Latina, European, all of them were luscious. Fat girls you longed to squeeze, women with enormous breast, big fat asses, long legs, skinny girls. It just didn’t matter because they were all smoking hot.

Each night fulfilled another fantasy. There was no limit to what they’d give to me without hesitation, and without judgement. It was a hedonist’s paradise, one I hadn’t even dreamed of before. Every visit seemed to be a dream later when I was at home, or at work, but whenever I returned it was all reality again.

Tonight felt different. To begin with there was nobody around. The air felt colder, and the night seemed darker. When I stepped into the tent, it went very quiet. One woman sat on the stage, just one all by herself, though she too was completely nude.

Approaching her slowly I saw that she was a tiny ancient woman, she looked so frail, I guessed her to be past one hundred years old. Her skin was covered with deep wrinkles, and age spots dotted her hands, arms, chest and neck. Her hair was thin and gray, braided with silver bells and feathers.

Her eyes… when she finally turned her head to look at me I saw her eyes were completely covered in with cataracts. She was obviously blind, yet I knew she could see me, perhaps even see me better than I saw myself. That’s what I felt anyways.

“You have given of yourself unselfishly to my ladies. For that, I thank you,” she said in a voice that rasped in a barely audible whisper. “Your seed has provided us with much needed strength, health, and vitality. Your service will be greatly rewarded. Anything your heart desire will be yours for the asking do not limit yourself with preconceived notions. Ask and it shall be given to you freely,” she croaked harshly.

I actually felt a power radiating from this tiny ancient woman, and I knew she was being sincere. “I want to be able to become invisible at will, with the ability to appear when I choose to do so.” I began, letting my imagination run wild. “I’d like to be able to stop and restart time. I’d ask to have good health and youth for at least three hundred years. The ability to change my appearance, to alter my body shape and size would be extremely valuable” I said imagining the possibilities. “Finally… I’d like to know true love,” I finished wistfully.

“Your request show wisdom,” she rasped softly. “Health and love are yours. Invisibility, time control, and shape shifting take a little longer. You will have your regards I promise you. I ask of you now to once more sate your lust on this stage. Spill your seed in this body, and all your desires are in your grasp” she said, almost pleadingly.

“Are you asking me to use you? Sexually?” I asked at a loss of how to proceed. “You are more than beautiful to me, madam,” I said honestly, “but I’m afraid I’d hurt you if I tried to pleasure you in the way I’m accustomed.”

“You have nothing to fear,” she said in her quietly raspy voice. “My body has known more than you could imagine. Take whatever you want from me, but please fill me with your seed.” She laid back and spread her legs wide, displaying an incredibly youthful vagina. It appeared to be wet, pink and tight.

I removed my clothes as she layed there watching me with her cloudy blind eyes. When I got between her legs I was overwhelmed with her fear that I was about to hurt her, but she laughed and said, “Give it to me son. I can take it I promise you.”

When I entered her, she was no longer the ancient girl creature she has been… Now she was the most incredible sex goddess in existence. Her pussy felt like heaven to me. The taste of it pumped my prick in and out of her the better it felt! The walls of her vagina squeezed my dick like a fist as I drove myself home in her hot, wet canal.

I couldn’t help myself. I was going to cum so hard I didn’t want to stop. Thrust after thrust, I spewed barrels of my sperm into her dripping cunt. Again I was amazed and shocked by the extreme volume of cum I was spurting inside her: it felt as if literal gallons of goo shot out of my cock. Each burst only pleased her that much more. To my utter astonishment, she now looked to be no better than eighteen, and more devastatingly beautiful that I thought possible. Gone were the wrinkles, the cataracts, the raspy voice, all replaced by youthful loveliness.

“Thank you, my son,” she purred like a happy kitten. “You have done far more for me than you can possibly imagine. The gifts you asked for are yours. If you should ever need me for any reason what so ever, just call out ‘mother.’ I’ll hear you and be there for you,” she said moments before she vanished from my sight in a puff of smoke.

“Well, thank you mother.” I said with a smile. I looked down at my flaccid penis and wondered what a foot long dong would look like. Before my eyes, my dick grew enormous in a matter of seconds. I had twelve inches hanging between my legs! I then imaging being invisible… I saw my body disappear! Amazing!

Life will never be the same. I can only barely imagine the possibilities.
