***Eyes* by Shannon Richardson**

You’ve heard the eyes are the window to the soul. Is that is true what do you see in my eyes? Do you see anger? Madness? Revenge? Or do you see peace and satisfaction? Perhaps all of the above? Let me tell my story and maybe you will understand.

Eugeine Rogers was born on October 11, 1917. He was a bright, spirited young man with a great future ahead of him. He was born into a middle-class family with good parents and four siblings. They lived in Georgia in a nice neighborhood.

One cold December day changed the course of his fate. Do you believe in fate? Eugeine sure did, but me? I’m not so sure. I think that every action has a reaction and it can change the course of your very existence, just as Eugeine would experience this day.

Eugeine walked in and took his shoes off, as he always did. The aroma of that night’s dinner hung in the air. His mother was an incredible cook. The fireplace had been lit, giving the house an even homier, cozier feel than normal. THe sound of music came through from the kitchen. Home sweet home.

As much as was right with this picture, there was something wrong. Something was off. The froze in place, trying to put a finger on just what it was that wasn’t right.

Quiet. It was too quiet. His brothers and sisters were a high-spirited bunch who could be heard in any part of the house. But now? All he heard was...quiet.

Something was wrong. You could feel it in the air. He didn’t know what to do. His instincts were screaming at him to leave. To get help. If only he had listened.

He tip-toed to the kitchen. There were pots on the stove. There were books and homework scattered on the table, The radio was playing. There was no one there. He turned the radio off and tip-toed into the living room. He didn’t see anything out of place, but he still didn’t see anyone. He tip-toed up the stairs. He had snuck up and down these stairs a million times, so he was able to avoid the creaky spots on stairs 3 and 5 and get to the top without a sound. He went to his sister’s room first. They weren’t there. Next, he went to his brother’s room. Still, there was no one in sight. He thought he heard a noise in his parents’ room, so he rushed for the door. As his hand touches the doorknob, pain in his head exploded and everything turned to black.

When he woke up Eugeine saw red. Literally. There was so much blood. He saw his family, but they weren’t moving. He somehow knew they were already gone. He felt it in his spirit.

As he was surveying the destruction around him, a boot stepped into his line of view. Then he was looking into a pair of eyes. He could see all the way through those eyes. What he saw was pure evil. There were full of hatred and anger. They raised the hairs all over his body. As the man showed Eugeine his knife, Eugeine told him “I will come back for you. You will pay.” Those were Eugeine’s last words.

Where do I come into the story? Am I the family pet who saw it all? No. Not even close.

After Eugeine’s last words, everything went dark. Then there was such a lightness, he wanted to stay that way forever.Then he remembered in his spirit the sight of his family, his last words, and those eyes. Suddenly, he felt confined. He could barely move. He felt movement around him though. It felt as though he was being pushed. All of a sudden he was free, but so cold. He couldn’t see. Where was he? What was going on? Had it all been a bad dream?

When he was finally able to open his eyes, he couldn’t have been more shocked. This couldn’t be right. He was a dog! That’s right - I am Eugiene - or I was Eugiene, at least. I’m not exactly sure who I am now, but I know I am a dog. Perfect!

During the first few months of my life I nursed from my canine mother, played with my canine brothers and sisters, and grew stronger by the day. Being a dog isn’t so bad. It is much more liberating than being a human. When I was strong enough, I was ready to do what I was born into this body to do. I found my old home. It was cleaned up and had a “For Sale” sign out front. It looked like it hadn’t been lived in after my family. I found my way in through a cracked window. Our scent was everywhere. My mother. My father. My brothers and sisters. Me. We were everywhere in the house. Rather than get lost in the despair that was washing over me, I focused on the task at hand.

I went to my parent’s bedroom- the place where I, as Eugeine, took my last breath. It was then, at that very moment, that I realized why I came back as a dog. As a human, I would have been incapable of finding the man who murdered my family and I. As a dog, however, I had a powerful nose and had no problem picking up the scent of our murderer. Once I had the scent and knew I wouldn’t forget it, I was off. The scent led me through the neighborhood, down a dirt road, and through the woods. The scent led me to the porch of a cabin in the woods. To a pair of boots- the boots I last saw as Eugeine.

As I rounded the back of the property, I spotted my prey. He was feeding his chickens. He saw me and started yelling at me to get away from his chickens. He thought I was there for them? Stupid man! I wasted no time and pounced on the man, knocking him on his back. As I stood on his chest, I looked into his eyes. In that moment, I could see directly into his soul and I believe he looked directly into mine because his face turned to shock and disbelief. In that last moment of his life, I truly believe he recognized me by my eyes.

I took his boots and laid them on our family plot my family and I are buried in. I did what I came to this life to do. I’m finished. Now I can join my family. We can be at peace now. Goodbye world. Perhaps I will see you again. You will know me by my eyes.
