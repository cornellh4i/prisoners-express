My mema and papa spoiled me as a child. I was their first grandchild. I was always showered with lots of love and gifts when I came over. My papa is 85 years old. He was in Pearl Harbor on the gunships. He doesn’t talk much about it. Maybe a lot of bad memories. They moved to Florida after they lost money up north in Indiana. My grandpa was a house builder and real estate developer. His plans fell through for whatever reasons, just bad luck I guess. He’s always a great handyman. He can build and fix anything: cars, houses, lawn care. Whatever needs to get done. He’s old school so he always keeps his wife at the house. My mema is something else. She’s the talker, the accountant, the mover and shaker, and she loves her many statues. When I was a kid I used to hide her little mary statuses from her. I was very mischievous. One time I stole my grandma’s car to go joy riding. I felt pretty bad because she was freaking out. My grandparents are very spiritual catholics and always go to church. I’ve seen them argue and go through it with each other, but, all in all, they’ve stuck it out for 45 + years-- which is more than I can say. My relationships are 1-6 months. Then I get bored and move on. My papa was very silent a lot of the times concerning my abnormal behavior. I just never felt normal, like I was from somewhere else. I never fitted into the nice box they had for me. A lot of my family were college educated, academically inclined, and always had steady jobs. I was all over the place. I could never hold a job for too long. I just didn’t like working for assholes. But they supported me through my ups and downs, and even now while I’m in prison. They finally left Florida and are living in California. Florida was too much craziness for them.
