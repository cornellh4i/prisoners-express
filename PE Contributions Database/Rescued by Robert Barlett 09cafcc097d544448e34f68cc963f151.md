**by Robert Barlett**

Pamela broke Bobby’s arm at the shoulder. He couldn’t tell anyone why, but he was in a great deal of pain, so he cried a lot. A baby’s cry causes a normal adult to come to the baby’s rescue. For some people, though, it’s annoying and can lead to aggression. Pamela shook Bobby, rattling his brain and causing him to have cerebral palsy. That made caring for him even harder.

When Bobby was five months old, Pamela broke his arm again.

In other parts of the world, authorities would have rescued him, but we were in North Carolina. I have a Yankee accent and was obviously not one of the good ol’ boys. Bobby and I were treated with great cruelty and depravity.

For several years my life revolved around trips to doctors and hospitals. I had to work to pay the bills, though I dreaded leaving my children with Pamela. My heart sank when she called me at the office. Her calls weren’t always about Bobby. On one occasion I remember particularly, Laura was bleeding between the legs. Her pediatrician confirmed that someone had ruptured her hymen. She was four years old.

I would have liked to hire a North Carolina lawyer, but I didn’t have the money. Pamela’s drugs are very expensive. Even with the money she earned by medical transcription and prostitution, we faced frequent utility shut-offs and evictions.

My own skills were insufficient. North Carolina’s domestic relations procedures are bizarre. Divorce is complicated enough, but then property, support, and custody matters are handled separately!

Over a period of several years I amassed a huge collection of police reports, medical records and other evidence. When I had overwhelming evidence to prove an airtight case beyond any reasonable doubt, I took my children to the courthouse. In Massachusetts, I’d have been in and out in about twenty minutes, but we were in North Carolina.

Procedures in North Carolina are so different from those in Massachusetts and Tennessee that I had to feel my way as if I’d never tried a case before. After enduring incredible hardships, I won a court decree, but Pamela’s North Carolina lawyer advised her to disobey it. As I was getting ready to go to the courthouse to file a contempt petition, Sgt. King banged on my door and told me to open it.

“What if I don’t open it?” I asked. His reply was quite predictable. My dear, sweet landlady would have been very upset if he’d busted her door down, so I opened it.

Many people were outraged by my case. In most of the civilized world, the prosecutor must prove three things: 1.That an unlawful act was committed; 2. With criminal intent; 3. By the defendant.

I learned that North Carolina does not require any of those facts to give a person a life sentence. N.C.G.S. 5L-B was amended. It now requires the Clerk of Superior Court to provide domestic abuse victims with complaint forms. No one should have to go through what I did. Now help is available.

My children had to grow up without a father, and I’m still in prison. Somewhere, through the grace of God, a child is alive and intact. Through me, He has rescued many children. Knowing that helps me to go on.
