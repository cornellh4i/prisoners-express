**Rescued by Anonymous**

I am the proud father of three sons! They are the beat of my heart and the air in my lungs. My agony is not being with them in these troubling times. While they are all adults now with families of their own, they remain, in my mind, small children prone to mistakes in judgment and in desperate need of my advice.

But I recently received a blessing that reassured me that my youngest son is fully capable of making the right decisions on his own - without my knowledge or input.

Chris, my son, has made me a grandfather for the thirteenth time! You’re thinking I should be used to new babies by now, and you’re right. Even my oldest grandchildren are giving birth, four times so far, with another due shortly next year. I still get excited each time I gain another progeny.

My excitement comes not from the miracle of birth because my newest grandchild is a young lady in primary school. Yes, Chris is blessing me with the adoption of Halona.

Halona is the younger half-sister of his daughter Addison. While Chris is no longer in a romantic relationship with Addison’s mother, they do share joint custody and are amicable.

Halona’s father has chosen not to play a role in her life for some reason. When Chris would pick up Addison for their time together, Halona was left behind. It wasn’t long until Chris began including Halona in their outings and it became the norm that she be included in every excursion, to the delight of both Addison and Halona.

In July, Halona asked Chris to adopt her and be her dad and he readily agreed.

I nearly exploded with pride when I read his email about the adoption. A child needed a child and my child elected to fill that need. How could I be anything but proud.
