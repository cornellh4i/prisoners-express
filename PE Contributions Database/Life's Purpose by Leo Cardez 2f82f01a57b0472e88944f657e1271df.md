“Life’s Purpose” by Leo Cardez

Fear is one of the most powerful forces on the planet. The enemy of change, stealer of ambition, the champion of the half-measure. It dulls the shine of a new idea.

None of us can pretend to be fearless - if we allow ourselves to be truly honest. Yet every day we have the chance to decide how much influence our fears deserve. I wasted a lifetime allowing my fears to dictate my decisions, but in the blink of an eye I decided to leave traditional thinking behind - I wouldn’t fear what the world had to say about me. Instead of cowering behind social stigmas seeking to dehumanize me or worrying about challenges and obstacles, I would simply make the life I wanted. It alone is a statement of defiance to traditional thinking.

So, since that epiphany, my passion has reflected my heart rate. Fast, good. Slow, bad. I figure if something excites me tremendously there’ll be enough people on the planet to make it a worthwhile endeavour - whether that means authoring a memoir or starting a nonprofit organization. If not, then not.

It’s a liberating thing, this leaving of fear by the wayside and pursuing your life’s purpose. And the funny thing about it is that the most successful people are more revered, more awarded, and more victorious in life precisely because they didn’t caution their way and temper their enthusiasm.

A man (or woman) of any form should never compromise, settling for something less than their full potential. If you agree, consider following your life’s dream. Start today. It’s not the most expected path you could take nor will it be the easiest. Yet a little pain and discomfort can be a good thing. Freedom can be found through pain.

Change takes fierce motivation, practice, and repetition. The science of ti almost guarantees most of us will fail.

Then again, some of us won’t.

The reality is there are countless men out there challenging the very nature of their being; constantly changing themselves for the better and reaching all-new levels of success.

As inmates, we HAVE to believe in the possibility of change, purpose, and redemption, otherwise, we might as well be sunk in a barrel at the bottom of the ocean. It’s a despair familiar to anyone who has ever felt helpless. To be chained and locked up with no options - there is nothing worse.

I pray you believe in the power to transform yourself and find greatness - even after failure - to find the freedom and hope that only the pursuit of your life’s purpose can bring. Remember, it can all happen, in the blink of an eye.
