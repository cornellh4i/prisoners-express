**“Emerging From The Fog" by Christopher Velthuysen**

Emerging from the fog of the most fantastic dream, I encountered the robot-like woman who tells me that she runs the planet, and has been doing so since 2020. She also tells me that I’m the last human male alive in Michigan, as I was recently released from prison after nuclear bombs killed all men under and over 50! I, being the “safe” male in Michigan, was kept alive instead of the others. She also tells me that my objective is to re-populate Michigan by having sex with her; whereby she will have millions of children!

I tell her that I’ve never had a sexual relationship with a robot, and she said she would show me how. She then proceeded to get undressed and lay on the floor with her legs spread out and her feet inside a hoist, which could raise her legs upon ejaculation to maximize the output of children.

I, of course, not having a woman in over 30 years, didn’t really care that she was a robot and I just pretended she was a real woman and fucked her good.

We ended up together for 10 years, whereby we had 25 million children and 120,030,000 grandchildren. I died at a ripe old age of 92, and she was still having kids to re-populate michigan

Her name was Beth-Bot, and when she emerged from the fog, it was the best 42 years I had!

Yours truly in 2062.
