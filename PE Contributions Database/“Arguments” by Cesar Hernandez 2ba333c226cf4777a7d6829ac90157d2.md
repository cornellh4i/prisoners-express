**“Arguments” by Cesar Hernandez**

Civilizing process deals with the development of social graces and etiquette, which explains how European Society becomes more peaceful as it emerges from the Middle Ages. If you were invited to a banquet, it was once commonplace to bring your own knife, an instrument that is used both for killing your enemies and for eating food. The problem with all these unsheathed knives around is that there is always a risk someone might get stabbed over an argument. This is not a comfortable situation for either the host or the guests, but violence is part of everyday life in early medieval society; what was there to do about it?

The solution comes in the evolution of table manners, which eventually dictate that it is unacceptable to use your personal knife to eat food, an idea that goes hand in hand with that of cutlery. The fork is invented, and special, less lethal knives are set at the table so that guests do not have to unsheathe theirs in the presence of others. Rules about the proper use of cutlery emerge, mostly concerning what not to do with the table knife–don’t bring it to your mouth, don’t stir ingredients with your knife. What begins as a practical solution to the dangers of provoking a knife fight evolve into a set of ingrained culture rules that also happen to keep conflicts at bay. Over time, these kinds of subtle shifts help develop a value system that sees it as unacceptable to act violently in an ever wider array of arenas. Europeans increasingly inhibit their impulses, anticipate the long-term consequences of their actions, and take other people’s thoughts and feelings into consideration. A culture of honor–the readiness to take revenge–gives way to a culture of dignity. This is moral evolution at work.

As our interactions with each other change, we are forced to reassess our norms. Society then does what it has always done: it ‘polices' the newly unacceptable behavior. Mostly by conveying disapproval and shaming the wrongdoer. Not only is this response aimed at changing that one person’s behavior, it also makes everyone else aware that this is the new code.
