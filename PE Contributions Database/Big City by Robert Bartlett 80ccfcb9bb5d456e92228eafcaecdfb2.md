The maps say Boston is twenty-seven miles from Plymouth. In that case, one should be able to make the trip in about a half hour. I don’t think that will ever happen in my lifetime.

Reading is closer. Both towns had railways that ended downtown, but the tracks in Reading were shiny and heavily trafficked. There were no longer passenger trains in Plymouth, and freight trains seldom rolled south of the Plymouth Cordage Company ropewalk in North Plymouth.

My mother took me downtown several times a year, as I am farsighted and have a lazy eye. Many of the world’s leading medical facilities, including the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, were located in St. Botolph's Town.

My father worked for the Boston and Maine Railroad, so train travel was free. When my mother and I went to the city, we could ride with my father, but our schedules usually didn’t coincide, so we rode separately.

We would spend the day downtown. The doctor visit itself only took a few minutes, but first, the grown-ups had to talk and sign papers. Afterwards, the grown-ups had to again, talk and sign papers. In between was the waiting. I was expected to sit quietly. I tried.

When that was done, we didn’t go straight home. We’d go shopping in one of the big department stores - Filene’s, Gilchrist’s, or Jordan Marsh. In nice weather, we’d spend a little time on Boston Common or in the Public Gardens. I loved the swan boats there.

Once a year, we’d go to see the Christmas lights. We’d do a little shopping. The big Boston stores were fun, but my mother always spent too much time in the clothing floors and not enough in the really fun departments - electronics, hobbies, sporting goods, and, most importantly, toys. If the store wasn’t too crowded, my brothers could go where they wanted, but I had to stay with my mother.

On the top floor of one of the stores - the attic, a huge space that seemed only to be used during Advent - there would be a long line to see Santa Claus. Ropes were set up to create a huge maze through which we’d file back and forth for over an hour. One could never spend much time with Santa, because by the time you got to him, you had to pee.

When I was eight, my parents rented out our house in Reading and began winterizing the summer place in Plymouth. Traveling to the city by car or bus was never as much fun as riding a train.

We never made the trip by boat. There are large boats and ships in Boston harbor and special rules no doubt, but I wish we’d cruised on up the coast of the Charles River at least once. “I love that muddy water.” I still fantasize about tooling up and down the river between Cambridge and Boston, past the Harvard sculling teams and the Back Bay.

Before I became a political prisoner, I got around a bit. I thought Denver was at least as beautiful as Rome, Paris, or London. The landscape was changing in Suffolk County. Some changes were good, others not. Some, I had mixed feelings about, like the Big Dig; but I still regard Boston as the most beautiful city in the world.
