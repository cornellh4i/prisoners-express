**Discouragements by Lorraine Bennett**

When I think of resilience, I don’t necessarily see me, but somebody else I wanted to be, not somebody else, but somebody I’d imagine myself to be.

My life has been full of setbacks and discouragements. I act, I react, I fall. When I get up and shake myself off it’s more like negative buoyancy than real recovery.

Oh, my body itself’s been more resilient than my mind. With its scars, and tattoos, and burns I’m still alive.

Oh, my mind may be sharp after all the drugs, alcohol, and twisted beliefs that crossed its membranes.

I sound good

Look alright…

But I often wonder just how much I’ve lost, how much more I’d be without all the damage done.

I feel no fear but got scared once. I killed that off and am here today. Or is what’s here today just a rubbery concoction shaped to make way until the end of this day.

Do I want to come back? Am I really rebirthed in a few months to come? I don’t relly want to just bounce back.

Just bounce the hell outta here.

How about that?
