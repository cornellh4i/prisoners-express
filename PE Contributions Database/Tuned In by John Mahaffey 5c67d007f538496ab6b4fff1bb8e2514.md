**“Tuned in” by Johnny Mahaffey**

In prison, I’m forced to be tuned in to my surroundings, to keep track of who is who or what- I’d much rather block it all out - but I can’t - it’s a survival thing. I have to know at least some of what’s going on, because the drama of one prisoner has a way of quickly becoming a drama that EVERYONE has to deal with.

People don’t just mind their own business here, not in South Carolina; here they want attention. Inmates (and I use that term selectively) vie for positions of pseudo-authority, anything they can get over the next guy, and the child molestors get first pick. THey have alliances here that ensure them (and their kind) jobs and positions, despite qualifications.

That inmate wants to be a graphic designer? Oh, but this other guy was one (and is one), certified, with experience. Oh, that one you want to hire is a Chester? Well that’s a horse of a different color. Rainbow? Well hell, get that prison “boi” to a computer ASAP!

Melodrama.

It’s one of the things I hate about this place. Hands of one, hands of all. Which is fine in theory, or on paper, but in practice, it sucks. Especially when inmates “in charge” of jobs or programs have no qualifications - and in addition, hail from local playgrounds, still with ulterior motives…

From what I can discern about other states and their prison systems (shown on a local cop self-glorification-station), South Carolina is the only one like this: but, I’m no longer a silent victim to the only one like this: but, I’m no longer a silent victim to the Pedo scurge here, I’m speaking out against it and demanding that those hired or put into position have qualifications, not just buddy-buddy connections of whose mouth is open.
