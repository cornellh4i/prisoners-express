I believe the girl is a good model. And this picture was staged. She’s beautiful and her looking directly into the camera, is intriguing. Yet the rain gives kind of a somber feeling. I can’t help but think if I’ll ever meet this girl. I realize I don’t know her. So the probability of meet her is small. Yet I’ll pay attention to all the TV I watch maybe i’ll see her on an NBC show, who know’s. If this photo is not staged. This girl should be a model. If she not a model, maybe she just got a good shot. I feel this picture was shot on the eastern side of the United States. I guess her age about 23, 24 but not 27. She obviously looks slender, but I can’t figure out her height. I feel she’s American yet this picture could be from Britain. But my money is on American. There’s some details I can’t work out. Yet if I see her again I’ll know she’s the girl from this picture. I’m very good with faces. What I see, I don’t forget.
