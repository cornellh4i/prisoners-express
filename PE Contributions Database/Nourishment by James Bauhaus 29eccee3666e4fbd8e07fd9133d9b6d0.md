**Nourishment by James Bauhaus**

You’re not going to get nourishment in prison. It’s all ground gut-meat and vegetables that are rated one grade above “Animal Feed.” Even worse, now that the cops wave their coronavirus excuse, they’ve got us down to sack lunches twice a day of baloney one meal and PBJ the next. This type of cheap crap saves them money while putting us on the road to colon cancer and obesity. The baloney is full of bacterial poisons to keep it from rotting before  somebody finally buys it. Peanut butter is given to starving children to fatten them up, because mostly fat and starch. I throw the baloney to the prow-bellies who are still young enough to fight the cancer. I toss almost all of the peanut butter to them too. I have to try and live off of what little protein that the cops sell at more than double price from their junk food store. They need to suffer on their own “Nourishment” to see what it’s like.
