**“Never Alone” by David Brown, Sr.**

What a lovely world we live in. Some of the views and landscapes are so amazing. And one can actually see something amazing once and have that memory for the rest of life. The World is making itself cater to our needs and wants by Proper Marketing. There’s a saying that goes “If you want to make some good money sell what people need, but if you want to get rich sell what people want.” Those are things that can be bought. But what about things that can’t be bought, like happiness.

We walk a long road of life. Enduring all that it contains, involves, throws our way, the heartaches, maturing, the trials & tribulations, and the controversy. There is really no book on life, but there’s a book of life. A person has to find their self or find other things to compensate for loss of self. And replacing things with the wrongs is not fixing the problem, it’s adding to the problem.

Even though the road traveled is long, it doesn’t mean we have to walk it alone. Have you ever asked yourself a question and in the same sense answered your own question. That was your subconscious mind, your spirit. Everyone has one. That answer in your head that you have for someone already while they’re still talking to you that’s your subconscious mind. It’s good to give yourself a little quiet time so you can hear it, or at least give it a chance to speak to you.

As you look at me alone, I may seem as if I’m by myself. I assure you that I’m not. I am not lonely either. I’m enjoying myself and talking to the spirit. Even though I walk alone, I am never by myself.
