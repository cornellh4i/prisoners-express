Where must I go? To whom do I call for assistance in this social war? Who said that the American Nazis are just white? The National Socialist Agenda is scattered like 50 billion children’s marbles on a kitchen floor.

I wonder how can I have a leap of fuckin’ faith. And who… is… this dead, chocolate, motha fucka I carry on my so visible shoulders? Did he not affix his God-given gas mask on correctly? And where… the fuck did he come from? I swore to God that I was alone in a one man cell. The Nazis must have adopted a policy of mass murder, death, eradication of the ethnic lives of those trapped in this place they now call prison, correctional center.

Who says they are all white? I know, for sure, that they are not. The Asian Nazi, killed! One of mine, right in front of me. The black Nazis attempt to cut my wrist and break my arm at the forearm bone. So painful… An injury… It’s their mindset; it’s ingrained into their thought processes: submit, piece of shit, nigger. Or die.

Death, I guess! Be sweet if it should ever reach me because submission is impossible. I just survive the psychological warfare. I must survive the chemical warfare like the brothers on which the U.S. Army tested mustard gas. They’ve already subjected me to the biological warfare scenario…

The remnant of such American Nazi horror is littered throughout my systems. I was s caught off guard. It was what they plain…

Now, here! I wonder and pray. What should come next? Should they relieve me of this negro man that died from the last gasing, that I still carry on my shoulders? I know what they will say: “Here. Let me help you. We are here to help you.”

What! Is that how they killed him? The blow of death. How can I look forward to a brighter future when death is staring into my 40 something eyes? What leg? What foot? Should I put all of my weight, all of my what is so philosophically coined as “faith,” in anticipation for my next physical motion?
