**"Breakfast" by Daniel Alvarez**

They say breakfast is the best meal. For the most part, I agree. I always take the time out for breakfast, and on days I forget to eat lunch, I know it's okay since I already ate. On a day that there is a test or quiz, it's good to have a sensible breakfast- not too much, not too little, just sensible, and maybe with a little bit of milk (sorry to all the lactose-intolerant people). One of my favorite components of breakfast is eggs. They come highly recommended from me since not only are they a delight to eat, but they also contain a lot of nutrition. Furthermore, they are also versatile to use and you can even put them in milkshakes! I've eaten plenty of eggs in my youth and I've grown up alright. In fact, I had a chance to go back, I would have eaten more eggs. Another thing I like about breakfast is something that is ubiquitous to every breakfast. That is cereal. But, remember to choose a healthy cereal and to avoid cereals with too much sugar. No matter what your opinion is on breakfast, try to eat well-balanced meals.
