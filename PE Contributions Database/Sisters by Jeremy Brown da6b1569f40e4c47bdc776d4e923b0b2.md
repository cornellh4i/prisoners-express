**Sisters by Jeremy Brown**

Both of my sisters have a close place in my heart. We all went through some tough shit when we were younger. We ended up in foster care together and then the state separated us. I cried every night. I’m getting emotional just talking about it as I’ve found myself once again separated from the ones I love. Sister Rosemary is now a Director for an Advertising Agency. My younger sister Adeline is co-owner of an insurance agency. Both are doing wonderful. Yet Rosemary goes to a psychobabblist to help her with Anxiety. She’s free and has Anxiety, I’m locked up and am more or less freer than ever. Although meditation helps. One day I hope to get a visit from my sister after they have settled in with their lives and hoping for that re-connection.
