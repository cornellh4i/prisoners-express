**Prisoner Lives Matter by Terry Little**

How can I expect them to care about a man convicted of murder and sentenced to enough time, that by the time he’s released he’s plagued with a number of health issues? How can I expect them to care, when black women aren’t even given a chance, when they’re three times more likely to die while giving birth than a woman of any other race? How can I expect them to care when they’re treating me for two dollars per visit to the infirmary, when people in the free world can’t even afford health insurance?

How can I expect them not to feel I’m the blame for the spread of the corona virus??? Well, it’s simple-- they shouldn’t blame me-- I’m not free-- maybe mentally-- but I can’t leave when I want to be. Yet the threatening shouts and reluctant encounters with the inmate population would give anyone reason to believe I am the cause of the outbreak amongst the staff, that inmates deserve to be restricted from the simplest of activities.

Why should I expect them to care? Because inmates are human just as they are.. They are who they are. They are those who ignore the facts; the facts of the pain an inmate repeatedly complains of for two years, had been consistently told it was non-life threatening, or indigestion, then later told it’s an incurable illness; Scenario: An officer gets sick, the works. A day later it’s determined he had the virus. “Announcement: To the inmate population: An officer and an inmate tested positive for the corona virus.” Somehow it’s established, the inmate who’d been incarcerated for years was the carrier… ironic, right?

How can I expect them to take responsibility for their unethical actions, actions which have been proven to be derived from cultures of organizations. How can I expect them to take responsibility when they don’t follow their own rules? When their rules are executed with an inherent bias.

Why should I even expect them to do so? You know what? I know why… because it’s the law of being, not the law of man. It is the scrupulous laws of nature and civility, equality of the man’s presence on this earth, and the understanding of it. If this behavior is continuously ignored, then what’s the purpose of this system?
