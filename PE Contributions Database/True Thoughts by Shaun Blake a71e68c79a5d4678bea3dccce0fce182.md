**True Thoughts by Shaun Blake** 	

Accomplishments. This is such a broad word theme cue. You should get quite the variety of responses.	I’m getting right down to the core of what I think are my greatest accomplishments. The first one is that I’m alive! For anyone this should be a top pick. To be alive for 49 years is amazing. For these of us in prison life can be hard. The lifestyles that lead us to prison are almost always dangerous. So I’m grateful to be alive and expect to be here still in another 49 years. Haha!	The second accomplishment is shared with two beautiful women. Lisa and I have twin daughters. They will turn 22 years old in September and both are presently attending college. Lisa and I were never married. But together we created the most precious creations a person can be a part of. I’m very proud of them.

Melanie and I were married on the 11th of March 1995. Nine months later, Melanie gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. We named her Hope because it is our “Hope” in life. Melanie and I aren’t together anymore. Though in a major way we are together in Hope’s makeup. Hope is a part of both of us (I think the best of both of us) and in this way (along with my twins and their mother) I will live in them even after my physical body leaves the Earth. On 1st February 2017 Hope gave birth to a baby girl–my first grandchild. With her I will live on still longer. These are lights in my dark world that help keep me moving down the road to freedom and success. I’m humbled to be their father and grandfather.

I could list dozens of my accomplishments in my life. I choose the two greatest here and will leave this as it is.
