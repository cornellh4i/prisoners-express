**Clothes by Matt C. Ondreciko**

The prison gives you clothes to wear. It does not matter if they are too big or too small. Just as long as you can get them on. They are not something I would wear on the outside.

I would not be very grateful if I had to wear them all the time. All of our clothes are brown. We only get white socks and white boxers. If we are lucky some of us can still have white t shirts. They got rid of most of the white ones and only give us brown ones.

At the commissary we can order female briefs and bras. You can even order women’s cosmetics. Even other women’s clothing, even women’s shoes and sneakers.

At times, I myself think this place is sick. All of this just to make a dollar. Then when we get a visit, they have us put on a jumpsuit. Just so no one can see our browns that they have us dressed in. At times, I myself feel and look like a clown. Yet I do not know what the other inmates feel like. I can only reply about myself, especially how I feel. Yet we all only get 3 t-shirts and 3 sets of socks and 3 boxers once a year.
