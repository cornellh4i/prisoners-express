**"Island" by Colin Van Billiard**

I was on an island on vacation when a tsunami hit the island, followed by an earthquake that measured ten on the Richter scale. I watched as the door of my hut flew into the ocean. The aftershocks a day after came and knocked down my hut and two trees. The only thing I thought as I walked along the rocks was how I was going to survive. I tried looking for food and walked into the home of where thousands of birds usually were but they were nowhere in sight. I had to get out of the island fast. Miraculously, I heard a helicopter. My buddy, Dan, got so excited and took his shirt off and waved it at the helicopter. The coast guard in the helicopter said it was the worst heâ€™s ever seen. We flew away from the mainland and saw the remains of our hut get smaller and smaller in the distance.
