**"Family Reunion" by Eric Whisnant**

Growing up going to Family Reunions was a big deal. It was a time to get together with family, reflect and enjoy the unity and love of a strong bond. A time to enjoy company of loved ones you didn’t see all that much.

Those reunions will always leave fond memories burned into my mind and my heart that will never go away. The kids playing, the smell of the food and all my great uncles playing music from the bluegrass band they formed, my great grandmother and great grandfather sitting in rocking chairs enjoying 5 generations of kids. Damn, what a beautiful memory!

As time passes, we, as well as all things, grow older as our time grows shorter, and eventually, time completely takes its toll, and we realize that nothing lasts forever. First, my great-grandfather passed and then my great-grandmother. She was the ultimate chain link, but when she died, the chain fell apart. It was the saddest thing ever for me to watch as the whole family decided against meeting at Grandma’s house anymore.

Over time it got apparent that everyone had their own families and agendas going. So our family broke further and further apart. I used to crave the love of family reunions again. That unity as well as a sense of loyalty and friendship. The laughter, the tears, and most of all the love.

All my life I’ve considered myself a realist. A very sincere, loyal, and loving person. And always exposing all from actions to feelings. Never one to hide who I really am and being able to know and accept real life, and its trials and tribulations, I thought if I tried hard enough and keep it 100% legit with all my family and poured all my love back into my family that we would spread that love so that we resurrect that unity, loyalty, friendship, laughter, and tears.

But the closest I got to a family reunion since the death of my great grandmother was prison release parties that were thrown for one of my cousins, brothers or my dad that got released. Times had changed dramatically, my family of love, unity, etc. was gone. Replaced with hate, abandonment, drugs, and fear. Growing up without that love leads to a life on the streets and a life of crime, which comes with the territory of the wrong people and wrong places.

The last release party was not a good one. There were drugs, booze, loose actions, and people. Fights broke out involving the cousin who just got released. I stepped in. and things ended badly. One died, one went home, and I came to prison. It's sad because we were all close family and friends and just trying to have that unity, loyalty, laughter, and tears of a reunion. I guess when I look back we had every one of those things. So I guess we did get what we asked for in a Family Reunion.

This just goes to show how much the people, places, and things of the world change. When my grandmother died, her olden golden family morals and values died with her. Things will never be like they once were in the old days; no matter how I tried to rebuild what once was, it would never be the same. Eventually, my time will come, and I’ll be released back into the world. I will have that option of a “Family Reunion.” I think I’ll break the cycle this time and avoid a reunion. I want to go somewhere and start over hopefully to raise my own family, and at that point, I can try to instill that olden golden morale with the values that my grandmother and grandfather have or had. I want others to experience the same feelings of love, family, unity, and laughter that I felt as a kid. I would give anything to go back to that time and place of a hard-working, and loving family. The sights sounds, and smells of togetherness and love. Damn what a beautiful memory!
