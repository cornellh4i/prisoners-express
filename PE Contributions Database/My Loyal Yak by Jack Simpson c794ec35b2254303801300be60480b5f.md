**My Loyal Yak by Jack Simpson**

I have a friend not like you think. He will stand and wait on me in the bitter cold. The stake that I place on the ground helps to keep him from wandering off in the blinking snow. He has been mine since birth.

When he was able to be food grain. My Dad and I taught him to not fear human touch on smell. In the beginning, he was very skittish. After a while he gave in and learned to trust me.

I live high in places. Most people couldn’t tolerate the high altitude. Being born here helped my lungs adjust to the thin air. Food is very low here and we barely scratch out a living. The yak not only helps to transport everything. It becomes food and clothes.

Our people have been guides for people all over the would. Some people pay good money for our service. One day I will be able to do the same. Maybe I will be the one who will be a lot different.

I am good with my hands. Building things is what I like to do. I’ve built chairs and tables for our family and others. It puts little money in our pockets. A little is better than none.

A stranger came to our camp and wanted to take photos of the area. He knew nothing of the area. My father was bust and it left only me. After my father told him he was busy.

I spoke up and said I would do it. It would only take a week to do all he wanted done. The money would be more than we could make in a year. My Father protested at the idea. He felt I was too young to guide them.

Little did he know, my friend and I had travel all over that mountain, even in the blinding snow and wind.

After a couple of hours of talking, my Father gave in. At first light we would travel for our first caamp. Everything loaded and we started out. My friend wanted to be a little stubborn. He soon gave in as I pinched the tip of his ear. Just a little insurance to let him know who was boss.

On the fourth day out we ended up in a snow slide. Almost lost everything as it buried most of the supplies. My loyal yak was gone and I felt all alone. The only thing I had was on my backpack.

Two men lost their lives and all the pictures now buried deep in the drift. Once the snow cleared and movement stopped, I started down testing the snow powder.

At the bottom where I had figured most of the items would be. To my surprise, I saw movement. It was funny looking at first. I had never seen snow move like that. Most of all with two dark horns per trading upward.

I called to him. He caught my voice in the wind. Not only did he try to free himself more. The more he struggled the more I noticed the packs were still tied down on his back.

When I reached the bottom, he really acted up. I touched his forehead and spoke calmly while trying to free him. He calmed on down. I took a little effort to get him loose. Once on his feet, we started to stretch our legs before we started for home.

I found the photos and the two men that went with me. They were beyond help. Once I had them on the yak we started back. I know that we all had to be careful and not to rush.

These men gave their lives for what they loved. I was so happy to have my old friend back. He was so much fun and I could never replace him.

Now that we have a little extra, I built a room just for him that connects to our house. Once in a while he will stick his head through the door to get a glance at me.

Giving him a warm place to sleep and food, he is still my loyal yak and my best friend.
