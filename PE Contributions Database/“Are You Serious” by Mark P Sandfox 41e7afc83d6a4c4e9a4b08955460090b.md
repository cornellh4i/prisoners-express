**“Are You Serious” by Mark P. Sandfox**

****It was not Zales, or Tiffany’s, or Kay’s. It was a no name, dimly lit, old-school jeweler tucked away in an office building off State Street. An old wrinkled jeweler with big meaty hands handed the smiling couple a small box, inside of which lay their wedding bands. The manboy, all dapper in his faded jeans, T-shirt and flannel, handed the jeweler a rubber banded roll of bills. The smiling girl, redundant in faded jeans and bright blouse, cooed her brown eyes while hugging his arm, beaming eyes begging for his attention. Cool as a cucumber, the manboy looked into her eyes and was lost. They kissed, long and passionately, a “get a room” type kiss. The jeweler rolled his eyes.

The girl pushed on his chest with a sigh, then looked at the jeweler, blushing and giggling. She grabbed her beau’s hand, dragging him from the jeweler’s store. They raced to the elevator, an old rickety type that rattled when it opened, rattled when it closed, and rattled all the way down, not that the couple ever noticed locking in another passionate embrace.

The sun, the smog, the engines and horns, the scuffling murmurs of lunch hour feet, the flushing airbrakes of impatient buses, the general discordance that is State Street, greeted the smiling couple. Stepping out from the protection of the concrete tower they were engulfed by the congested throng. Hand in hand, they were carried away by its flow. Block after block, they huddled to each other’s side, smiling in the comfort of each other’s company while being pushed and shoved at the mercy of the mosh-like throng.

Without warning, like some unheard school bell signaling the start of class, the throng of scuffling feet dispersed, faded, trailed away, draining like funnels into the concrete towers. The change was so abrupt it stopped the smiling couple in mid-stride; they felt eerily alone. Their eyes connected, gazes melding. He leaned down, she tiptoed up. They kissed, like high schoolers in the middle of an empty school hallway. Love, life just doesn’t get any better. Her hand came up to his chest, their internal signal for a breath of air. They parted. Hand in hand, they continued their stroll down State Street to the subway.

Here she comes just a walkin’ down the street…

Long straight dark hair, just like hers, only shinier. The shape of her face could pass as her sister, only younger. Trim and curvy, only firmer. She approached, his eyes locked on the jiggle of her breasts. There was an air of freedom in her step. Brown eyes, just like hers, only softer, vibrant, sparkling in the sunlight. He locked onto those brown eyes, waiting for them to meet his. She passed without a glance.

At first it was only his eyes that had followed her passing, but when she passed, his eyes dragged his chin around until it banged into his shoulder. He was still holding his fiance’s hand when his chin pushed his shoulder back, hips turning to save his balance, feet sidling so not to stumble. His back was not to his fiance. He whistled.

A moment of echoing silence.

“ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!” Her hand grabbed his lead shoulder, her jaw flopped in disbelief, brown eyes turned into daggers. “Five days until our wedding and you are catcalling?”

Still holding hands, her grip on his shoulder taloned, ripping his attention around to her. She was speechless. He was lost. They stared at one another, his left hand still holding his right hand. Then her right hand wound back. Like a hook from a prize fighter, her anger uncoiled, slapping him soundly across his cheek. She yanked her left hand from his right, ripped the engagement ring from her finger, then tossed it violently into the street. Right on schedule, an impatient bus rolled over the ring.

There were no words spoken. None were needed. She simply stormed off, leaving him standing alone, gulping for words that would never fix the damage done. Her long, shiny dark hair swayed from side to side. Her bounce was angry, her hips sassy. She did not look back. He turned around, looking for the distraction. She was gone, vanished. Was she ever really there?

Another bus rolled over the discarded ring. He waited until it passed. He stepped off the curb, then plucked the ring from the asphalt. The gold was scratched, the mount bent and smashed, the diamond flawless. He glanced after his fiancee, gone, done and gone. He searched for what had distracted him, nothing. He had nothing. He tucked the ring into his pocket as he walked back to the jeweler.
