***Free at Last* by Michael Chris Morales**

****Growing up as a kid was hard because my dad did drugs and was always in the street and mom went to prison. I was left in Grandma’s house, and when I was about 13, I turned to the streets and never looked back. After moving house to house, wherever I could lay my head, I ended up in a group home for most of my teenage years. At 18, I went all out: I stole from anybody and everybody, and stole so much that it became a way of life. Stealing supported my addiction to crack cocaine, a drug which numbed my thoughts so I couldn’t feel or think. All I looked toward was getting high. Anything someone said would go in one ear and out the other, and I stayed away from people so I wouldn’t hear them. I was a loner, and the devil had me in his hands. I used to pray to God but felt that nothing ever happened. The crack had me in a chain I couldn’t get loose.

I hurt my family the most. I lied and would leave without coming back. Sometimes it felt cool and fun, but that was only when I was high with money. As soon as I was broke, I was depressed and felt like no one loved me. I blamed everybody and their momma for my life. I wondered why I couldn’t have a mom and dad, my own room, a normal life. I trusted no one, including myself. I was so out of control that I should have died a thousand times.

By 30 years old, I done been to juvie, city jail, state jail, prison. I’ve been in prison on-and-off for about 15 years, and being locked up is my second home. I’ve caused others and myself pain and suffering, and no words or actions can take back what I did. What woke me up was being away from my wife and 4 kids. Being hurt and mad at myself, I knew that I couldn’t see them again without getting rid of my bad habits. At first, I thought I could stop by myself, but I was wrong. God is the only way you’ll ever be free from negative, evil, bad, wrong ways. I always knew about Jesus Christ but never truly accepted him until about 3 years ago when I picked up the Bible and never put it down. Now I pray throughout the day and do Bible studies; I am living for God now. Some people think I’m faking or losing my mind, but I know that I was lost and that now I’m “free at last.”

Life is more than stealing, running the streets, and getting high. Life is about doing God’s will. I’m so happy to be alive, and I look forward to getting out and being with my wife and kids. Their lives don’t stop for me, and when I touch down August 2, 2017, I’ll have God on my side to help me every step of the way. If you trust in God with all your heart, don’t listen to your own thoughts. Remember God in everything you do, and He will show you the right way. Then you’ll throw your hands up in the sky and thank God, telling yourself, “I’m free at last!”
