Thinking of laughter made me recall a story that I was fortunate to see with my own two eyes, and I would like to share it with you. It was a time when I thought that I was never going to be able to stop laughing. It was back when I still laughed uncontrollably and unreservedly, the way that only a child or those truly pure of heart can laugh.

My grandparents came over for a visit. I love it when they came over because my grandpa would tell all kinds of stories about my dad when he was growing up, and then when I would do something wrong I’d tell him “but grandpa said you did so and so” in an attempt to get out of trouble. It never actually worked, but I would still try it. On this day my grandpa, dad and I were sitting out on the back porch when we saw one of the old stray cats that hung around eating the scraps that mom would leave out for it. It was stalking a squirrel that had ventured away from the tree. I should pause here and tell you about this cat: this cat was absolutely the fattest cat I have ever seen. I don’t mean just a little overweight or a little bit chubby. I mean severely and morbidly obese if that term can be correctly applied to cats.

He was stalking this little squirrel like he was a lion stalking his prey in the Serengeti. He would take one cautious step forward then stop and watch his prey. At first, I thought that the squirrel was unaware of his presence, but that notion was quickly dispelled. When the cat crossed some invisible line of demarcation that apparently only the squirrel was aware of, it would turn and bolt for the nearest tree. If you thought that would dissuade the cat’s hunt, you are as mistaken as I was. He was hot on the heels of the squirrel even climbing up the tree as well. He was doing well until he came to the curve in the bole of the tree where it bowed outwards. The squirrel had no trouble negotiating the twist of the tree’s trunk. The fat cat was not nearly as nimble and had considerably more trouble during his attempt to traverse the bend. In fact, he had so much trouble that he didn’t make it and he fell--and fell hard.

Remember how in school we were told cats always land on their feet when they fall? Not this cat. Papa had no filter between what he thought and what he said, and so when he saw the cat fall out of the tree, he said, “SOB, did you see that cat fall out of that tree? Papa was as country as biscuits and gravy for breakfast. When Randy Travis came out with his hit song “I thought he walked on water” I was sure it was written about Papa.

My dad and I looked at each other and just began to laugh and laugh. We were laughing so hard that it brought Mom and Grandma both out to see what we were laughing about. When my Mom asked what we were laughing about, my Grandpa repeated what he had just said a few minutes earlier, which of course brought on a whole new bout of laughter. The cat died, and so we buried it beneath the tree that he fell out of, which to my way of thinking, kind of seemed like an insult. I mean to be buried under the very thing that caused your death is akin to the hunters that use the mounted head of a trophy deer as a gun rack. I asked a teacher later on why he thought the cat didn’t land on his feet. The only explanation that he could offer was this: that since the cat was so obese, perhaps he had a heart attack from the exertion of climbing up the tree and that may have been the reason for his fall.

I don’t know about the science, but I know he put on a great parting show for all of us. And, if you know of a better theory please just write me and let me know.
