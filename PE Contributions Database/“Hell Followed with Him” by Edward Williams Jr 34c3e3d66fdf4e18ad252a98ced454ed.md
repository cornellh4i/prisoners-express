**“Hell Followed with Him” by Edward Williams Jr.**

Such tender little feet… Who could have ever guessed that they would become the feet of a monster? Isn’t it odd to think that the Antichrist, like many of us, also had a father who gently held his little limbs?

That poor father didn’t know. He was ignorant. He didn’t know, at that moment, that his son would conquer kingdoms. He wasn’t aware that his boy would embitter lives. He had no clue that these soft, sweet, silken little feet would tread truth underfoot, stomp saints into the dirt, and kick the whole world into darkness.

But what if, what IF he had known? What if he had known that these feet would, one day, stand as a king, a false god? What if this unknowing father had been shown the days where these toes would wriggle and clench excitedly in the blood of the righteous. Perhaps, if he had known, this would have been a mugshot instead of a snapshot. When he got to prison, none of the other inmates would ever understand him or believe him, having never lived under the tyranny of his deceased son. Would such an act really be moral or not? A hard question…

No matter, it can’t be stopped now. These feet, these little feet? They’re grown now and already on the prowl, hungrily hunting for the opportunity that will exalt them to the pedestal of God on Earth. Do you hear them walking?
