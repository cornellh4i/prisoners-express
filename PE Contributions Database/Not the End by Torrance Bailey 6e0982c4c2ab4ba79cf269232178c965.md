**"Not the End" by Torrance Bailey**

I hear the hiss of rockets and missiles and the explosions from afar. Rapid gunfire is in sync with the other sounds and the ground shakes. I am afraid. Where to run? I'm lost! Which way to go? Nobody knows. I try not to panic but it's impossible.

The fight or flight instinct in my brain has kicked into overdrive. My hands are bare, with nothing to fight as reality sinks in. Common sense tells me that the only thing left to do is run. However, my legs can't move. I standstill as the shakes and rumbles approach closer and I feel the reality of the situation. The fire was too close, and I burst out running as fast as I could. I ran as far away from the frightening explosion and near-death contraptions until my legs could no longer move. Now I’m walking, slowly, until I finally stop with eyes blurred from the sun. I don’t know how far I ran, nor how long, only that I needed to getaway. Only with the sounds faint, and explosions left in the distance did I feel safe.

Finally, my breathing simmers and I raise my head and place my hands behind my head. In front of me, I see an ancient burial. This place meets my eyes as a sense of peace and calmness overwhelms me. However, though exhausted, I still think to myself, I hope this is not the end of my journey, or is the beginning?
