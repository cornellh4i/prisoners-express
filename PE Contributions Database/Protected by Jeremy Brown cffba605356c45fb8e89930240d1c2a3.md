**“Protected” By Jeremy Brown**

Last year, in 2016, my ex roommate and ex boyfriend pulled a knife on me. He was so high on K-2 that he lost a sack of pills of ecstasy. I was blamed. There are only three responses in a situation like this: fight, flight, or freeze. I chose the latter. I was frozen. All these situations were running through my visual cortex. If I fight him, we’re fighting to the death. Then I’m going to The row or CM for years. Not an option. I’m not stupid. Years of meditation and to just throw it away on a whim! Inexcusable. So I froze and assessed the situation. I said to Chris, “Do you think your God or Jesus would want you to kill me?” This stopped him dead in his tracks. He put the knife down and we talked and retraced our steps. At the time, we were selling. Both of us have L bows (Life without Parole) so we don’t get paid or have jobs, our other option was to sell. The main issues with selling is The evil and connived Demonic Entities you have to deal with on a daily basis who have possessed those of weak character. Lots of tricksters and master manipulators come in the sanctuary of my dwelling, in which I would use discernment so no one could take advantage. Someone stole the bag of X and it was a big mistake on Chris’s part. Did I mention fear?, so much was going through me, it was crazy. After that, mistrust settled in our business and personal relationships. Something made Chris freeze though. An invisible paranormal force created an invisible impenetrable barrier that would not allow him to harm me. Protected. I think so, I could feel it. Chris was my first and last relationship here. No more! I have enough of my own demons and shit to deal with, I sure as hell don’t need others. Now that’s off my chest. Breathe in, breathe out…..
