**"A Different World" **by Robert Richter**

We thought we were soooo cool. This was back when smoking was the cool thing to do. Of course, none of us were actually smoking in the picture. Danny, on the left, was puffing a little smoke in his mouth, but that’s it. We all just wanted to look like we were smoking. We weren’t stupid enough to actually DO it!
