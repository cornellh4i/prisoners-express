**“A Full Life” by Blaine Olivas**

Time has withered the flesh woman and its significance to the depths of reality. It is challenged with every turn and known by all who are, but as the clock has ticked, no sense of love will pass without the warmth of my honor. Embraced by the intensity elated by time’s wonderful opportunities and favored by its choices and possibilities, I can only see how I have lived. Shared in all my intentions, the smile on my face patiently waits for my pleasures to be indulged again.
