I never thought it would be this easy, and I figured that I was underestimating the savviness of the average person. Wrong.

I am up to over 20 followers in my cult now; it’s small but ferociously devoted with great prospects for more growth. Half a dozen signed their houses and accounts over and have started a trend that others are going to follow. I want for nothing now -- anything that is theirs is mine, including their women. They consider it an honor to give to me and the movement.

Why are they so eager? I have the confidence, charisma, swagger, and answers. It doesn’t matter whether they can be backed up or substantiated in anyway because these people just want something to fill their inner holes.

You want a god? I’ll be that god for you and relieve you of your guilty sins weighing you down. Do you need a miracle? I’ll make you see miracles in the most mundane occurrences then convince you that whatever does happen is what you really wanted and needed.

No more need to think: I’ll chew up all the tough questions that haunt you then I’ll feed you like a mother bird feeding her young. No need to feel pain anymore: this religious zeal will sweep over you and sedate you like the strongest of opiates, suspending worldly feelings and any reasoning you have left.

So kneel before me and surrender this worldly burden which plagues you. Experience true freedom and paradise, my child.
