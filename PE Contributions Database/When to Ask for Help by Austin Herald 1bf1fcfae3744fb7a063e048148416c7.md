**When to Ask for Help by Austin Herald**

I went into the deep cave of life to see where it goes. The line of destruction and the lost loved ones along the way. I never realized how devastating things would get with each rock I used as a jump along the pathway. I just keep jumping to the next one, never stopping on any to think about life’s steps. Into the deep hole I was heading into, not hearing the cries to help me. I still saw specks of light along the path shining through. I just started leading myself away from all of the voices saying “be careful, don’t just sit around, work through this.” I felt so alone, not being able to tell a soul what I was doing, nor did I want anyone to know. I drugged deeper and deeper, never looking back for those that I could have gotten help from. I kept jumping around each rock as it tried stopping me in the pathway, saying “go back, go back, ask for the help you need.” I decided darkness was too much, at some point, I turned around. The walls fell into total darkness. I had hidden too long. I had hidden from the truth too long. As the FBI stopped me and started questioning me, they knew everything, everything I had done along the way. The lights got brighter and brighter with each question that I was asked. The boulders got smaller on the way back to the front of the entrance of the cave. I was so deep in the cave, I could not even tell you, but the lights got brighter as I headed towards the front. I never knew how far I was ripped apart from the help that I could have had. I came to the front of the entrance. The weight was lighter on my shoulders knowing I was getting closer to the help I needed. Looking out at the free world, knowing it was not free for me anymore. The rest of my life, I will always be looked at under a magnifying glass. I will always have questions to answer wherever I go, whatever I do.
