"Beauty & the Bench" by Steven Adam Miguel Umholtz

In 1984, I opened the door to father’s office, walked in, and there she was. In an instant, the most beautiful girl I had ever seen with the bluest eyes had captured my heart at first sight. I said to myself, "*I’m going to marry that girl someday."* I was 14 years-old and 10 years later in that very church building where my father preached and where we first met, I did just that.

11 months later we had our first child Hannah, my pride and joy. We moved into our little house in the Ocala National forest that my great-grandmother had given us. I was deeply in love with my wife and could not wait to get home each day just to spend time and be with her. It was like a dream come true every day when I woke up and saw her in bed right beside me. As a result, over the next 15 years, we had 10 children together.

One day, I had come home one afternoon and spent some great, passionate quality time in bed with my wife and we eventually fell asleep. In a dream, I was in a park and there on a bench was a beautiful deep blonde. I’ve always had a thing for blonds and my wife knew it. In the dream, I walked up to her, sat down, and we began talking. One thing led to another and she kissed me. Before you knew it, we were making out right there on the park bench. It was so intimate, she had to have a cigarette afterward. So I sat on the ground looking up at her thinking*, wow, that was great and boy she sure is beautiful!* 

Then all of a sudden I was getting punched in the side, and I woke up to find my wife delivering the punches! I threw the blanket and covers over her and said, “What is your problem WOMAN?”

“YOU!” she exclaimed.

“What did I do?”

“You were cheating on me with a blonde on a park bench!”

“Are you crazy?”

“No! I was just dreaming it!”

In shock, I asked, “Was she good looking? Where was this ‘park bench’?” Needless to say, I was punched again.

Every time after that when she would see a good-looking blonde woman, she would nudge me and say, “Honey, blond alert!”

I would respond, “Woah baby, where’s a park bench when I need one?” I’d get punched affectionately and that night we would put our “Park Bench” to good use in our bedroom.

And that’s THE END of That Beautiful True Tale of some Tail on a Bench.
