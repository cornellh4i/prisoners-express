**“Stain of Hurt” by Victor Andrew Apodaca Sr.**

Blackened by one strain of hurt. I wonder why I must

hurt. I am not willing to give in, but there’s ‘no’ way to win.

The stupid things people do to me makes me angry and want

to hurt you and me…

I don’t understand what they think I am, in this concrete

jungle. You must not speak to people in charge or you’ll have

to pay with blood… And that’s one way this life

in Hell is to me with no one to blame except you and me…

Expect yourself when you put yourself in such a bad

place; all the Demons from this Hell will make you

Hurt and that’s why I can’t understand why you place

your heart in that place to make someone hurt you in this

Awful place....

I have to do what I must to live and walk the line

straight and tall because if you’re weak, you’ll never make it

out of this place, even may die for no reason. It’s my way

to stay alive. But no one cares, not one soul. The Blood you

spill darkens your soul...
