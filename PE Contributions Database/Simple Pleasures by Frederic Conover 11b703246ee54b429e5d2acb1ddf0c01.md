**"Simple Pleasures" by Frederic Conover**

Watching the sun rise

A favorite song

A gentle smile

Body ink

Snowcap mountains

Pretty eyes

Green eyes

Listening to the wind blow

Amusements parks

A child being born

Peace

Campfires

Someone to love

Sailing

Star lit nights

A Kiss

A walk in a park

Dreaming

Being young

Freedom on my mind

Watching the sunset

A rainbow
