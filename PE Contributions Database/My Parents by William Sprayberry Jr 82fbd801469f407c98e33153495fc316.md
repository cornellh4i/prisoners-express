**“My Parents” By William H. Sprayberry Jr.**

The two people I’ve hurt the worst, are the two people who mean the most to me. I don’t mean to hurt them, but actions truly do speak louder than words. My actions cause hurt, disappointment and heartaches. Heartaches cause pain. That’s why they hurt the worst, because they love me the most.

My parents had me when they were very young. My brother came a year later. They did everything they could to give us the best life possible. We never wanted for anything.

My dad traveled a lot. He was always a hard worker and instilled that in us. My mom was never without a job either, once we got to that stage where we were no longer toddlers. Seeing them work so hard just to provide for us, made a lasting impression.

As sad as I am to say it, there’s been a lot of times when I would rather get high, or sell drugs, than become a real working member of society. Even when I was lost in the fantasy land of becoming the white Pablo Escobar I was never truly happy with that. The reason why is because I knew better. Deep down inside myself, I knew that a real man works. It’s what this country was founded on. That’s what I learned from my parents. I never felt quite right trying to earn the quick dollar.

We live in a day and age when the media glorifies drug lords, and then we sit and wonder why so much of the country tries their hand in selling narcotics. El Chappo escapes and it makes front page headlines in the newspaper. The guy the movie “Blow” was based on gets out of federal prison and TMZ has reporters covering it. Some model gets busted with a couple of suitcases of drugs on an airplane and suddenly she’s made the rotation on CNN.

Kids see these people. They are famous. And who doesn’t want to be famous? A child doesn’t know the difference between famous and infamous.

So when kids who don’t have the greatest parents see all these drug dealers on tv, they look up to them. It’s all they have.

When they realize they aren’t gonna be the next Johnny Depp because their acting skills just aren’t up to par, they can’t shoot a basketball like Lebron James, and they don’t have a father figure who cares, then their dream to be famous doesn’t go away just because the talent it’s there. They think anybody can sell drugs and maybe get famous. It’s worth a try.

Hell, I was even stupid enough to try it, and I have good parents. So I really feel sorry for the kids who don’t.

My parents don’t do drugs. They don’t even smoke weed. I was taught that drugs are bad, and to stay away from people that do them. I listened until I was 18. It was all downhill after that.

Perhaps that’s another reason why I never felt happy and content using and selling drugs. As a kid, I thought people who did drugs and sold them were losers. So it was with shame when I looked in the mirror and saw that I wasn’t staying away from those people anymore. I had become them.

Drugs have done nothing but ruin my life. I’m 35 years old, been to prison 4 times, and done around 10 years. I’ve caused my mom a lot of tears, even my dad a few, and he’s not what you would consider a crying man. In fact, the only tears I can remember him crying were over me. Imagine living with that.	I can’t undo the hurt I’ve caused to the two people I love more than life itself, but I can be the man they raised me to be from this day forward. I no longer want to be like Pablo Escobar who’s now dead. I no longer want to be like El Chappo who’s in prison. I don’t want to be like the guy from “Blow” who lost his daughter. I want to be like William Sprayberry Sr. If I have a daughter of my own, I want her to be like Brenda Moore, who’s my mom. Those are my parents. I thank God they were my role models. If the world put amazing people like these on the front page of newspapers it would be a much better place. We’d still make mistakes, but we’d also know better.
