Wow! Now that’s my kind of place. Air so fresh you can taste it. Air so clear you can see all the stars. Bet there’s good air in them parts, and good snowboarding too.

But really, that’s my type of place. It seems perfect for so many things, like vision trips, A.K.A. journeying. I love taking people on journeys. It would start out with some whiskey, not a whole lot but maybe 6-7 shots, since it relaxes the mind. Then a couple of joint to settle the stomach for the mushrooms. And a couple drops and some buttons, if available. Now we sit and wait. I would direct you to focus on something, such as a fire, the clouds, the birds. You should focus, but yet let your mind wander until your answer manifests itself.

With an entirely open mind, it’s that easy. Still, we always watch for signs afterwards. Signs can be anything and anywhere: cracks in the sidewalk, something in a book, a dream. It even, at times, just pops in your head as if placed there by a muse.

Places like that in the picture are gifts from the gods. Beautiful gifts. I see it as peace, a wondrous peace.
