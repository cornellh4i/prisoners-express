**“The Last Hinder” by Scott R. Shoolts**

The world I see at night is green or intense white upon a black background. Special contact lenses allow me to see the infrared and thermal spectrums of light. I am very fast and can lift over five hundred pounds with ease. I can communicate with any commanders and support personnel by just thinking what I need to say. I can record or send images live back to any command with the cameras built into my eyes. Information I need floats in front of my face phantom like— an iPad in the air.

For the last three days I’ve been following a floating map. A cop’s light on the map keeps moving. I must locate the sources of the light.

The woman is lying in a ditch surrounded by garbage. She cannot stay in one place long. Even though it is night, the darkness doesn’t offer total protection. The terrorists have flashlights and the lights on their vehicles. And, in places, the street lights in the town work. She gathers herself and moves to another location as fast as she can without making noise. The night air is cool on her face. She looks at her phone when she sees the vehicles coming. She streams live the men who dismount from the trucks. She streams live the men executing people in the streets. And then she moves again. And again. And again.

Three days before the killings began she was an aid worker from India. She is a hinder. The terrorists who killed all of the other aid workers in the town when they took over are searching for her. They want to kill her. They believe she is a spy.

The city ahead of me is green. I hear the gunfire. I see white flames tinged with green everywhere. The city is a warzone. There are trucks with mounted machine guns everywhere. The gunners in the backs of the trucks seem to be shooting everywhere indiscriminately. I see this all. And I see the last. I am very fast. So I move.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bam, bam, bam! The woman is running now. The terrorists run for their vehicles. Some chase her on foot. They all shoot at her. She zigzags and runs behind a building. She sweats. Her hair is wild. Her breath is fast. She runs.

The vehicles are coming. She hears their engines. Sees their lights behind her. Shadows drive around her. An abandoned building to her right. She jumps a dusty puddle and hurries inside, up a dark set of stairs to the second and then third floor. The trucks outside are everywhere. She hears more shooting. Random shooting. She reaches the roof of the building through a hole where a door once was. From a shadow she watches the terrorists. With her phone she streams them live.

Boom! An explosion in the lower levels of the building she is in. A grenade. Voices shouting. Footsteps on the stairs. There is nowhere else to go. The woman looks about for an escape route. She turns the phone on herself.

“My family, my friends, I love you all. They are coming up. I have no escape. I love you. I will film them when they come for me. The whole world can see their evil.” She does not cry as she turns the phone towards the stairs.

“Bitch! Drop the phone! Drop the phone!” the masked terrorist screams.

The others with him say nothing. They rush her. Hate in their eyes.

I am very fast. I can jump very high, and I have many weapons. When I land in front of the woman, who has been the light I’ve been following, she recoils with surprise. The terrorists look shocked for that brief moment before they became dead.

I am fast. All the terrorist in the building die in a flash. The ones outside in the trucks stop breathing just as quickly. Then I go back up.

I am very strong. Within minutes the woman and I are out of the city. I carry her with ease.

When the helicopter comes out of the sky the woman speaks. “What are you? What are you?” she asks.

She is pretty. Her face is dirty. Her hair is messed up. I reply, “Something new.” I grin.
