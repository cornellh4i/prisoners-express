**“Finding My Parents” by Don Schunke**

I was adopted at birth, well shortly after actually. I was flown from Superior, WI to Green Bay and delivered directly to my parents’ house. How’s that for service? A bouncing baby boy delivered directly to you. I was born during a Lake Superior Snowstorm, they had to shovel out the car and engine to get my birth mom to the hospital. At first, she was not sure about giving me up, but 3 months later she signed the papers and 5 days later...I was taking my first plane trip.

My adoptive parents had always shared with my brother and me that we were adopted (separate birth families), so there was never confusion. I tried to find my birth parents when I was in college to no avail. Then in my 30s, I was in a regional production of *Annie* and while searching for a prop, I came across my search paperwork for my adoption. Now, with the internet available, I figured “What the Heck” and I’d try again. This time I found a hit - my birth mom possibly was searching, but the birth date was off by a day, December 23, not 24th. But as I was born at 12:30 AM that was easily explained. Besides, how many boy babies would be born in a city that size and adopted? So I emailed the site owner, a long time adoption search coordinator.

I checked my email several times that next day from work, as well as my answering machine - nothing. So I went to the show that night and let the rest of the cast know what was going on. The actor playing “Rooster” commented that he hoped she was better than “Annie’s” fake adoptive parents, “Ralph and Shirley Mudge.” A funny comment as it would later come to light. I checked my answering machine during intermission - still nothing. After curtain call, I rushed home - 15 minutes to do the normal 30 minute drive! Yes! There was a message - “Call me, I think there is a match.”

I called and gave her some extra information and she said yes it is a match. She said the birth mom was also waiting for a call back from her - why didn’t I just call her instead - and she gave me the number. I hung up and called my adopted mom, who was even more excited than I was. I told mom I’d call her right back and dialed the number.

“Hello?”

I said, “Hello, I think you are expecting a call tonight. I think I’m your son.” We talked for over an hour until my call-waiting beeped (mom wanting to know what was going on). We discovered many strange things - remember Annie? Her name was Shirley! And her last name was very similar to Mom’s remarried name. She had gone to school for and was a reading specialist. I had gone to school for elementary education with reading and library minors. And at one point we had lived less than 30 miles apart and had gone to a conference in the city where she was currently living. Too strange, huh?

About 5-6 years later, i got a call on my birthday from the International Reunion Soundex Registry who’s paperwork I’d filled out back in college. This organization tries to find matches between adoptees and birth parents (or adopted siblings split up). They had upgraded their computers and found thousands of potential new matches. My birth dad has ironically also been searching the whole time, but had the wrong birth year. The lady from the Soundex Registry said she would look further to see if she could find a phone number or address for him. She called back 2 days later, she had bad news - he was dead - murdered in a 10 year old unsolved mystery. I was able to find news articles online about the murder as well as his obituary. I was able to track down some aunts and uncles. One of whom still writes to me here.
