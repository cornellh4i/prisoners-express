**“The Things I’m Grateful For” by Chad Frank**

As I sit down to write about gratitude, I realize I have a lot to be grateful for. I’m grateful that I’m in a safe and fairly tolerant environment. As a sex offender, at the other prisons I’d face harassment and violence. For the most part, here at Butner-Low, I’m pretty much left alone and can do my own thing.

I’m also grateful for having such an understanding and caring boyfriend, Jeff. If I’m being honest, I don’t deserve him, considering how I’ve been such a selfish, inconsiderate jerk toward him. And that makes me all the more grateful to have him in my life. I’m also grateful for having so many supportive and talented friends. They renew my faith in humanity. They make me want to be a better person and continue honing my skills as a poet and writer.

I am most grateful for my family. They have remained supportive of me throughout this ordeal. Some people aren’t as fortunate. Last but not least, I am grateful for Prisoner Express for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings.
