"The Sanctuary" by Anthony Montecino

I have given up the materialistic things of the world, and decided to focus on eternity. This is my island/rock. I live alone. I am one with my surroundings. My daily sustenance is provided by my devotees who come to hear the revelations of my prescient visions.

I remain in a trance-like state most of the time. I am at peace, I can feel the moist air breeze, I can taste and smell the salt of the sea, I can hear the splash of the waves against the shore of my island along with the birds of song. Days, weeks, months, years, have all blended. To me they are no more, I simply exist. In love.

A small boat pulls onto my shore and a young man begins the short trek to my small cave like concrete room which contains very little. I have a small mat upon which I sleep. I have a thin cushion upon which I sit in meditation and where I spend most of my time, it is the center of my eight by eight cave. I have a small candle, a jug of fresh water, and a basket of bread and fruit which is replenished often. The young man approaches, he has a jug of water and some fresh fruit.

In his eyes, I can see that he has a question. I tell him to sit. I tell him to ask his question. He asks me if I can tell him the mystery and meaning of life. I can see that he is nervous and that he is anxious. I tell him to relax and to focus on the flickering of the flame upon the candle that is between us. I close my eyes and open my mind. This is a question asked by many, although the answer is the same, the meaning is different for each.

Young man, is it not said that I am in everything, and everything is in me? Is that not the mystery? Why then do you place psychological barriers to the truth? We are the collective. We are humankind. We are the whole, everything that forms the one. The mind is the father who gives us knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. The son which is the physical body is expected to take heed and obey the Father's mind out of love, through the heart and soul which cradles the spirit, which is the essence of the whole of creation. So to be here now is to experience the five senses as individuals who upon exiting this world return to the eternally infinite mind and present the joys, loves, pains, and feelings of life to be recorded, so as to be drawn upon and experienced at will, re-created. This, young man, is your mystery, your meaning, your answer to our question! Love is All, Love is Life, Love is Death, Love is Light, Love is Dark, therefore Love Is!! Go, young man spread the love! Festina Lente!! (hurry slowly)
