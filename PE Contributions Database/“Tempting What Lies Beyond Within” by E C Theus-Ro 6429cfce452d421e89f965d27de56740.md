**“Tempting What Lies Beyond Within” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

****It was the type of white that wasn’t quite right. Not robust enough to be branded white neither insubstantial enough not to provoke the echo. It seemed translucent and weightless. Yet as its powdery essence surrounded me, I could feel its urgency. It's reality crushing my very breath. I could touch it, but… but what good would that do? I could never grasp it. Let alone hold it as a lover. Will it tell me all its malignant truths? All the same I knew it well. More intimate than the gemini to its better half. Our acquaintance was no triste. Rather a recommencing of a long forestalled faithful affair. And now it would come soon, as it always did. Her withering caress. The fleeting glimpse of a paled silhouette. An uncontrolled moment of weakness. I reach for her expecting only space to ridicule my wasted sacrifice. For this is the normal course of things. To my name a whispered breath. My frozen heart shatters…

“Honey, honey, wake up.” Sam is shaking my shoulders. Her freckled, golden-tanned face and soft green eyes contort in anguish. Her words travel over and across the Atlantic to reach me. I’m still a hostage…

“Manolo, sweetie?” Sam’s voice softens. Painfully I’m wrenched free of my captors. Rescued from their chamber of turmoil. I blink one, two, as many as six times before I return to the land of the breathing. Sam’s eyes have deepened to almost an evergreen at the edge of winter. I must speak. I must say something. How selfish? How weak am I? Courage, you foul coward.

“It’s alright, Sammy.” I manage a grimace. My attempt at a reassuring smile. “Just a silly dream,” I lie.

“Was it… the fog…?”

She’s no fool. I close my eyes, feigning exhaustion. Our bed moves, her short buzzed hair kisses my shoulder, a hand over my traitorous heart. A trimmer runs through my body. Sam never reacted. She knew me, knew the truth, knew my fear.

“What if he never comes out of the fog? What will I do? Oh, God! Please not that,” Sam thought.
