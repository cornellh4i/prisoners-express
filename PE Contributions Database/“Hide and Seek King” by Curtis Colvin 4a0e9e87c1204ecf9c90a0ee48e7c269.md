**“Hide and Seek King” by Curtis Colvin**

Yes, that’s right. I’m the king of hide and seek, especially when I was a kid. I didn’t let anyone onto my street, and I would cover my eyes and “peek” through my hands to see where everyone was hiding. Then I would pick which friend I wanted to be “it” and go after them.

I don’t know how or when I developed this strange trait. All I know is that I didn’t know you could see me through my hands until I looked in the mirror while doing it. It scared the crap out of me!

Just think, while I was playing hide and seek, or covering my eyes while my sister’s friends got dressed in front of me, they could have really had looked and seen me looking. Thank God they didn’t!

Now I just do it in private, just for fun. I took this picture to prove to myself that I’m not crazy, and to let the world know the truth. With this cancer I have, I’m only here for a few more weeks. In the next life, maybe I won’t be the hide and seek King. Maybe I’ll be the “Red Rover” champ.
