**“Flying High Emotionally” by Joseph Alvin Parrish**

Well, today is October 27, 2019, and I am taking knowledge of the day of my soon release from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. I’m flying high emotionally. Hopefully, you can take it as good news that I will be leaving this place of discontent, any day now, but unfortunately those haters’ are laying in the cut looking for a reason to gloat over any misfortune. They are not getting out any time soon, and so why should they be happy for you soon departure? Being that I’m flying high emotionally, with happy expectations, I must be mindful to watch out for those haters.

“Real Talk”—You can just about tell who the haters are and who possibly will rejoice at your good fortune. It’s not very many, but there are some who can speak a good word on your behalf. I’m having to watch myself and be very careful because all it takes is one major disciplinary case and I can kiss my ticket to get out goodbye. I’m flying high emotionally. All my time is consumed with the big countdown. I should be leaving prison any time after October of 2019.

The only matter that’s deterring me is my health and medical bills. If I stay here and get the medical treatment that I need, then all my bills will be paid by the state; if I leave and go home, then I will have to pay all of the medical bills myself. I am a diabetic and insulin dependent. I have high blood pressure and HEP-C. I am in such a pitiful state. Doctor Jon Seley told me that I needed three stents placed in my heart cavity, but there has been a delay due to my uncontrolled blood pressure and high blood sugar, which I must first manage before the heart operation can proceed. I want to get it done but I am flying high emotionally to get out of this place. At this present moment, I am growing more and more impatient with each passing day. I’ve looked forward to this day for a whole eight years. My time has come and I am flying high emotionally.
