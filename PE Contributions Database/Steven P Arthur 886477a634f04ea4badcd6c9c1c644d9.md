Who doesn’t remember his first job? Not the chores done around the house, but that first, honest paycheck from a local business or company, payable to yours truly. For me, it was a paper work.

Since fifth grade, I began developing money management skills. The school implemented a savings account program sponsored by a local bank. During the program, I learned the value of money and saving it, and also the motivation for obtaining more. The next logical step was to find a job, but I was too young. When I finally reached the ripe old age of 12, I asked my parents what kind of job I could get. There weren’t many choices for a kid that didn’t have armpit hair yet, but we contacted the local newspaper who informed me that I could have a paper route with my parents’ consent. In fact, the man who had the paper route was just one street over from mine was planning on quitting soon. I was excited because not only would I have a cool job that paid money, but all my friends could see me riding around and throwing newspapers like the “Paperboy” game.

After a short training period, I was all on my own. The papers would be waiting in a nice bundle on my driveway when I got home from school. I can still remember the smell of fresh, just-off-the-press newspapers and that very distinct ink smell. I took them in to roll them into tight, throw-worthy paper sticks bounded with an ugly green rubber band. I packed them into neat rows like cord wood, and after I strapped the bag to my BMX with one bag hanging off each of the handle bars, I was off to deliver.

At the time, it seemed like I spent all day rolling, packing, and riding around throwing papers, but as I recall, I don’t think I had more than 70 subscribers at any given time. When I was finally done and haven’t been attacked by the roaming neighborhood dogs or nearly hit by the working class rushing home, I’d wash my hands of the blank ink. Like an auto mechanic, it seemed I could never get the black out from underneath my nails.

The job didn’t pay more than $60 in a single month, but at the end of the month, when I collected money for the newspaper subscriptions, I knew it was time for me to burn a little money. Every month, I spent money on two or three of the latest Nintendo games. I don’t remember ever spending it on much else.

I didn’t have the job for long. My parents got a divorce soon after I started the job, and between that and the onslaught of hormones, I lost interest in working. That loss of interest was rekindled at 15 when I realized I could trade my bike for a car. I discovered the joys of fast food work and girls, but that’s a story for another time.
