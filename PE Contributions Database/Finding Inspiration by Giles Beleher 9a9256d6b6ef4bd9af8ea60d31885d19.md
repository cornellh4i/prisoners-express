**Finding Inspiration by Giles Beleher**

Sometimes it’s hard to find inspiration. There are days it’s hard to be inspired by negative people, atmosphere, and a biased view of life here in SCDC. People bad mouthing each other, hateful attitudes, and general mistrust make life hard. But God sees and knows everything. That’s to be remembered.

Finding inspiration is writing. These essays, flash memoirs, and journaling have greatly helped me! Also, getting letters of encouragement, feedback, and questions everyone has asked changes my outlook! I didn’t get much mail, but since Prisoner Express and the CWI program at BRCI greatly influences me to write.You there on the outside in life are an inspiration to me here in prison! There is hope and peace to come I believe.

The structure of SCDC is to tear down, block, hinder, and stifle inspiration, hope, and life in general. Negative, b.s., attitudes of staff and admin make finding inspiration hard. No truth, help, or care is mostly not seen or heard in SCDC. Especially here at KCI, a level 2 that was once a level 3. It’s been a dumping ground for SCDC. The last couple of years, I’ve been here 1 year and 6 months at a hellhole for the most part. But there’s good here in some people trying to change. I’m in a class where I’m rebuilding furniture. It’s a challenge, but what isn’t a challenge in life? This is a vocational trade that’s tough, but rewarding. Mr. Gill, the instructor, is an inspiration. His many years of experience helps to inspire me when I’ve fallen short. What’s inspiring you?
