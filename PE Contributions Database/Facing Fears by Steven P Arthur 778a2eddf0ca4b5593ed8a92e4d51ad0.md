**by Steven P. Arthur**

My whole life was coming to a halt: I was going to jail. Worse still, I was going to prison. The realization that my life would not, could not, ever be the same was eclipsed only be the thought of a now unknown future. The ratcheting of handcuffs was louder than I had ever imagined. As cold steel tightened around my wrists, impressing deep grooves into my skin and cutting off proper circulation, a lifetime of prison images from news and movies flooded my mind. Isolation, boredom, gang rape in the showers, murder, suicide. Those words didn’t just come to mind: they dropped into my consciousness like atomic weapons. The words were tangible and crushing. Would I be a victim, beaten or stabbed to death, while an indifferent prison guard watched? Or would I have to join a gang and victimize others in order to survive? Never again would I feel the love of a woman, physically or emotionally. Would I become gay to feel love again? Could I?

Now, many years later, I sit here in prison writing this. The news and movies don’t necessarily have the prison image wrong, but the portrayals are a more condensed version of nefarious and dangerous events that inmates encounter. Those fears have faded but will forever be alloyed with all the other experiences since that moment, to form the new man that I am today. A comparable life event would be a near death experience because essentially, you have died. What you were is gone, only very few aspects of your previous life remain. Most, if not all of your friends and family, will have abandoned you, as if incarceration is a communicable disease. For most, prison is a catharsis and rebirth.

Today, I find the future is still unknown to me, but I have faced a living death. And now I’m truly ready to live.
