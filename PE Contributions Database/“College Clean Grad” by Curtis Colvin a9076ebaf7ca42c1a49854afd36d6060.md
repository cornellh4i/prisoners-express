**“College Clean Grad” by Curtis Colvin**

Between 1981 and 1991, I was deeply into drugs. I had graduated high school, went into the Navy, got out, got married, and after 8 years, divorced. And all the while, I tried different drugs: pot, sherm, mushrooms, acid, inhaling refrigerant, crack, coke, hash, and opium. The only thing I didn’t do was shoot up. I hated needles!	Once I hit a bottom, I went into rehab. My clean date is 9-19-91. I’m still clean today because I finally had enough. So after a year of sobriety, I was working as a foreman for a scaffold building company in DuPont Plant in Orange, Texas when my supervisor said he needed to lay off 9 guys and asked me to pick them. I asked if I could be one of them so I could go back to college. I could collect unemployment for the first 6 months in college if I was laid off. He agreed.

I took that leap of faith because I believed I could better myself being clean and sober. The Texas Rehabilitation Commission helped me with my tuition, books, and uniforms. SInce I was a recovering addict, I had that privilege. I ended up graduating Lamar University in Port Arthur, Texas with my Licensed Vocational Nursing degree. I wasn’t afraid of needles anymore, especially since I was the one who’s sticking! I just wished I would have given the Lord more recognition for His part in my success. For pride comes before a fall, and boy, did I fall. Twenty years in here and counting.
