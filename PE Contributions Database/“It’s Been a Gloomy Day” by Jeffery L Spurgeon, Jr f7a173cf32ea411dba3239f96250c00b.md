**“It’s Been a Gloomy Day” by Jeffery L. Spurgeon, Jr.**

Does it seem like everything in your life is going wrong! Do you feel like God hates you, or you have the worst luck in the world! Does it feel like you’re in hell right now! I can relate. Maybe you feel cursed and that because of your past you don’t deserve good and that’s why you’re suffering. Well, that’s just not true.

Most of our situations right now are just the reactions to our actions. If you dump a glass of water, something is bound to get wet. There are four seasons (winter, spring, summer, and fall) that we can learn from. Nature, weather, even flowers are something we can look at for bad luck. Kids don’t let the bad weather ruin their day, they go outside and play in it. That’s exactly the spirit we should have.

The four seasons bring a series of different weather, each one either warming us up or cooling us down. It sprinkles, it rains, it pours, either one could cause you to be thankful for the coolness it brings or mad because it ruins a hot date. It all depends on who you are, where you are, and your plans for the day.

Okay, you’re having a bad day. It feels like this storm is going on forever, and you can’t stand it any longer. Down here in Florida we have hurricanes that last for longer than a week sometimes. They come in with a strong force that tear cities apart. Some people cry over the disaster, but others get out there and see the chance for healing, a new start. The ending could be the beginning to something beautiful.

How can a hurricane bring healing? Well, after a week of nasty weather you will be so grateful for the sunshine. And you don’t see much behind the scenes because the media only likes to broadcast the worst of everything. Communities come together and help restore. Americans come from all over to show their love, generosity, and support. Skin color, racism, hatred and anger go out the window when we need each other.

Families who haven’t seen each other for years might now depend on each other. Some people learn about life and find who they are. It’s all about perspective. Many find that spirit of a little kid who goes out and plays in the rain or snow. When I was a kid my friends and I loved to get out there and see the adventure in the eye of the storm.

Here in Florida, storms are followed by sunshine. Sometimes we have to go through a bad day to remind us what a good day looks like. That way we can learn to appreciate it. Don’t overlook your good days because tomorrow you might be wishing you can wake up from a bad dream.

Bad days bring good days and really bad days bring really good days. It takes a rainy day to water a field of wildflowers. Once it’s over, they bloom, and bring beauty to the world. Fog can blind us from what’s in front of us, but once it’s gone, we can see the beauty in front of us and appreciate it.

I’ve been in prison for thirteen years now and before this I didn’t appreciate anything. I cheated on all my girlfriends. I spent all my money on drugs, alcohol, clothes, and shoes. And I forgot my family even existed. Prison has taught me to appreciate so much.

I was inspired to write this tonight in solitary confinement as the officer passing out mailshot passed my door for the fourth night straight. If you’re anything like me, mail means a lot. I’ve been in solitary for thirty-eight days now for something I didn’t do. All in the same day that I was placed in solitary I lost my phone calls, canteen privileges, and visits for a year for possession of a cell phone- something I didn’t do. It all came down on me at once.

I’m also fighting for clemency so I can get out of prison, and for the last thirteen years motions and appeals have been denied. My release date says May of 2040, but I’m not going to let it keep me in out of the storm. “Hell no.” I’m gonna have the spirit of a kid and get out in the midst of it.

God doesn’t hate you or me. If anything the devil hates us because of our good, and wants to tear us down. We don’t have bad luck either, we just don’t see the outcome and the beauty of our current situation. Don’t make circumstances worse by getting depressed or angry. It’s not going to do anything except dig you a deeper hole.

A beautiful sunny day is to follow, so if you’re one of these people having a really bad day, prepare yourself, because something really good is about to happen for you. The sun is about to shine, or the rain is about to cool off a really hot one.
