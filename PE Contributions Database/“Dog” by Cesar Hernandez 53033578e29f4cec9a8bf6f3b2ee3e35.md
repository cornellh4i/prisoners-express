**“Dog” by Cesar Hernandez**

When everything is going well, it is easy to be happy. The moment something difficult happens, it’s not so easy. You tend to find yourself saying,

“I didn’t know this was going to happen. I didn’t think I’d miss my flight. I didn’t think Ann would show up at the party wearing the same dress that I had on. I didn’t think that somebody would dent my brand new car one hour after I got it.” Are you really willing to break your vow of happiness because these events took place?

Billions of things could happen that you haven’t thought of yet. The question is not whether they will happen. Things are going to happen.The real question is whether you want to be happy regardless of what happens. The purpose of your life is to enjoy and learn from your experiences. You were not put on Earth to suffer. You’re not helping anybody by being miserable. Regardless of your philosophical beliefs, the fact remains that you were born, and you’re going to die. During the time in between, you get to choose whether or not you want to enjoy the experiences. Events do not determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. They’re just events. *You* determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things to happen to you, and then be happy to die.
