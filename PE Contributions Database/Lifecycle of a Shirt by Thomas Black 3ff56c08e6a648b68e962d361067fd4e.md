**Lifecycle of a Shirt by Thomas Black**

Quite a few years ago, I went to a local store, shopping for work shirts. In the men’s department I found a rack of nice Western style shirts, nice colors, decent prints. And a bonus, the sleeves were already cut off and nicely hemmed.

In my world, this is a win-win situation. I don’t have to cut the sleeves myself, and I’m not paying for material I won’t use, and the nice hem meant they’d last longer.

I picked out five or six. All went straight to the work shirt wardrobe, except one, a white cotton shirt with thin red stripes and medium block size. It went to the special occasion wardrobe. By special occasion I mean any event not considered a formal affair. It was perfect for going to the juke, beer joint, all you can eat catfish night at the cafe, and dates.

I wore it on one very special date. I asked a lovely lady from work out (back when it was still socially acceptable to date someone whom you worked with). I invited her to the social event of the year in Southern Arkansas County. The Arkansas County Fair Demolition Derby! It doesn’t get much bigger than that! It worked out and we eventually got married. But back to the shirt.

It maintained its place of honor for quite some time, still in use for going out on special occasions. Then it was relegated to the work shirt wardrobe. It endured for a while in this role, but eventually time and wear began to show.

It was relegated to the yard shirt pile, suitable for scrapping metal, yard work and automobile repair. I still maintained a reverence for my shirt. We’d had so many good memories.

After so many years of service it was getting thin. So it was demoted to the pile reserved for fish cleaning clothes. Part of my living is earned by commercial fishing. The processing of fish is a dirty, bloody, smelly activity, so for shirts and pants it’s the last leg. The clothes ain’t allowed inside. After a wash they’re hung on the back porch to air.

I was still very fond of my shirt. I actually saved it from the trash can three times when my wife tried to discard it. I’m not one to give up on a garment, especially one with such fond memories.

But the day came when it was time to admit the shirt’s time was done. While at the fish house I snagged it on a nail, ripped a large gash across the back. And it was very thin after so much wear and bleach. It was a painful choice, but it had to be done.

I took it home, called my wife and let her watch me throw it in the trash. She had a good laugh, me not so much. It was sorta like losing a good friend.
