“Make A Little Heaven” by Cambren Thomas

The lives that we choose to live… There are so many variables that can sway our paths progressively closer to a fiery inferno of ceaseless suffering. Take my life for example. Just a few years ago, I was happily laboring toward a reputable and interminable marriage. I also had two beautiful daughters, a nice place, a savings stash, a new car. I worked as a freelance video-editor for a local advertising company, and I had a self-produced online cooking show that was steadily gaining notoriety and currency. Nonetheless, all of these possessions and people have become figments of my past part of a life — part of a life I will never be able to live again.

Ya know I never had even the slightest inkling that I would be where I am now. But, due to my own selfish, irrational, and impassioned choices, I am now a numbered piece of state property. Even still, what makes it all more calamitous, is the fact that I am a fairly intellectual individual within an environment that is mindless, careless, deprived, and animalistic. I can’t say that I have ever been to hell, but this place, this prison “hell hole” that I am presently confined within, has to have unmistakably common characteristics. Still, the surface level aggravations of this environment pale in comparison to the deeper, more soul-striking aspects of this place — *they* have truly done the most damage to me.

Prison living is like being tossed in a crock-pot, set to simmer; meaning I have nothing but time to sit and stew in bygone memories. It is absolute torture, and far more cumbersome a load than the average person can handle. I still relive my crime daily… the unhinged spirit, the red-hot rage, the instant remorse and sorrow, and the unraveling of so many lives — all because of me. I still have lucid inescapable dreams of being “out there” too — seeing oceans, feeling actual carpet underneath my feet, smelling my ex-wife’s favorite body spray, hearing my daughter singing songs, etc. Then, quite naturally, I wake up to a stainless steel window, a rusty bunk, drably painted walls, and the sliding mechanical grind of my cell door opening.

Honestly, it is so hard not to just decline into the depths of depression on at times. Still I know that my survival within these walls is only measured by the potency if my renewed and unwavering faith. I literally thank God every single day, for He has blessed me with a strength that I never knew I had — the strength to make the best of a dire situation. I am eternally grateful for this ability to endure. God’s forgiveness and guidance have taken my numerous outlets with which to exorcise my lingering inner angst.

My burgeoning passion for writing, for instance, has been paramount in transforming my life God has given me a pen and paper and a wealth of wordy whimsy to express and channel my experiences, thoughts, and observations into something creative, unique, and potentially powerful. Even more so, I have been blessed with a sincere appreciation for the simplicities that this life permits; and I thank God for actually slowing me down enough to delight in the more minute details of His magnificent creation. I actually take the time to look at cloud formations now, or the multihued skyward arcs of a rainbow, or a sunrise or a sunset, or a cow chomping grass out in the distance; even watching a spider build a web hlds my attention now. I observe so much more, and receptively evoke facets of my life that I once took for granted.

Am I complacent? No.

Is every day a clear path to victory? No.

Do I feel lonely at times? Yes.

Do I miss my family? Of course!

Nevertheless, I have found my wings without the Red Bull — found a way to say afloat within a torrent of misery I have obtained a more driven attitude that I humbly hope will be used by God to encourage others. I am still going to persist to exist, and continue to positively exercise my mind, body, and spirit… with or without the people that I love around me, adn with the almost two decades of time that I still might have to give to this state. I will forever aspire to embody a hopeful spirit that I pray will continue to shine brightly within this razor-wired empire of darkness.
