***Loner* by Darrell Ballard**

The cool winter wind blows softly through the thick fur of the lone wolf. Slowly the wolf made his way through the dead woods marking his vast territory with his well known scent. A daily ritual that has become more of an unconscious action than voluntary.

There was no happiness left inside the lone wolf. Mainly due to the fact that over the years of the wolf’s life the human race had hunted down and killed every wolf they could find. Now it’s to the point that this wolf was the last of his kind.

Now he only knows the instincts that keep him alive but he knew that death would be around every corner. What the wolf did not know was of the fictitious persona that man has created of wolves in their stories. Stories like, Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs.

What the wolf really didn’t know was of the Human Race’s need to be superior to everything and everyone. This need for superiority has now left the wolf living his life outside the realm of normality…

A life as a loner.
