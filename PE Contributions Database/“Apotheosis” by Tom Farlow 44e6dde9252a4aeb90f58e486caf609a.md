**“Apotheosis” by Tom Farlow**

It would be the sounds of frogs croaking and fish breaking the water’s tranquil surface that he remembered most about that day of pain, joy, anger and release. What better way than to have it end here? What better way to find a new beginning?

It was here at the docks that the happiest memories remained more vividly alive in his brain. This serene retreat from the animated state of modern-world trappings was the one key cherishment he caressed in the back of his mind like a favorite pet. He could almost feel the kitten-like purr as he did so.

Here at the docks: no cell phone, no computer, none of the leashes of technology that looped around each of us-- driving home the incessant need to face a screen in the magical hopes of some “urgent” update appearing before our eyes, releasing endorphins of instant chemical happiness of vapidity into the psyche of our social contrivance.

Here at the docks drifted past episodes of swim lessons as he released his hold on pillars piercing the cool waters; experiencing again the patience of fishing from the east end while fish grew fat off stolen bait before he caught one watching with his mind’s eye the beautifully transcendent vista the distant hills provided if looked upon at just the perfect moment as he did now-- the reds he so adored just beginning to envelope the greens covering the mounds of earth as the sun’s rays stoked their flames from high above, through clouds, permeating the atmosphere as a brilliant end to each day only to rise and start a new tomorrow.

The joy wrapped around the dock contrasted sharply to the agony he attributed to the house behind him. There, an oppressive atmosphere had filled its walls to the brim with a hodgepodge of intimidation, belittlement and unremitting anger that assaulted the senses the moment one crossed the threshold into its hallowed halls, even if HE wasn’t inside. The mere turning of thoughts to those tragedies endured released the floodgates, drowning him in a torrent of angst that in the past could torment his soul into fitful states of sweat-soaked, catatonic panic attacks, debilitating him into capitulation. No more.

In the House of Horror, his totalitarian tormentor religiously reigned in pernicious power over his licentious life and its oppressive objectives exercising an advantage over him he had not been bequeathed-- oh, how that would now change. Here is where numerous scars had built up, one atop another with each repetitious reinforcement of how to stand, how to talk, how to eat, how to sit, how to write, how to read, how to dress, and how he was expected to think. No more.

Here is where the meticulous molding of his life had been chartered by hands not of his own. The repeated raps of wooden rulers over knuckles as he messed up an oral exam were only outdone by the loud wacks of hard leather across his soon-to-be-welted flesh of his back bared to the room in order to impress the need to be better so this path of punishment and future humiliation could be avoided. This house would be the battlegrounds for both the war waged over his soul and the final fight for the right to become who he really wanted to be. No more.

No more.

No more would there be any opportunity for THEM to demean and denounce his attempts of creativity. No more would THEY, or anyone else, curb his desire to decorate his existence how he saw fit. No more would a tyrant tower over his potential, constraining him within a box of conformity dictated by restrictive, subjective, social standards from a time long since passed, pass to the new horizons before him.

As he looked up, a firefly floated down into the ripples of the waves lapping gently over his extended legs. The life of the thing extinguished by a saturation unable to sustain the alien life form intruding into its domain. The droplet that fell upon the floating, blacked the carcass surprised him. He has not realized how releasing today truly was. As his tear melted into the crystal waters beneath, sobs wracked his body with therapeutic convulsions, forcing more tears to fuse with the blue-green liquid now littered with countless fireflies bespeckling a surface new black from their kamikaze dives.

He turned to watch their nest, marveling at the sheer numbers that had spawned at such a rapid pace. The wind-carried, red-tiled flakes rained over him, mingling with his hair and alighting even upon his long eyelashes. His hand rose to wipe his vision, clear, but they too were covered in soot.

The once expansive Mansion of Misery that was the place of his imprisonment and sought to oppress him into obscurity now instead cowered amidst flames licking the very life from her timbers. As the embers carried upward from the spewing smoke and dispersed into swarms to spread word of this pivotal moment in history, laughter replaced the sobs, for a realization had dawned: he was a phoenix reborn from these soon-to-be smoldering ashes, no longer restrained from his artistic, altruistic design to bring fireflies to those he had been prevented to before. Now he would show them all of his real potential...
