**“The Making of a Supervillain” by Jevon Jackson**

She hated herself for dwelling on how things ended between them. Vicky had loved him more than anything or anyone else in her entire lifetime, and every day during her lunch break, for the past two months, she sat in the empty conference room window at work, waiting to catch a glimpse of him flying through the city on his souped-up hoverboard. The hoverboard that she helped design. The more Vicky thought about it, the more she realized that everything he had and everything he had become was because of her.

Before he met her, he was just some low-level vigilante that people were afraid of. Vicky showed him how to overhaul his image so the public would embrace him and feel like they needed him to be their hero. She was the one who showed him how to use his powers more effectively and in a much more humane way. She was the one who had given him the superhero name that all of Central City now loved and adored -- Black Fusion.

Just a year and a half ago, the Central City Tribune had pegged him as “the melding man” -- a troubled vigilante stalking the streets at night dishing out extreme versions of justice. Then there was the Christmas Even incident that brought everything to a boil.

A group of high school kids had broken into a pharmacy after it closed on Christmas Eve. The vigilante, wearing jeans, a black hoodie, and dark sunglasses, confronted the three teens on their way out of the shattered glass door of the pharmacy. One kid quickly pulled out a gun and pointed it at the vigilante’s head. In the same motion, the vigilante held out his right arm, aimed his open palm at the kid with the gun, and from the vigilante’s palm a flash of blue light burst out towards the fun. Instantaneously, the gun melted into the kid’s hand. It looked like a blob of pale flesh, white bone, and black gunmetal. Toting duffle bags, the other two teens saw this and quickly ran away. The vigilante aimed his open palm towards them; another bright burst of blue light shot out towards their legs. They both fell immediately; one teen’s left ankle had been fused to the other teen’s right ankle, bone to bone.

When the CCPD (Central City Police Department) arrived on the scene minutes later, they found all three of the teens writhing in agony in front of the pharmacy, with two duffle bags full of stolen pills and a video of the entire incident, apparently taken by the vigilante, uploaded to the CCPD website. This was the incident that compelled the CCPD and the local district attorney to issue a warrant for the arrest of the vigilante. The kid with the gun melted into his hand, this was the mayor’s son, and he had to have his entire right hand amputated. The other two teens had to endure major surgery to have the bones in their ankles separated from each other. The criminals became the victims. The public wanted the vigilante to be held accountable.

Vicky, working for her grandfather’s law firm, saw how she could fix the situation for everyone involved. She took the initiative to track down the vigilante, which was difficult within itself, and over the course of a few weeks, was able to win his trust. She worked out a deal with Steven, the vigilante’s real name. He would now work with the CCPD, and only have to pay restitution for the three teens’ medical bills.

Vicky provided him with an entirely new makeover: a sleek, new black, bulletproof, lightweight superhero suit, a state-of-the-art hoverboard, and a formidable name -- Black Fusion. After thwarting a coordinated 12-man terrorist plot against thousands of citizens, Black Fusion became the golden boy of Central City and an international celebrity.

As much as she tried to keep things between them purely professional, and as many times as she deflected Steven’s attempts to ask her out on a date, eventually Vicky couldn’t deny the chemistry between them. Within the span of a year, Steven and Vicky had become the embodiment of passion, love, and lust. To Vicky, it felt like they had become each other’s world, and nothing nor anyone could interfere with that.

And then Steven (as Black Fusion) met Stacy Catcher -- the gorgeous, green-eyed news anchor from one of the major morning news shows. Steven had gotten caught up in his celebrity so much that it caused Vicky and him to fight and argue constantly. After Steven, in full superhero mode, was photographed kissing Stacy Catcher on his hoverboard, it was over between him and Vicky.

As she stared out of the big conference room window, Vicky daydreamed and reminisced until the very thought of him sickened her. She thought and she plotted. He was nothing without her. She made him into what he was. And if she chose so she could rightfully undo him. She knew his strengths and contemplated his weaknesses. Black Fusion was a product made from her own imagination. And she could make something more powerful, something more worthy of her own name.

She thought and she plotted. Soon, Central City would be hers.
