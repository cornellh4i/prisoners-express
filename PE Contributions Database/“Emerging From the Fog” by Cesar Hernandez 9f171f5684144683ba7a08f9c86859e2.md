**“Emerging From the Fog” by Cesar Hernandez**

My wife had dragged me to a wedding I did not want to attend. I had to get my payback somehow. My wife does not really like horror things. For halloween season I decided I would drag her to haunted houses.

We went to this haunted house theme park about a two hour drive away. This place has about ten different haunted houses. The parking lot was simply a grass field. I’m almost certain they charged for parking. At the entrance you buy tickets. You can also buy a wristband to skip lines. I bought the wristbands since I hate lines! I think I spent one hundred dollars before even stepping foot inside.

There are several haunted houses. A clown house, a castle, chain link fence, mirror house, and others. There’s lots of fog everywhere so you can’t see well and don’t know what will pop out at you. I put my wife in front of me so she would get scared. I also put ear plugs in my ears so I wouldn’t be startled. It was great having the wristbands so we didn’t have to stand in line with the commoners. I remember at the castle the line was at least two hundred people. We got in in less that five minutes. You could see the people in line were jealous of the wristband holders. All they had to do was spend an additional twenty five dollars to skip lines. They chose not to.

At this theme park they also sell all kinds of food and beer. My wife asked me if I got my payback. I say not so fast. Wait until tomorrow.

The next night we go to another haunted house at this old meat packing plant. Supposedly the place is haunted from all the people who died there. I think tickets are about forty dollars each. Again I put my wife in front of me so she’ll get scared. There’s lots of fog and it is very dark. The whole run through takes about ninety minutes. Near the end they chase you with chainsaws. The very last thing is a tunnel with lots of soap bubbles. You come out completely covered in soap suds. My wife asks if I got my payback. I say wait until tomorrow.

The following night we go to a third and final haunted house. It is three haunted houses in one. I think tickets were only twenty five dollars. This place was not very scary and not very good. It took less than forty five minutes to go through it. I tell my wife I finally got my payback. She says that’s good since we’re not ever going to any more haunted houses.
