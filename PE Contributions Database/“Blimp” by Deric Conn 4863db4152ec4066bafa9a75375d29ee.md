**“Blimp” by Deric Conn**

It seems like an ordinary day for an ordinary zeppelin to cruise the afternoon sky. But what seems ordinary will soon turn into chaos as a meteor smashes into zeppelin with grave impact.

What once traveled the clear blue sky, now falls to earth with a great crash. Fire and debris send a message that destruction has occurred. Soon people will amass to witness the scene as news crews will race to be the first to report this local tragedy.

Police, ambulances and fire trucks will arrive to perform heroic duties; though sadly, no one could survive what has just occurred.

The excitement of it all will fade out as fast as it happened. And life, as always, will go on. But for the moment, death and destruction has the spotlight. All of this on what seemed like an ordinary day.
