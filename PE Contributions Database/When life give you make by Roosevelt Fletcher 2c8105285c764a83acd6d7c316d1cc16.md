What makes no sense at all is to contend you’re alone in a crowded room! Yet, should the mere presence of others present present an individual with companionship?

Broadcasting live form the box where the doors stay locked for more than 23 r1 B.K.A SHU to some, the dun~hun (sort for dungeoun) seg,do hole r hell to many..yet me..It’s just another part of the jail, where the cells are exactly the same in the state of misery (Missouri). Does that make any sense? Brain..( wasn’t that inspector gadgets dogs name?!!).

Make sense of this then..why a nigga (term very loose to mean ‘person in general’) would ask damn near every person who pass their cage door “What tie is it” as if he has anyhwere to be or anything cominf (3) hot meals and a mad pass m-f..yet several times a day I’ll hear the guard yell “1:25 pm” only to asked “What time is it again (5) cells down, while it’s still 1:25pm!! But… the funniest art is to hear it turn 1:26 pm...even funnier, then minutes later someone’ll yell to the cell who got the view of the clock “what time is it!!!

We.. (now when I say “we” I speak of the masses, not necessarily “me”) kick a steel door with the heel of our feet for however long it takes for one of two things… one, the police comes to see what you want.. Two, the police to come and spray you for kicking on the doors… all for what? Let’s see.. Turn on my light, turn it off.. Depending on which one of these I speak of, it may be on at one kicking and off at the next one (20) minutes later…oh, and if you wonder “did he ask the time”... yeah, he’s one of em… we kick when we don’t get an iten on our tray, when the meal is late, when we feel it’s time for: rec, showers or phone calls to begin… what makes even less sense is that the police respects that shit and folds every time… well, until a black (n-word) gets to kicking, 8 times outta ten,he’ll get a fat dose of O.C pepper spray and in 2019, it’s so chemically warfared (gangsta), it will cease and desist, all kicking (from the blacks) the whites kick too… don’t get me wrong. They get sprayed too about 20% of the time!! Yet, it’s a place run by 100% white guards, it’s a macho thing and sends an unspoken message “whites are fearless and blacks are easy to shake off their square”...makes sense.. If you believe hype!!

Violence makes all the sense in the world, yet must I get my brains beat in to get it? Well.. yeah, since we don’t seem to “get it”!! Hand caught in the cookie jar of a child, pop across the butt… dog craps on the oriental rug, pop on the hand with a newspaper… kick ya door, assault with 10 UOD bTU peppers in a can… woman mouth off, fist to the face, man caught cheating, pot full of grits’ll get em in lin. I’m not talking on a plate!!

As retardded as this episode has been, does it make any sense? If.. ehye… ohn-lee.. Hhaddaa.. broin!
