**“Here I Am” by Derek LeCompte**

I’ve recently strived to join the Prisoner Express family as we all have one great thing in common: expressing ourselves in a constructive way. Before then, my entire life seemed to be engulfed by the fog of grief. Mind you, it’s been a long time living in that fog as I am 38 years old and I just passed having 19 years incarcerated. Then, as I said, I find what I believe is the answer to my prayers when I find the information for Prisoner Express. It’s amazing. The fog has started to dissipate.

Sharing my writing and poetry is my greatest form of therapy, but also reading others’, as well. It’s so funny, I saw a couple writings by Catherine LaFleur, and at first I said to myself, “Huh! There’s someone with a name as French as mine.” That’s what caught my eye at first. Strange, isn’t it? Then I started reading her essay “How Not to Burn” and something touched me, and more fog disappeared. I was amazed.

We come from completely different backgrounds, but we seem to have the same mindset. That’s inspiring to call others out of our fog, too.

I come from a strictly Agnostic background. Yet, as I was engulfed in the darkness, I was forbidden to talk about it. The mental, physical and spiritual abuse I endured at the hands of my parents or their boyfriends or girlfriends was simply swept under the carpet to be walked upon until it no longer existed. What they didn’t know was it always existed in my feeling worthless and hopeless which manifested when I chose writing as my sanctuary. I did well for some time until I was completely abandoned by all of my family and forced to go on my own. Also, during the brief time I actually stopped writing, my crime occurred and I’ve been in prison since. That was not long after my 19th birthday.

Since that day, my life has done a complete 180 degree turn. I’ve found my worth, my hope, in prion. Within two months of landing in New Jersey State Prison, what they call “The Last Stop” (because more than 70% of the population will never be released), I got my high school diploma, was nominated valedictorian of my graduating class, and became a Teacher’s Aid, all at 20 years old.

That allowed me to incorporate education, along with my writing, as my sanctuary. I have never felt better and I’ve taken pretty much all of the programs NJDOC offers: Focus on the Victim, SEALL (Successful Employment And Lawful Living), Cage Your Rage, Thinking 4 A Change, Workforce Learning Link, Stock Market Game Worldwide (4 times), and several correspondence courses from Criminon New York (The Way to Happiness, Conditions of Life, Personal Integrity), American Bible Academy, Set-Free Prison Ministries (15 of them), EMMAUS (15 of them), and others.

But, it wasn’t until I encountered Helen and Maureen of Houses of Healing. I don’t know if you have this course at your prison- but take it! I truly love this course, and I genuinely love Helen and Maureen for what they’ve shown me. They don’t see the superficial you, they see the Core You! It’s beautiful. After that, I found College Guild ([www.collegeguild.org](http://www.collegeguild.org/)) and it is amazing. I’ve taken their creative language course and Poetry Club 1 and 2, I’m working on Poetry Club 3, too. Their staff is incredible: Julie, Beth, Bekah and all the others. I owe them so much.

These were all my shields against my fog returning and being able to endure the systematic dehumanization that being in prison succumbs you to. Unlike dear Catherine LaFleur, we have no nature here. In Southwoods State Prison, you don’t even have the chance to step in grass. It’s a void that hurts a person like me who loves nature.

Even with that, I feel no loneliness. I have the company of angels- all of you. Sure, we do not speak face to face, but you know me, I can know you… the true you… the true me. We spend time every time we write and read. Now, I am participating in the Build a Book Program. Wow, I truly appreciate that program, and Maia for sharing her expertise. Also, thank you Jennifer for being another reader of my poetry. Thank you all- every single one of you! Fog… gone.
