**"Woman in Black" by Anonymous**

I believe that life is a pilgrimage and that we all on our journey must pass through the valley of the shadow of death. It is a rite of passage to the promised land. We people intersect from different lands and cultures, get speak the universal language of vulnerability. Help, I think, is the most transcendental word known to the seal of another anonymous, the conversation between them becomes divine. Ethereal.

I see myself there; wounded, hurting, in need of someone. Anyone. Help me. Salvation has a heartbeat like my own. Only stronger. I can feel it’s pulse rattling my bones, rallying me to fight on. “Who are you? How did you find me? Are you hurt too?” Stay with me, please. Hold me. I fear. I… blackout.
