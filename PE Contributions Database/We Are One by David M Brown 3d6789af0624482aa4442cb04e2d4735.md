**We Are One by David M Brown**

I was just wondering along and sensed something so I stopped. I looked around and didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary; so I closed my eyes, relaxed, and smelled the air. I opened my eyes and something stood out that hadn’t before. Some sort of flower-like plant that was glowing radiantly. It’s as if I felt a gravitational pull pulling me toward it. Each step I took in it’s direction the pull got stronger  and stronger. It seemed like the closer I got the more it leaned toward me. I felt compelled to put my face as close as possible to it. Before I knew it we were talking to each other. Not with verbal language, but in a language that we both understood.

I said “I’m looking at you”

It said “I’m looking back”

I said “I sense your energy”

It said “We feel each other”

I said “I am part of the past and future”

It said “As well as I-I am you and you are me. We are both part of life, and not only that. We are both a part of the whole.”
