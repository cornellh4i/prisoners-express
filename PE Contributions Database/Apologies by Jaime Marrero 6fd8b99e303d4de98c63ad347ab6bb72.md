**“Apologies” by Jaime Marrero**

As an incarcerated inmate, I have discovered that I apologize a lot, and no matter how many times I am forgiven, I know that I will apologize again. Every time that I receive a letter, or an email, or I make a phone call and I hear about a hardship that my family may encounter, my guilt from being “locked up” tears at me all over again. I know that everything is not my fault, but I can’t help but wonder that if I had been there, would things have been different?

For me, the most devastating reality that I have to live with is my abandonment of my son. He was five years old when I was incarcerated. His mother is not in his life by her own choice. My mom was taking care of him until she passed away when he was six years old - not even a year after my incarceration. He then went to stay with my brother in South Carolina, Unfortunately, this was a bad time for my brother here in South Carolina because he and his wife were having problems of their own. They have not been able to have a child of their own, so the stress was causing them to lash out at my son. Well, once again, I had to move my son to live with my oldest brother in North Carolina. After about eight years of living with my oldest brother, my son once again lost someone that he loved. My brother had a severe heart attack and died. This has caused my son to resent me. My son is soon to be eighteen years old and he has been on his own for two years now - well, he is living with my nephew but he’s always working so basically, he is on his own.

As an incarcerated father, I am limite severely on what I can do for my son. I don’t make money except for thirty dollars every two weeks. Some inmates don’t even get a chance to earn that! I write to him and I try to push him and encourage him through letters. This is all I can do from here. Every waking moment that I have, my wounds tear back open with every thought of him. I can remember, as a teenager, that I always wanted to be a good dad. My dad is a good man but he wasn’t there for me when I needed guidance. So I wanted to be a better dad than my own - a present dad, and not an absent one. With every unanswered letter that I send, I hope that I will get a return, and we will start building a relationship. Until then though, with every letter that I send him, I will always tell him. “My dearest son, I am sorry for the hardship that I have put you through. Please do not let this hinder your endeavors in life. I was a young fool, but I have always loved you!”
