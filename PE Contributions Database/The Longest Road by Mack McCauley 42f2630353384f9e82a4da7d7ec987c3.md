**The Longest Road by Mack McCuley**

My footsteps fell wearily, one after the other. My head was heavy with the thoughts of how far I had already traveled and of how far I had yet to go. My gaze lifts from the cracked desolate, ever-stretching asphalt laid out before me, asphalt that reaches onward unendingly. Onward towards the beacon of hope that is the mountains on the never nearing horizon. The mountains. The illusionary goal we all strive for and at times race towards. A seemingly set destination in the distance. Destination, what a word. A derivation of the word destiny, which is like the mountains ahead- something that always seems to loom before us, somewhere in the intangible distance.

Somewhere on the road ahead

*“Where am I? How did I get here? Where am I going? How will I get there, other than just one foot in front of the other?”*

These and a thousand other questions bombarded my thoughts, allowing me no rest. Thoughts that have nothing to do with the physical road I am on, but about life itself. Life, the only road which possesses the ability to affect my existence based on the choices I make during my travels from cradle to grave. My destination, as I have already made mention of, which is seemingly set. I am heading for the illusionary mountains on this, the longest road of my life. I mention this again in order to better clarify something I have learned about this road which I call life. When I was young, the mountains appeared to be the age of sixteen and the obtainment of a driver’s license. Yet once I reached this destination I learned that it was not truly a destination, merely a milestone. A signpost or landmark along the way. So I hurried on towards my next mountain. This may have been graduating college, or getting a job, getting married, having children, or leaving my mark on the world in some other tremendous yet trivial way. It is always different for each of us, yet not really. Why? Because we eventually come to the realization of something we have always known: Life’s only true destination is the grave. For as we are born, so too shall we die.

I say this not to discourage you, but rather to encourage you. As with any other road trip, it’s all about how we get to our destination. Do we crawl? Walk? Run? Roller Skate? Hitchhike? Drive? Take a bus? A Train? A Plane? Decisions, so many decisions. I learned in math class the most practical way to get from point A to point B is always a straight line. However sometimes small side trips are needed to provide a break in the scenery and the monotony. Sometimes these side trips afford us the opportunities to take a breather, to examine the road map of our lives. To see if where we are heading is really where we want to go. Do I get to grandma’s house by going around the block and through the park, or by cutting across the city’s landfill? Both ways will get me there. When I was younger I would probably have opted for quickness. I was in a hurry, all I wanted was to be grown. Now that I am older, taking time to enjoy the journey is more important.

Sometimes, as a man, I face huge challenges with pride. I am grown. I am a man. I can do things on my own and as with any road trip, I simply refuse to acknowledge that I may need to stop and ask for some directions at times. Knowledge comes from experience. How can I know where I am going if I have never been there. Sure, there are road maps but not even they can tell you everything about your journey. Where are the best places to eat? To shop? To meet interesting people with interesting tales and lessons from their own journeys? Rand McNally is good, but not *that* good.

*“Where am I? How did I get here? Where am I going? How will I get there, other than just one foot in front of the other?”*

These questions are irrelevant and about the past. How I got to where I am or how far I have come is the past and the past cannot change. If I spend all of my time focusing on the past, my future will not change either. On the longest road, problems are never really the challenge. The challenge is how we deal with problems and allow our focus to return to where it belongs, on our journey.
