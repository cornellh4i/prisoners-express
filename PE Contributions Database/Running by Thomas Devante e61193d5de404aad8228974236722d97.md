**Running by Thomas Devante**

Beating the loose gravel in New Balances; with sketchy knees, hunger, and the possibility of slipping at any moment. Talk about the perspective of running. Hopefully, I’m not going to ramble and run off at the mouth.

I considered myself a fast runner as a teenager. I possessed a hell of a startup, stutter, sprint. It helped out in football as a defensive end, linebacker, and a runnerback. Track and cross-country were also practice.

Unfortunately, I used it in running from the police. That’s what we would do (friends). If we were bored enough we’d get into some stuff just to see if we could outrun the police. It was fun, dangerous, and good practice for football. My coaches tortured us (team) with running drills. All of that still led me to my crime and a different phase of running. I stopped playing football in high school, the team sucked and I wasn’t looking forward to training camp that 2009 summer (sophomore year). So I worked; kept me out of the streets tripping. Didn’t have the reason to run anymore. But then I chose to jog on old habits.

Mentally, I chose to run from my “darkside;” bad habits and my teenage years. I wanted to be grown, graduate early, a car, apartment - adult life …. *Certified as an adult with 30 years in prison!*

Hold up! That ain’t what Devante wanted!

Time to grow up. I was running the wheel of my vibrations in all different directions.

Figuring out the source of my anger, non chalantness, boldness, aggression, narcissism, sarcasm, cleverness, creativity, deep thinking, etc. Finding out who “I AM” and my True Self. Always running from the normal, content, held by tradition, by way of systemic conditionings inertia-like style.

I ended up having to relearn what I already knew unconsciously. Selfishness would be a major one.

A rap by Juvenile; “Acting like a (explicative) who ain’t never had (explicative).” Or; “He ain’t never had nothing in life; so he selfish with what he got now!”

In some aspects, that’s my bad habit. I never had anything growing up; so I perceived. Some people assume I grew up with money or the “good life;” which is not true.

I moved around a lot. Was homeless 2 or 3 times before; living in a hotel with my mom I was good at making it seem like I had things growing up; I was no better than Pinocchio stealing Jerry’s place in running from Tom all the time. Like a hamster on a wheel watchin track and field.

I’m nonchalant with my sharing; if I got it and it’s not my last, it’s yours. If you play games, etc “Ya beat.” I’m suffering too and you are trying to manipulate me! Not happening. Anger rises like treadmill hills and I’m either going to be running and be selfless, tackle that incline and “you can win that failure of a mind game.” I ain’t gonna beg. I’ll suffer; jumping over hurdles. Assumptions are detrimental to some people, no qualified relay race. Devante can suffer with and without. I am so stubborn.

I wish I’d grown up like some cultures that relied on innovation and things in the wild. Since my ancestors were stolen from chasing around antelope, amongst lions, now we are forced to run around on structured land.

I run from tradition and this forged culture because it’s not mine; I was chased away from my roots. I’m untraditional with normal things because I don’t want to be hurt, abandoned or abused.

I don’t have many family stories, memories, traditions, or even role models or heroes to tell stories about. I barely conversate about the past; I’m still running from my past negativity.

My memories circle around things I had no business doing as a kid and pain; like hyenas around a full grown elephant.

There’s nothing to “gloat” or “brag” about. I survived a dangerous day; like a cheetah finding food. Hard to remember the good times. Too much weed.

I ran from common sense sometimes. I’m running from diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. I run and fight hard for this new discipline and tolerance called Life. I’m running small miles to be ready for the marathons.
