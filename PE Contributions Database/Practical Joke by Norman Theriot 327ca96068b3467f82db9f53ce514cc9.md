**"Practical Joke"** **by Norman Theriot**

Being a natural prankster has served me well in life, even here in prison. Every so often, someone gets me, but hey, allâ€™s fair when one plays the game. One day I had cooked a pork roast for the officers of the unit. A female guard (FSM) asked for a piece of it, so I cut a piece off and thought no more of it. The next day I had baked cookies for the ODR. I gave the kitchen captain some. A little while later, the captain knocked on the door and motioned for me to come into the office. Once in there, the captain approached me and told me to turn and put my hands behind my back. I was confused to say the least. The captain then told me that she was looking me up because the FSM told her that she ate my meat. I went from confusion to embarrassment, and everyone in the office burst out laughing. To top it off, the FSM told the captain that I had gloves on. This will be hard to top, but I look for ways to get even. Now the captain is one up.
