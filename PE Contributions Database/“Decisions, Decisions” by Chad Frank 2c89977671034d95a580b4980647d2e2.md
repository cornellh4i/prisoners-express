**“Decisions, Decisions” by Chad Frank**

Steve and Jimmy were brothers with a common bond: pro wrestling. They especially loved tag-team matches and dreamed of growing up to be a famous tag team themselves one day.

As teenagers, they formed their own backyard wrestling company with their friends. Their YouTube videos became so popular that they caught the attention of K. Fabe, the promoter of Ring of Tradition (ROT). ROT was once the most popular pro wrestling company in the world, selling out coliseums and stadiums wherever they went. These days, they’re lucky to fill armories and bingo halls. The main problem is K. Fabe’s insistence on sticking with old-school story lines and good guy (baby face) and bad guy (heel) gimmicks, neither of which don’t sit well with today’s Internet-savvy fans who can find wrestler’s true identities and backstage dirt online.

Steve and Jimmy had been packaged as the Soldiers of Fortune, a pair of camouflaged and masked mercenaries who provided their services to smaller, weaker wrestlers. The gimmick was so popular that K. Fabe decided to make the Soldiers of Mercy tag-team champions. The current champs were Border Patrol, a vaguely racist duo whose manager was a Donald Trump impersonator named Donny Deuce. The group had gained national attention after bullying stereotypical characters like Los Hombres del Malo.

In ultimate babyface fashion, the Soldiers of Mercy stepped up and issued a challenge. To add to the intrigue, the match was to be a Losers League ROT match. Fans already knew that the Border Patrol was headed to Universal Wrestling Entertainment (UWE). WIth its slick production values, cutting-edge storylines, and world-wide distribution, WUE is everything that ROT is not. UWE is so hot that even celebrities beg to work there.

What fans didn’t know, however, was that Steve, the most popular member of the Soldiers of Mercy, had also been offered a deal. Should he or shouldn’t he? Steve still hadn’t made up his mind as he headed into the biggest match of his career: the main event of a pay-per-view called Making America Great Again. It was to mark the rebirth of ROT. Judging by the turn-away-crowd at the Civic Center, things certainly seemed to be heading in that direction.

Would betraying his brother be worth a shot at fame? Maybe Jimmy could join him in the UWE once he got established. Then again… Wouldn’t Jimmy jump at the opportunity if it were offered to him? Steve had heard horror stories about how wrestlers had been lured to the UWE with promises of fame and fortune by UWE promoter Vince Turner, only to be dismissed due to the slightest indiscretion. ROT’s locker room was full of such sad outcasts. Then again, those guys could be just bellyaching because they’re wash-outs.

What would be worse: washing out or never getting the opportunity to begin with? Steve wondered.

The crowd was red-hot as the Border Patrol and the Soldiers of Mercy squared off in the center of the ring. They were on the verge of rioting when Donny Deuce distracted the referee while the Border Patrol worked over Jimmy.

Steve hesitated when Jimmy hot-tagged him. He waited for Jimmy to crawl up the turnbuckles and regain his balance before letting go of the tag-rope and stepping into the squared circle.

The crowd grew deadly silent when Steve kicked Jimmy in the groin and hoisted Jimmy onto his shoulders in preparation for his finishing move, Merciful Fate.

“Dammit, Steven!” Jimmy shouted, as Steve drove Jimmy into the mat, determining both of their futures...
