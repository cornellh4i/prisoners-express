****Grandparents always seem to be nice; mine were. I didn’t meet all of my grandparents until I was a teenager, and we went to my home country to meet them before they passed away. The little time I did spend with them was so pleasant.

Growing up, I often heard negative things about my grandparents. I won’t go into detail, but I will say, I wasn’t sure I wanted to meet them. My paternal grandfather walked out on the family after having lots of kids with my grandmother. The rumor was that he also had many children with other women, none of whom I’ve ever met. I would say he was half decent, although, in many ways, he was the same.

My paternal grandmother was said to dislike my mother because she took her favorite son. I always saw mother and grandmother get along fine.

My maternal grandmother seemed adamant that her daughter was not going to go with my father. Father and grandmother were slightly cool with each other but never unpleasant.

My maternal grandfather was somewhat hesitant to let his most beautiful daughter go to my father. My father won him over with liquor and an all-night conversation. Grandfather and father always got along well. It was hard to tell who was more glad to see whom when we visited.
