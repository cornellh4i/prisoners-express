**“Lost and Found” by William Andrews**

****I found them, or maybe they found me. As fast as they’d appear, they would disappear. Some within days, some weeks. Then so would I.

The first couple found were in Waco, Texas. I was living in a small apartment, and my life was beginning to unravel--again. I had a misdemeanor court date pending which meant going to jail and losing everything: the job, apartment, and my stuff. Things were beginning to feel very temporary and meaningless.

The girlfriend and I had been riding around the rundown side of town when a small, dirty, sad-looking creature crawled from underneath a boarded up building on the corner of the street. Its eyes locked on us as if it were expecting us, and I whistled and coerced the stray. Within seconds, she was in my lap. The intersection at which we found her was Dallas Street and some numbered crossway, and so we named her Dallas. After feeding and giving her a much needed flea bath, my apartment became her domain. She acted as if she cared less about going outside anymore, except to poop. Then she would hurry back across the threshold, safe and sound once again.

One sunny weekend morning, I opened my door to let in the cool air, leaving it open. Dallas went outside, and I never saw her again.

Within a few days, another stray (this one was a fluffy black blur of a beast) came running to my front door with no collar or leash dragging, and so I adopted it. I still asked around if anyone may have lost him, but there were no claims. He stayed about a week until one day, he too vanished.

Then I went to court and then to county jail for the summer.

Years later, I once again found myself on the cusp of losing my freedom. Things were looking bleak, and I couldn’t manage my way out of a wet paper sack. Bad choices, drugs, booze, and lame relationships were all my world had to offer. So I saw the end of my freedom coming at a pace I couldn’t stop. *No* real friends, just those posing to be, and my options seemed to narrow each day.

Then it happened. Riding to the store for more beer, I noticed that down the busy main street, there he was running as if he were trying to blend into traffic, hanging his tongue out, keeping a steady gallop astride traffic, heading in our same direction, and occasionally peering over his shoulder as if waiting for us to catch up. We pulled into the station, and I called him. “Get over here!” He came right to me, jumping into the truck and mostly into my lap. He began to lick me with slobbery affection. He was a fullsize pitbull, red in color with clipped ears. He loaded up into the truck as if he did it all the time. When we got back to the house just around the corner, my friend’s wife saw the dog in the truck as were pulling up. She asked what we were doing with it since she just ran it off from the front yard a little while ago. It was as if the pooch had been looking for me first!

So I kept him around for a while. He was healthy, and maybe his owner would put up notice soon. He was easy to walk on a leash, never tugging and always minding his manners. He would even ignore the barking dogs… behind the fenced yards. At first, he would start to flare, but by simply telling him to “be nice,” he’d look at me with big, brown, wet eyes and blink before he continued walking. He had a habit of pooping in the street, even though he’d sniff around on the grass next to the curb and circle around a couple times. After doing that, he’d step out in the street and arch up on the asphalt. Passing motorists would look at me with disdain, and neither he nor I would care.

It was getting colder, and so I would let him in the house to stay warm at night. He kept me company as well, being the best listener possible to my rants or worries. Usually, he would sleep at my feet, not moving all night, and he would fart. They were probably the worst farts that I have ever been exposed to. When he did, he’d turn around and look at his rear like he couldn’t believe it came from him. Then he would look at me to see if I noticed. I did.

One night, I had left him outside, and in the morning, all that was to be found was the chain and collar. He was gone. Then I went to prison.

I reminisce on the companionship those strays provided when I, too, was lost. Maybe it was I who was found and tolerated by the only beings that could at the time. I was allowed to walk that path with their company, just as I was. Be it good or bad, they accepted me.
