**“Distant Relatives” by Delvin Diles**

My biological dad was absent most of my life, so Mama did the best she could to raise me. She had the help of my sister’s dad one year, but they’d be separated by the time she was born. Mama left him because his crack addiction and joblessness rendered him unsuitable as a spouse. The poverty didn’t last long enough for me to see it as anything more than the first few months of 2nd grade, when I had a mattress for a bed, and got to go to 3 different elementary schools. I thought it was fun.

My mother didn’t get married again until after I came to prison. The guy she married, LV, is one of her old boyfriends she’s known since middle school. He would visit us when I was growing up on rare occasions. On one visit I stole his car and wrecked it. Dude never even so much as frowned about it. Nothing like Mama. She caught me stealing from her purse once and I knew when she stated, “You just wait,” that was my cue to run for my life.

They’re both retired now, living in the ‘burbs. I write ‘em, but they only send money in response. Can’t say I blame ‘em.
