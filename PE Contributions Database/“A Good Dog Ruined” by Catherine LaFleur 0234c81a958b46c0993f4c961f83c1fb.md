**“A Good Dog Ruined” by Catherine LaFleur**

As a child, I spent many summers in the tiny town of Meriveaux, South Carolina with my grandfather and assorted relatives. On a clear day, you can stand on the highest hill in Meriveaux and see King’s Mountain in the distance. At the bottom of the hill is Pecan Grove, my grandfather’s country store/filling station on the side of Route 9. Grandfather’s driveway meanders behind the store through a mature pecan orchard and a copse of dogwood trees. At the right time of year, you will be driving up to the house through drifts of pastel colored petals.

Once at my grandfather’s, I would tumble out of the car and into the arms of my cousins serenaded by the joyous accompaniment of the dogs Zero, Tick, and Radio. Our ragtag summer tribe consisted of: Braun, MariSuz, Ann, Trish, and myself. We would run around clad in disreputable looking shorts and t-shirts and worn tennis shoes with gimme caps from Pecan Grove smashed on our heads. The adults were pretty permissive and hands-off as long as no one was bleeding or unconscious.

The dogs were what fascinated me. Not that I hadn’t been around dogs, but these were hunting' dogs. Dogs with a real purpose. Zero was a Carolina Bird dog, silky white with blonde spots. He had long legs and a feathery tail. Tick was a bloodhound with a mournful droopy face full of wattles. Radio was a hound of indeterminate lineage but he would follow Zero and Tick to hell and back if necessary.

I was told to leave the dogs alone. Like that command could work. I finally selected Zero as my victim. He slept on the back-porch on a scrap of plaid blanket. Several nights in a row, I would sneak out of bed, stealthily open the screen door and lure Zero inside with baloney slices. Zero was helpless to resist.

I let Zero sleep on the floor under my daybed. I’d leave my hand hanging down and nestled in his fur. During the day I’d take him down to the little stream behind the house. My object was to teach Zero some tricks. I taught him to catch a tossed treat, to speak, and to chase a tattered ball. And the latter is a big no-no.

You can’t teach bird dogs to chase a ball. It ruins them for the field. Once they chase things other than birds, they will be alert on anything. Ah well. Apparently, I ruined Zero. However, he was allowed to become a house dog where he would lie belly up and spraddle legged in convenient sunny patches, so I guess it all worked out for the best.
