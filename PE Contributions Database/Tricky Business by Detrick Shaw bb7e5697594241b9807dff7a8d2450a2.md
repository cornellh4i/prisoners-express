**Tricky Business by Detrick Shaw**

Well now the title speaks

for its own, the way we move

Is quite tricky takes real wits

people donâ€™t really get it too much

rat play not A-nutt (Blank?)

you should understand how tricky

the business is cause at the end of the day

tricks are for kids anyway

hard job, but someone

has to do it what a Tricky Business

It is stay safe

we are still in the streetz
