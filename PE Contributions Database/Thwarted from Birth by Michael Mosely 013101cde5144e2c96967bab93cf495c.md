**“Thwarted from Birth” by Michael Mosely**

Having seen more than my fair share of demographic privilege disrupt the disenfranchised state of mind, I am often forcibly consumed by an anticlimactic thought process that only sees reason in lies, for truth has three tales to tell: your truth, my truth, and the actual truth.

For so many years my mindset and intellectual thirst was quenched from a tainted well, that often beget a need of me to show and prove: not by thought or finesse, but by brute force. That once I was exposed to a truth that coincided with my own thought, I couldn’t help but not only feel my thirst slacken, but also I knew that without a doubt my life would be changed forever.

The fact that only now, once I was again cemented away from my fellow travelers, is my mind free to roam, carefree, and lacking nothing. This to me seems normal, but I also am cognitively aware enough to realize that this is abnormal to our contemporary society.

These symptoms I fully recognize as the dredges of the lasting vestiges of institutional slavery.

For so long I could never understand how I being of sound mind, could even from the first moment of incarceration be comfortable. Almost like that of a slave mentality; simply accepting my circumstantial fate as something I could neither change, nor prevent its inception into my life.

To not only see from outward, but inward as well, the totality of my circumstances would be but a blessing. Unfortunately often we, and I mean almost all of humanity, are blind until after our circumstances are revealed to us, and for good or bad we must face the consequences.

Having grown in these contemporary times led not by knowledge, but a sense of self worth that coincided with the mentality of the inner city male demographic, that often called for anger, distortion and a constant need to show how alpha one was. This psychosis more than not leads to what I call a “worthless need to belong.” That at times ends more often than not in one's absolute subjection to the institution of “the new Jim Crow,” a term that was coined by Professor Michelle Alexander.

Rather it be the goal to obtain: drugs, money by the stack, women by the stable or cars by the lot. The mentality of the inner city male youth often involves violence and a mutual feeling of distrust and smoldering rage towards his perceived oppressor, most likely portrayed as the man in blue, and more specifically aimed at the white male hegemony. For it is these conditions of self-shacklement that often birth from one to another, the “see’s” and “I told you so’s,” and the psychosis of a worthless need to belong continues to turn anew.

The mental faculties that seem to be bred into each one of my station—that of an inner city upbringing. Rather male or female are far beyond bound, but something happens along the way, something that registers deep within our collective psyche, and because of this our potential for betterment is drastically reduced, and the factors that contribute are so common, so numerous that we have no escape other than sheer luck.

The circumstances of our youth thwart us from establishing a base and living a life of normalcy --the American dream.
