**“‘Here’ and ‘There’” By Tom Farlow**

“Are we there yet?”

“You know Goose, we haven’t been on the move for more than five minutes, and you’re already asking ‘Are we there yet?’. Does it look like we are there?”

“I dunno. You are the one driving. How am I supposed to know what ‘there’ looks like?”

Right now, you are ‘here.’ When we get ‘there,’ ‘there’ will be ‘here.’”

“So we are ‘here?’”

“Right.”

“So, we are ‘there?’”

“Not yet.”

“When will ‘here’ be ‘there?’”

“When we get ‘there.’”

“So we are ‘here’ still?”

“Right.”

“How much longer till we are ‘there?’”

“Until we get ‘there.’”

“So why are we still ‘here?’”

“We are always ‘here.’ We just keep moving until ‘there’ and ‘here’ line up to be ‘here.’”

“I hate being ‘here.’ ‘Here’ is boring. I want to go ‘there.’”

“You don’t even know what is at ‘there.’ How do you know it is better than ‘here?’”

“You said it would be fun ‘there.’ That’s how.”

“What if I said we are ‘there?’”

“Can’t be.”

“Why not?”

“It’s not fun.”

“It is fun for me to make you think ‘here’ is ‘there.’”

“Oh sod your bloody knickers! Keep moving, you crazy Fox. I want to get ‘there’ before I die of old age and can’t have fun.”

“(Snort)... Do you want to know ‘where’ ‘there’ is?...”
