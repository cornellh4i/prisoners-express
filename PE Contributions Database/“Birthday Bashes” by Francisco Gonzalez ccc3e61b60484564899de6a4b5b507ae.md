**“Birthday Bashes” by Francisco Gonzalez**

My birthday is August 14, 1976. The day I was born, my Papa Senor Guadalupe Jose Gonzalez celebrated his 23rd birthday! It turned out to be his happiest birthday. My mom, Alicia, recalls the moment my Papa woke up, thrilled and overjoyed to have his first-born son in his arms. He couldn’t believe his fortune when days ago he asked mom what she was going to give him on his birthday. I was born on that joyful day, and my mom proudly handed me over to Papa, saying, “There you go, your son.”

The special moment makes me realize to this day what a blessing it was to be born on a day that would be immortalized.

The noteworthy events not only gave Papa the ultimate blissful moment, but he honored me by naming me after his father----Mr. Francisco Gonzalez from Michoacan, Mexico. Indeed, what an honor to be paying respect to such a great man that my papa emulated down to a tee.

It’s hard to compare the two men after all these years, but I must hand it off to papa for doing much more with much less. Guadalupe’s great qualities were undeniable; he was a highly intelligent and kind compassionate man with a good sense of humor. He was the strong-minded hard-working man in our familia. He was a devout Catholic and a classic alpha-male, the one that kept the whole familia together. Whether it was family gatherings for the holidays or birthdays, he was there fornt and center. If anyone in the family had a problem or needed advice, “Tio Lupe” was the man to get at.

Our birthday every August 14th was the block-party of the year, full of family and friends. My papa would literally spend the prior week planning it. My mom would tell him, “You are mad with all of these preparations!” He would plan and replan down to what live animal he would slaughter then cook up. One year, it was a hog right off a farm in Camarillo, California where my primo Hueno worked. I recall another year where he brought home a goat that he tied in the backyard. That was the year he slaughtered a calf we raised ourselves. I remember my seventh birthday, feeding this calf grass and feeling sorry for this creature. I was admonished and told not to feed an animal that’s already prepared for our slaughter.

About forty-five minutes later, my papa grabbed this huge butcher’s knife while his friends held the animal down, and just like that my papa went at it, starting at the throat.

I didn’t watch the rest of the slaughter, but stood around once music started blasting. The fiesta was on! It’s strange and funny how I can still vividly remember that particular birthday that we celebrated. And now here’s the best part, I was always first to open presents. My Papa loved to watch me with his huge proud smile.

My Nina Sylvia, who always called me by “Mi Rey,” gave the best presents. Whether it was my birthday or Christmas, I could always count on my Nina for the best toys. The woman knew her way to a kid’s heart. Visits by Nina were always accompanied by plenty of kisses and a gift. What a privilege it was to be loved by my Nina.

My childhood was so happy when my papa was alive and healthy. He even started his own contracting business with only a second grade education from Mexico. He was a pillar of the small community where was known for getting the job done and treating clients just like family, no matter who they were. He taught me a lot of life’s lessons that I carry with me until this day. How special is all that? Don’t ask because I could go on forever telling you about my papa. The man my mom loved wholeheartedly, made all the sacrifices to maintain his vows, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part. My mom was his backbone and kept him truly humble. She would often taunt him when he got worked up.

“Que genio!” she called. “El famoso coraje.”

He was a man slow to answer, but watch out because he was an incredibly proactive man of action. On August 14th I not only celebrate the day I was born, but also the life of this great man who took part in giving me life. He will always be remembered as my idol. Happy Birthday Senor!
