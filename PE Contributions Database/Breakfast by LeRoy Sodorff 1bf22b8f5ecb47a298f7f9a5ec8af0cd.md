**"Breakfast" by LeRoy Sodorff**

In our household everyone worked, with the exception of me, to make breakfast a family affair. Daddy brought home the bacon, momma made the bread and butter, sister milked the cash cow, and I provided the goose eggs.

Breakfast

By "emily"

Our mother was very abusive towards us six girls and breakfast was just the start of her day. She beat the eggs, whipped the butter, and roasted the coffee while everything else was toast. For supper, being such small potatoes, she put us all in hot water, stirred the pot, and cooked our goose.
