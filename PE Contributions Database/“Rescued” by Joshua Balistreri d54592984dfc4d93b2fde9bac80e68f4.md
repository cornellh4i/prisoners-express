**“Rescued” by Joshua Balistreri**

I can’t recall who said it, “It happened gradually, and all at once” rings true. That’s how it all seemed to happen, through my eyes anyway.

My life was, for once, going pretty well. I had moved out to the east coast to Florida.

The place was like nothing I had ever experienced before. So far removed from where I had come from that i was like a whole new world to me. A place where I could start over from scratch.

My girlfriend was living in Concord, in Northern California, and I was in San Diego, in southern California, when we decided to make the move. She was the one, and it was time for us to try to be together. We have known each other since high school, and although I’d been in love with her since the day we met, it had taken us until then to connect. Finally, we were going to make our life together.

The plan was for me to go out ahead of her and establish myself. So I did. A few months later, I had steady work and rented a small but nice house for us. Now it was time for her to join me, and she did; it was a dream come true.

For months it went well, but all dreams do not last. I’m not exactly sure what it was that triggered the change. Perhaps it was just something wrong with me. Some wiring in my brain that got crossed. Or maybe a disagreement between us. Maybe I just wasn’t happy with our financial situation. I can’t be certain. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to pinpoint the exact moment I began to slip. Though now, I look back on it, it seemed inevitable. One minute I think I’m floating safe and free in a near perfect vacuum, and slowly but surely, I feel the pull of gravity from a distant black hole. Quicker and quicker I fell towards my destruction.

Gradually things became too stressful between her and me. There was a break. She left our little dream house and left me to my own devices. That has never been a good thing for me.

The pull of gravity felt stronger and acceleration increased.

Eventually, and it didn’t take long, my mind became so discontent that I decided to leave my promised land. I returned home to old friends and old ways.

I would tell myself I had done it to protect her. Out of love for her, and to some degree that is true I suppose. For a time after she had moved out and before I’d left, we attempted to resolve our issues. They never really were our issues. They were mine alone. I saw no sense in dragging her down with me.

The torment and chaos of it all drove me mad and of course, being around old friends, and being back to my old ways, it wasn’t hard to fall into old habits. I spiraled further down into the vortex.I stopped caring, and that’s when things are at their worst. It became clear to me that there was only one conclusion.

However, I was wrong. There is always more than one way for things to end. Fortunately, the decision was taken away from me. I will never truly know which way things could have gone, and that’s the funny thing about all the could’ve beens in life. That’s the simple fact of life. There’s no way to truly know. It didn’t go down a certain way, and nothing can change that.

Yes, I committed a crime. I’m serving an extensive prison sentence for it. Quite possibly for the rest of my natural life, but in coming to prison I was rescued. Saved from self annihilation. I was given another chance at life.

Now, you may wonder what kind of life is it? How can one truly live from behind prison walls? My answer is simple. The only other option was to not live at all. Although I may sit in a concrete cell, my mind is free. At least I still have a life to live.
