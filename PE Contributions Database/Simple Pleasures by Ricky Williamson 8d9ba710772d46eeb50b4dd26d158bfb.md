**"Simple Pleasures" by Ricky Williamson**

What greater joy can a person experience? Simple pleasures conjure up so many and myriad thoughts for me! Some, we all share due to common humanity, some due to our individually.

The first simple pleasure that comes to mind is a baby's smile. It can and does malt the hardest heart! Watching sunrises and sunrises, sleeping under the cover of stars on the mantle of the earth, a job well done...

This list is endless and full of possibilities, but the hustle and bustle of modern life hides them from us as we rush hither and thither, I say slow down, reach out, and grasp what eludes so many of us.

The second simple pleasure that comes to mind is...can you fill in this spot? Need help? A Life well lived, hot oatmeal on a freezing cold morning, the once in a lifetime dog who was your friend and companion. Being in love and making love (Whoops! That might not be a simple pleasure at times!)

The number of simple pleasures is finite, so I won't number a third one, but to know they exist, and come in infinite forms should show each and every one of us how lucky we are. Over and out.
