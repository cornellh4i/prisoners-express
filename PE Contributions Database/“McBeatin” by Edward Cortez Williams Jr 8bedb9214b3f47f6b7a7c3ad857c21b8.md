**“McBeatin” by Edward Cortez Williams Jr.**

Hey there, Stranger, you listenin’? As I was sayin’, you’re free ta travel ‘round all these parts, but steer clear o’ that mountain, ya hear? The other locals won’t like me gettin’ into details, but I feel like it’s best ta tell yer kid WHY he shouldn’t touch the stove, ya know?

Well, some time back, don’t ask me how long, there was a string o’ murders ‘round here. The locals blamed some poor ol’ colored fella, hung ‘Im up to dry. Well, the murders stopped fer a couple o’ months and they thought it was over. Everything went back to hunky-dory, ya see? But that poor black fella wasn’t the one that done it!

Naw, some more killin’s took off and everyone was in a doozy tryna find ‘im! To ta find out, some great big Scottish fella lives up in that there mountain, somewheres or another. Calls ‘imself McTreatin. Folks ‘round ‘ere call ‘im McBeatin cuz ‘e beat all them poor people ta death.

Well, them townsfolk didn’t take too kindly ta that, so they formed a search party. Turned into a lynch mob when they found ‘e ‘ad a cave ‘round the back side o’ that mountain. Now, this was before they invented that ol’ Tommy Gun, ya see? So one o’ the townsfolk, he brought a good ol’ fashioned shotgun to the dance. The mob wanted to hang his big ol’ tail, McBeatin, that is, but Mr’ Shotgun got a bit nervous when he sent ‘im up close. He fired at ‘im, all close like, but McBeatin, didn’t even buckle! This fella says, he says, “I’ll leave yer town alone if you leave me alone, and that’s the only offer I got. What’s it gonna be? Y’all want a war?”

Well quite rationally speakin’, ain’t no self-respectin’ man gonna go toe-ta-toe with an eight foot fella that eats a bowl o’ buckshot fer breakfast without any milk. So they turnt tail an’ ran. They don’t bother him and he ain’t been back since, but the folks ‘round here, they still use ‘is name ta scare the bad kids, ya see? ‘Stead of the ol’ Boggerman, it’s McBeatin that come’ta beat all the bad kids ta death. And sho nuff, when they show them that there raveyard they built for them fifty-six people he beat ta death, them kids is right as rain, little angels, I’m tellin’ ya.

So you stay far ‘way from that there mountain, Stranger. Cuz I’m willin’ ta bet ten dollars and a dime that if you go messin’ ‘round there, they’ll beat you worse than ol’ McBeatin’ would. Take care, now.
