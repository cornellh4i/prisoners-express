**“IDITAROD: DAY FOUR” by Thomas Farlow**

Cold. I would have to wake up to this today. Cold and wet. Which one was it? Wiping my eyes to run the sleep away, I raised the slits just as a glob of pink wetness hit my cheek and shoved its way up, over my eyes, across my brow, and—I’m sure—melted into strands of my hair. Yuck!

Burrowing my head into the soft, warm fabric of my sleeping bag to dry my now accosted face, I reopened my eyes to see a smiling grin on Gamba’s dark face. Good morning to you too, cute stuff.

That was Gamba though. He was my ever present sidekick and support, since he was old enough to come home with me. I’ve owned a lot of dogs (still do), but Gamba stood out from all of the others. He wasn’t alpha like Viola, my ferocious female leading the pack. Usually my dogs would find ways into my heart in groups, always bum-rushing me as I came home for some love and attention. When it was all doled out and time to call it a day, they would retreat to their respective beds and sleep in contented bliss.

Not Gamba.

The first night he came home, he snuck into my room and managed to climb into my bed. When the morning came, feeling the fluffy warmth surprised me. It’s been that way, sharing the king size bed, the past four years now. I like to think he assumes he can always curl up next to me by this leisure at bedtime. All four of them in the tent was a community experience. This year’s Iditarod is my new team’s first: Viola and Gamba, who I’ve mentioned already, accompanied by Loran and Yagi. They seemed to work well together so far. We had a good run going yesterday. Then, Mother Nature reared her ugly head with white out conditions.

I didn’t spot the clouds until Yagi kept glancing to the Southwest. I looked and saw the rolling clouds hurtling fast; snow covered survivors were the only way we were going to make it through. I pulled up at a clearing among some trees on the trail to set up our camp. I had planned on going twice as far, but I can only hope the other competitors have the same delays. While I set up the tent and secured the sled, Yagi’s nervousness had the other three fidgety like the agitated two-year olds all lathered up over a change in what we trained for. The shelter went up frantically to ease the tension and we all slept snuggly warm like a pack congregated in a cave den.

When I unzipped the flap, I was greeted with the blinding, snow-white powder that covered everything, light rebounding off the flakes in every shade possible of yellow and white. If the Aurora Bealis had its yin to its yang, this would be it. I looked at the trail and said…”What trail?”

Six-feet deep in every direction obliterated the race trail. Loran was going to have her work cut out today. Due west today until we hit something familiar.

I’m going to run them in a side-by-side formation to start today. We need to haul ourselves out of this mess, and perhaps those behind us need a trail to follow, also. If we meet on a road, I’ll switch them to the traditional nose-to-tail.

Going to stow this journal with all the gear and head out. God bless us today.
