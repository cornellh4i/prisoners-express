**“In the Land of Other Gods” by Catherine LaFleur**

After spending years toiling in the bowels of the prison’s law library as a clerk, I found myself becoming depressed. In a regular year, there may be 6-7 disturbing cases on my desk, but that year, 26 horrific cases were assigned to me. It became difficult not to be judgemental. That is when I knew I needed time away.

At the same time, a new Senior Chaplain was hired: Dr. Robin. She was a delightful pixie of a woman, full of song and praise just like her name. One day, I happened to be delivering papers to her office, and she asked me to sit down and tell her about myself. We talked for two hours, and then she offered me the job of chaplain’s clerk, a new job that no one had ever been assigned before. I immediately said no. Law clerk is the best job to have in prison: it comes with many unstated benefits. Why would I leave my extra large desk located directly under the air conditioner vent for an unknown quantity?

Dr. Robin asked two more times over the next week, and I still said thank you but no. Unfortunately, I couldn’t sleep after that. At 2:00 A.M., my eyes would pop open, and I would lay, staring at my ceiling of my cell until 5 in the morning. I am not the type of person who hears the voice of God calling in the night, or really at any other time. I thought my number was unlisted, but somehow, she got it.

Finally, I went back to Dr. Robin at the end of the week and told her what was happening. Within 3 days, I had been job changed because Dr. Robin personally marched my papers through. It was a real leap of faith to leave the law library for the unknown. I was frightened. Was I crazy? The other law clerks certainly thought so. Even the supervisor kept questioning me… Are you sure about this?

I got assigned an extra large desk and got to sit in the back office with a dedicated file cabinet and a cabinet of curiosities. The cabinet was stuffed with the accoutrements for different worship services. Our chapel is full service, meaning it represents all of the major religious and spiritual groups, not just the ones approved by the Republican Party. One of my duties was to take care of these religious items. In short, I was to guard the materials to make sure no one was: using prayer rugs for home decor, stealing prayer and rosary beads for use as hair ornaments or beading projects, using zafus as decorative throw pillows, making the runes into scrabble tiles, drawing a moustache on our Lady of Peace, graffiting on the Sacred Heart of Jesus, shredding the Buddhist books, defacing the Quran, or obliterating the alternative religious resources. Mostly, it was the adherents of only one fundamentalist religious persuasion who felt a calling to do these kinds of things. Some of the more insistent Pentecostal type persons were anxious to tell me what “their god” has told them. Apparently, there were many gods with conflicting points of views jamming up the midnight phone lines. This is why the cabinet had a combination lock on it, and I learned to bare my teeth menacingly and moved the cabinet behind the desk.

At first, it was a struggle to not tell people what to do. After all, as a law clerk, people wanted me to make decisions for them. Now, it wasn’t my job to tell people what to do anymore; they have to make choices by themselves. Reviewing your options is what free will is all about. Ask my personal opinion, and I’ll give it. You would be surprised what worshippers come out of the woodwork once they feel there isn’t going to be any persecution about their religious preference. I liked helping them because otherwise, we’d never be able to have a conversation. I found that you don’t have to agree with those you are serving in order to be happy in the work.

The sedentary job in the law library was a lot different than my running around in the chapel. There was always something to do, papers to deliver to different departments, flyers to post, inmates to track down, and services to set. Because of limited space, some of the programs did not actually meet in the chapel but in satellite locations all around the compound. My co-workers and I were always hauling things down to these classrooms then collecting them afterwards. It was a labor of love. Service work makes you a happier person.

One day, I was helping to set up for the weekly Rosary Prayer. Carefully, I brought the statues out to a side room in the sanctuary. My co-workers were arranging the battery-powered votive candles and decorating the table with plastic plants and fruit. In walked one of the Little Sisters of Charity who occasionally came to the prison. It was Sister Glorious Savior. She walked right up and gave us hugs and pats on the shoulder, exclaiming what a beautiful presentation was set on the table. I happened to look down at Sister’s feet and noted that we were wearing the same shoes as her: humble, black Crocs.

I think no matter what leap of faith we are asked to make, faith shoes are going to be provided.
