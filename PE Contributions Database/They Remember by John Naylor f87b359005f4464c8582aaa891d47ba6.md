**They Remember by John Naylor**

Forgotten. The image of many men in prison. Though much of what I was taught by O.G. Honkeys are no longer common, the spirit still remains. My dad was blue collar, a journeyman electrician. Thankfully, he was scared of getting caught and going to prison. Though his thoughts didn’t usually transpire to action, the Spirit of resilience has throughout. He used to have mob movies because he hated the arrogant superiority of the victimizers. He was more of a Charles Brownson “Death Wish” type of guy in his angry fantasy world. And with the more time I spend in prison around evil men, the more I see and believe it: being resilient is crucial. Though I am 36 as I write this now, I think of tactics, strategies. I pick my battles. Because I’m not in the business of being the all time loser on account of my convictions. I remember that surviving is my priority, not what I feel inside my heart. Sometimes I have to flip my switch, empathy. Such a hard thing. I try to recall what Dr. Perry taught me in Anger Management classes. He said “Don’t defend the oppressed unless you’re willing to take on the oppressor”. Truer words cannot be spoken. Every once in a while, I can make a real difference for good. Long as I keep off the radar. Blend in. I think if Charles Bronson hunted me like on “Death Wish” it’d just be an honest mistake. Though I know better than to come to his aid. Be it due to the streets or the courts. A one man band doesn’t play forever. And in real life Charles Bronson wouldn’t have survived for so many sequels. Nor would the powers that be overlook him. Still I hope for good men to support good as that I’m not alone when I stand. I have great concern for the future. Remember though dear reader: “Don’t defend the oppressed unless you’re willing to take on the oppressor” - Dr. Perry. Oh yeah! And like the frog, half swallowed while choking the crane said with inspiring words, Never give up!
