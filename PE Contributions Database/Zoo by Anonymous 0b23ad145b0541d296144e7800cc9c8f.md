**Zoo by Unknown Artist**

I am now back in prison finishing my time. I was at a Mental Health Facility, there were so many things wrong there. I stopped feeling safe after a girl punched another in the face and all the staff was put in her room and RTU to the unit for 72 hours. She was threatening other girls and nothing was done about it. She would always talk about violence.

Now I have PTSD and that brought up a lot of unwanted memories I didn’t like. I felt anxious, paranoid, and started to stay in my room all the time.

On top of all this I was having to hold in my grief, because my daddy died January 3, 2017. The hospital had me just sweep all my feelings inside and not deal with them. I hadn’t got to deal with anyone. I had to get up and go to classes, they allowed me one day to grieve and then it was back to classes.

I have so much anger already built up inside, not only for my crime but also for not being able to grieve like I am supposed to do or have any grief counseling. Feeling this way has not been easy to live with. I already have depression and am a cutter. I fight each and every symptom.

Being in a mental hospital I thought they would take care of my mental health better but they didn’t, they just made it worse.

To me the word zoo was how I felt inside. I didn’t know which way to go. I didn’t know if I was going to be like a caged animal sometimes, I felt angry and anxious all of the time.

Zoo can also mean how hectic our lives are each and every day. On the outside my life was hectic. I literally thought I was going crazy. I didn’t have enough time for myself. At that time I was using drugs. I thought my world was ok, little did I know that it was going to crumble in pieces. Then it did and since 2007, I have been serving a 25 year sentence.

I’m not at all proud of my crime. Being in prison is also like a zoo. You have inmates locked in seg., or I-max on a 23 hour lockdown policy, just depends where you’re at. The people wardens are caretakers like at a zoo. There’s also teachers who teach us things.

So, what it comes down to is how we see our lives. We don’t have to feel like a zoo, we can always go to classes and educate ourselves.

I’m sitting in my cell on the MHU Pod 4. I’m back in prison now. I got transferred last Wednesday. Now I can get help; I can take grief classes. I am happy I’m back. I know I’ll be alright.

If I could take a picture of what I look like in the mornings you would all think I belong in a zoo. LOL.

On a serious note, there’s always our loved ones who care about us and when we are at the zoo, just always remember we were at one point in our lives in a zoo, locked up or not.
