**“Irrefutable Evidence” by Alan Coleman**

“Look, the proof is right there! It’s all the proof you need. Wipe the algae out of your eyes and take a long look”, she said. “I looked. I hardly think just a photo of a shadowy figure proves anything. A photo can be faked-especially one from that far away,” he replied, “Sure, it’s a piece of evidence, but definitely not ‘proof’”.

“It’s not just a photo, some random photo unrelated to anything else. Have you forgotten the first hand accounts of hundreds of sightings over the years?” she asked. “This has been a legend throughout history.”

“Yes, exactly that-a legend. A fairy tale for overactive imaginations, nothing more.”

“This photo is no fairy tale. It’s physical proof at last!”

“Don’t you think that if it were real, we’d have a lot more photos than just yours?” he asked. “Do you actually believe that only you has ever had the bright idea of bringing a camera up there? Everyone’s been staking out that lake since cameras were invented. Yet only now you has been lucky enough to capture a photo of one of the most famous legends in the history of the world. Really?”

“Well...uh...well yes,” she answered. “I guess I am lucky.”

The editor stared at her for several seconds before going on. “You know, it strokes me that the timing of all of this is more then a little suspicious…” he said, never taking his eyes off of her.

She stretched her long neck a little farther and learned toward the editor. “And what’s that supposed to mean?” she asked with just the slightest edge of defiance in her voice.

“Oh, so I guess we are going to just pretend that you were not just standing in this office one week ago being warned by me that if you don’t stop hanging out at that lake and instead start bringing me something I can actually write about, something newsworthy, I was just going to put you on the classified ad ‘typing pool’”.

“Yes, yes, but I swear this had nothing to do with that. It was just a coincidence. Serendipity. Ok, so I was at the lake, but I was there because I wanted to get a photo of the freshwater barnacles that I had heard were so hard to ger off of your tail. I thought if I could get a really graphic picture of that you could write a great ‘Your Health’ piece about it. So I had already had my camera out, and I happened to look towards the shore where that dock is, and there it was, just sitting there. It’s the scoop of the century, I tell ya!”

She looked off into space as if she were reading a billboard. “Photographic Proof That Humans Exist!” it would say. That headline alone will sell a lot of papers. But then-BAM!” She made a rectangular frame in the air. “My beautiful photo, front and center… You could interview a cryptozoologist and then interview me as an eyewitness. Sir, this is history we are making! It will put us all on the map. Everyone in all of Scotland will buy our paper, I tell ya!” she exclaimed.

“Or they will stop at the torch store on their way down here to run us out of town for being CRACKPOTS!”

The editor thought for a moment. “Maybe if we had a few more photos… a close-up, maybe. Something showing its face… But with just one picture… Now, it’s just too risky.”

This was all the opening she needed. “Well then I think it’s clear what I must do. I’m just going to have to swim right back down to the end of the loch with my camera, stick my head up out of the water, and snap the photo that’s going to win me the Pulitzer. I won’t come back until I have irrefutable photo graphic evidence that humans are real. As real as you and me!” she said.

“You do that, Nessie, you do that,” the editor replied. But he was not convinced.
