**Rescued by James Bauhaus**

When the goons first dragged me to their slow-death camp, one of the first memes that I noticed was that if you made too much of your living by mooching freebies off of other inmates, those inmates would remark loudly “you didn’t just get caught and locked up! You got rescued!”

This type of sarcasm/ insult never seemed to slow the mooch/ “hustle” parasitism common in all places of extreme deprivation, but it did make it move to different victims.

Another way that mooch-targets would get rid of inmates who kept coming back to leech off the easy marks is to tell the beggar, “You need to spread your hustle around!”

The primary trouble is several-fold: Slavery does not pay well, no matter how intelligent or energetic you are, except for the parasites who exploit their slaves. You may be surprised to learn that we are forablably unemployed, yet are forced to pay $45/lb for salt, which is sold by the prison corporation in tiny 1/3 gram packages, like crack cocaine. Pepper is the same way, except $135/lb.

We can have all the double to quintuple priced junk food that we can pay for a week in advance with whatever money we can wheedle out of our kin and friends, but we are all prohibited from standing up like men and obtaining rights and respect. For example, last week in the middle of the night, the button-pushing kop accidentally undid the lock on the cage that they keep me in while trying to unlock the service inmate’s cage next door. This scary security breach had to be remedied ASAP! He sent his grunt-kop to go reslam this door, quickly, before some fantasy nightmare scenario developed that only the kops can imagine. While he opened to slam my door, he noticed a tiny picture of an Asian psychologist I’d taped inside there. She was smiling behind a fan of yen, celebrating her experiment involving giving away free money. This kop squinted at it, then ripped it down. Apparently not even the slightest attack upon the prison misery index can be tolerated by jealous guards. It seems apparent that the psycho-sadist who was given this prison job is so suited to his deviant personality is the one who is rescued.
