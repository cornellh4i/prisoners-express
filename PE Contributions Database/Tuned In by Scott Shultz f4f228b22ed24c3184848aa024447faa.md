**“Tuned In” by Scott Shultz**

Who isn’t tuned in? They, over in the little red house in the corner, are tuned in to a Netflix series. And over in the internet cafe around the block, they are tuned in to coffee and computer screens. Others all around are walking with phones in their faces. Tweeting this, texting that, snapping and instagramming up a storm.

Everyone is tuned in!

Youtubed in! Googled in!

Facebook has never had so many friends. Everyone is everywhere. Radio waves bounce off all of every edifice. We can’t see them, yet they are there.

They are there and we are here. We are here and they are there. Tuned in we all are. And soon we will all have a robot and self-driving car.

Drones fly all over our sky. Killer drones seek our and hunt terrorists. Amazon has delivery drones that can deliver packages all over the place. At the borders, balloons have cameras that are looking for illegal crossers. Balloon drones, what the hell?!

To be tuned in is to be connected to ourselves. Not to be tuned in is to not be. AI is growing, as we attempt to create thinking robots by reverse engineering ourselves. Actually, everything AI is everything around us.

Progress is about through being tuned in, we can learn about whatever it is we are interested in by being tuned in. If you are interested in conservation-tune in. If you are interested in international affairs-tune in. If you are interested in politics-tune in. Interested in technology, biology-tune in.

Push a button on the phone, press a key on a computer, touch a screen on a pad and you are tuned in.

Tune in.

Tune in to something, let change begin.
