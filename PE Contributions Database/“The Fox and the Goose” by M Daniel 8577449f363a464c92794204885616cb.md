**“The Fox and the Goose” by M. Daniel**

I am 64, and a million years ago - in the 1960’s while our family lived in the town of Bennydale N.Z., dad had a record (records like in an antique store) of Richard Dyre Bennett - a folk singer who recorded many old english folk songs. I do not have web access, but I believe there is still a webpage for Richard Dyre Bennett.

This page 19 picture is so perfect in that it reminds me of the song:

The fox went out on a chilly night, and he prayed to the moon to give him light. He’d many a mile to go that night.

Before he reached the town-o

town-o	town-o

Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town-o.

He ran till he came to a great big pen. The ducks and the geese were kept there-in. “A couple of you will grease my chin before the moon goes down-o down-o

A couple of you will grease my chin before the moon goes down.”

Then he grabbed the gray goose by the neck.

He flung a duck across his back.

He didn’t mind their quack quack quack and the legs all dangling down-o down-o.

He didn’t mind their quack quack quack and the legs all dangling down-o.

Then old mother flipper flopper popped out of bed and out of the window she cocked her head.

Crying “John John”! The gray goose is gone, and the fox is on the town-o town-o

John John The grey goose is gone and the fox is on the town-o.

Then John, he ran to the top of the hill, and he blew his horn loud and shrill. The fox he said better flee with my kill, they’ll soon be on my tail-o tail-o

The fox he said, “Better flee with my kill, they’ll soon be on my tail-o.”

He ran till he came to his cozy den,

There were his little ones, eight, nine, ten.

They said “Daddy, better go back again,

It must be a mighty fine town-o town-o.”

They said, “Daddy, better go back again,

It must be a mighty fine town-o.”

Then the fox and his wife, without any strife,

They cut-up the goose with a fork and knife,

They never had such a supper in their life

And the little ones chewed on the bones-o bones-o

They never had such a supper in their life

And the little ones chewed on the bones-o bones-o
