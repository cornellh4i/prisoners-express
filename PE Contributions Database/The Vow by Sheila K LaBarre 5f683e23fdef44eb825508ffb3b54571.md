**“The Vow” By Sheila K. LaBarre**

A child should be protected. That responsibility belongs to the Mother. One could say it also belongs to the Father, or caregiver. Regardless, every child should be protected from harm of any kind. This I a fact that cannot be disputed.

I never felt protected as a child. How could I? My mother had willingly married, procreated with, lived with, and refused to divorce my devoutly alcoholic father. Any subject could and did trigger loud, lengthy, frightening arguments between them. They seemed to thrive on this chaos. Peace was rare in the home.

My mother maintained the household. My father worked for the state in highway construction. Monday through Friday he left early for work and there he was his bosses’ favorite employee and his coworkers’ friend. It was at home that he exhibited volcanic rages lasting over twenty-four hours many times. Verbal abuse, physical violence, destruction to our meager household items. I’ve tried to forget so many painful memories. He never protected me from anything or anyone. Most damaging to me is the realization that my mother deliberately failed to protect me from him. When I begged her to leave him, she gave the same, bizarre response. She said, “Sheila, I took a vow for life when I married Manuel.” So, her life included witnessing and participating in the constant abuse I suffered as a child and teenager.

If I think about those awful days my mind can still imagine the odor of Pabsti Blue Ribbon beer, whiskey, or moonshine. These are not pleasant memories. They are the doorway to flashbacks of my horrible childhood. Echoes of violence and rage. I’ve become indifferent to emotional pain. I’ve closed that door and sealed it with my mind. After all, crying is a choice. Isn’t it?

When Daddy drank alcohol, he would not stop until he became so inebriated that he threatened to kill all of us. This helped to encourage my three brothers to marry and move out as teenagers. It also was the reason my oldest sister married as a teenager. That left me, my mother’s sister who is fire years older, and my mother. We were the ones he threatened to kill almost every weekend. The worst childhood memory of mine is when Daddy, drunk and homicidal, chased the three of us through a tall cornfield in darkness close to midnight. I was about five years old. I can still hear the maniacal breathing as he ran in a corn row directly beside the one in which my mother and I ran. The moon was full and it seemed to be watching us, guiding us, and protecting us. We heard him cursing, ranting, and finally retreating toward the house.

We walked, jumping into ditches to hide whenever car lights appeared on the old, blacktop road. My righthand was swollen from being hit by a metal can full of anti-freeze that my father had thrown at my mother’s face. I had protected her by blocking it with my little hand. After walking for about seven miles we reached my brother’s house. I was in shock. They did not take me to a doctor. I awoke the next day, early morning, alone. My mother had abandoned me to go see my father.

To survive in this hostile environment, I invented imaginary friends. Chak, Chardon, Serdic, and Pinky were unique and kind to me. I would enter a dark closet, close the door, and talk to them in the closet. Derdic and Pinky were Chak and Chardon’s children. They wore fur clothes and had long, dark hair. They appeared to me as often as I needed them. I never told anyone about them, until now.

I’m in prison. The closet is gone. In here, the only person looking out for me, is me. It’s another hostile, loud, irritating environment. I have to be vigilant, careful, selective, and at ease with associates. I do not trust many inmates. How could I? Many befriend, manipulate, lie, and deceive. They hypocritically defy the tenets of their monotheist religion. They loudly pray over state provided meals and then stuff their shirt or panties with stolen, state food. They claim to be Jewish and still gorge on pork skins or bacon. They claim to be Christian and still steal, lie, and sing in church right after orally swabbing the vulva of their girlfriend. It’s enough to make a wiccan like me cast my own spell of protection!

Time is a friend and an enemy. It holds us suspended in fleeting, happy, moments. It spins and replays the horror of an abusive childhood. We cannot go back in time to undo or relive any aspect of our existence. Like a mysterious shark swimming in the deep, dark, sea we must keep moving forward.
