**“Sobriquet… ‘Say What’” by Ed Slavin**

****Pronounced so-bri-q. It’s French and means fanciful name, but in America we call them nicknames. The world is full of these clever names and some have been legalized: 50 Cent, Sting, Madonna, Bono, Meat Loaf...Some are just nicknames: A-Rod, Sweetness, Cher, The Rock, Sinbad, Mr. T…

I live among convicts using nicknames that are commonly selected for toughness: J. Bone, Scuff, Killer, Slug, Psycho, Chopper, or Stone Cold. While some pick names as a description of themselves: Burn, Fatman, Slim, Nub, Shaky, Face, or Scar. And of course animal names are popular: Crow, Grasshopper, Wolf, Ant, Bird, Pony, or Bear.

A few of my friends have great nicknames: Biggie, who’s actually small; Butterbean, a twin to the boxer; Maniac, who’s quite calm; Turtle, just looks like one; Hillbilly, well, he really is; and Bumpy’s covered in lumps. It’s amazing to hear the variety of names in the cellhouse, at the chow hall, or on the yard.

Prisoners insist on using these humorous titles as if this **sheer cloak** will hide their real identity. Keep it real. My name is Ed and that’s what I go by, but Mr. Ed isn’t bad either.

Once, I called a fella at work by his real name...big mistake! He ripped into me saying, “My name is Knuckles, it’s always been Knuckles, everyone calls me Knuckles and you best learn that!” As he sat back down with his friends our supervisor approached and said, “Excuse me, Mr. Hertz, I need you to sweep the loading dock.” Knuckles rose with a look of shame and silently left the room.
