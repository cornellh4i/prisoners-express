**“Helping Out” by Cesar Hernandez**

****My wife and I went to see David Copperfield at the Hollywood Theatre. The price of ninety five dollars per ticket is well worth it. The theatre is somewhat small and only has about fifty small tables. My wife and I arrived early to get our table.

At our assigned table was a couple from Canada. They also arrived early. We were just starting to make small talk when one of David’s assistants came to our table. She asked the man if he would help David with a magic trick. He agreed and was taken backstage to be trained.

The woman and I were having a great conversation. My wife kept kicking me under the table. I bought my wife a drink and popcorn to keep her occupied.

The woman is a school teacher in Canada and her husband is an electrician. What fascinated me the most was that they chose to vacation during the ONE week where there is no snowfall. She said she was looking out the plane window and only saw an empty desert. The only thing you could see in the desert was the black road which was the highway.

Her husband came back from backstage. They would not tell him exactly what the trick was. They put penguin stickers on his shirt collar so David would know to pick him. They also told him not to catch the beach balls.

The show starts and all four of us at the table were waiting for David to need a person to help him out. With the beach ball trick we quickly batted them away from our table. Finally, David’s assistant is close to our table. The lights come up and David sees where he needs to end up. David goes all over the theatre looking for the perfect helper. He arrives at our table and asks the man if he will help him.

They both go up on stage. David has the man hold a large wooden bucket with a lid. David is holding a goose that is a stuffed animal. He tells the story of how he always wanted a real life goose. He puts the stuffed animal in the bucket and says the magic words. He tells the man to tip over the bucket. David says something is not right.. David tells the story again and puts the stuffed animal in the bucket. He says the magic words again and tells the man to tip the bucket over. A real live goose tumbles out flapping its wings and making noise. David picks up the goose and hands it to his assistant.

At our table, the three of us are waiting for the man to come back and explain how the trick was done. He was given an autographed photo of David Copperfield for helping him with the trick. He said he had no idea how the trick was done. He did not even know that a goose was involved. All they told him was how to hold the bucket and how to tip it over.

The rest of the show was great. David Copperfield does not disappoint. At the end of the show the Canadian couple asked if we would join them for drinks at Treasure Island. Before she even finished, my wife kicked me under the table. I politely declined and told her my wife and I had to get back to Bellagio since we had reservations at Le Cirque.
