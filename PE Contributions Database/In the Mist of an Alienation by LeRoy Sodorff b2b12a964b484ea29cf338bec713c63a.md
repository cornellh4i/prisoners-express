**In the Mist of an Alienation by LeRoy Sodorff**

Scarcely out of the woods, a lone silhouette seemingly stands frozen in time and space, after looking back at the hinterland towards the direction of a distant atrocity in the state of Misery. The tellurian safeguard of the deep rises en garde stoically, steadfast on the approach of a subterranean world while gophers, ferrets, weasels, moles, polecats, worms, louses, maggots and blackguards flee the devastation of the insidious cybernation.

With a chamberlain in squalor and many a room to tender, a slippery mole, with tunnel vision, rambles about, embedded in the depths, clothed in unearthly silence.

With the toxicity in the midst of a germination on the rise from out of the East, birds of a feather flock towards the forest station of the pacific Northwest. Old coots, gulls, loons, cardinals, babblers, tattlers, canaries, chickens, doves, hawks, and pigeons alike seek out the Long Beach and the moonshine. While gorillas, hogs, pigs, hounds, sows, wolves, nags, hell lions and vultures are put in cages. Sharks, grunts, crabs, clams, cheap skates, grunions, barracudas, chum, cutthroats, piranha and torpedoes disappear into the drink. Some choose the metropolitan, the cosmopolitan, the Geneva and the Manhattan.

With his Curious City in the state of Mass Confusion, the shrewd mole crawls his way through the intertwined passages, ahead of time. When he reaches the top, he squints and is blinded by the light. Off in the distance, he envisions the overwhelming intensity of an ill lumination.

Author’s Note: Please don’t blame the keyboardist for the typos here. There was a very shallow pool in which to choose from and right on cue, I was right behind the eight ball for a time. While the transcriptionist was a very rare type, I miscued by hitting the  railing with a resounding slap. Perhaps the typist could not read my chicken scratch because with all the JAVA here and being cooped up, this old Roaster with crow’s feet, is much too old to be up to scratch.
