**“Kids in Chains” by Mitchell Womack**

Save your kind words, your benevolent intentions, and your belated apologies.

Behind those words are unkind thoughts; your benevolent intentions took no shape or form; you’re only apologizing because you think that is what is expected of you.

Why are you apologizing? You aren’t sorry for what has happened to us. You don’t feel guilty, and you’re not ashamed of what your ancestors did.

Nor am I blaming you. Take your “sympathy” with you.

Look my way. You’re avoiding the truth. Truth is, you don’t see our accomplishments, our achievements, or how far we’ve come.

You don’t want to learn about our rich history. You only know of the slave trade on up. Nothing before.

We are people. We feel, we think, we see, we hear, we touch, we smell.

You don’t feel our pain; you don’t think we can see through your political correctness; you don’t see us as we truly are; you don’t hear our pleas; you’re not touched by our circumstances.

Maybe you should doubt your own humanity.

Tell the truth: this is how you have seen us, this is how you see us, and this is how you will always see us.

- Well take a picture, it’ll last longer!
