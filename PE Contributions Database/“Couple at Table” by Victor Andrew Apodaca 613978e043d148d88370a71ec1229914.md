**“Couple at Table” by Victor Andrew Apodaca**

Peek a boo who are you? Were you chained like brothers and dressed the same who the hell is your mother as we look the same, who’s dad? I ask if he says the same never met the bastard, he left us out in the rain. Who do you say that I am, is it true we are brothers and do you know who? That bastard slept with your mother and left once again so we are both bastards tied by this chain and the D.N.A is almost the same. Dear brother lets play in the dark, run down the street in the dark, mothers out smoking rocks and selling herself she doesn't care for nothing but herself I’ll look out for you if you look out for me we’ll get to play together when we’re older and go to the pen you and I are brothers chained down by life’s bad choices between men and women that started years back in that damn garden that old snake trick us again. Peek a boo I see you dear poor poor soul when we go to the pen no soul will care we’re just street trash chained together for whatever we never had a chance crack smoking momma and her little men….
