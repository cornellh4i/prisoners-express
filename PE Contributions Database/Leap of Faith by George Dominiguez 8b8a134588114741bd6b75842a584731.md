****Faith is by me, and I’m putting it to reality in the areas I need to believe. This is only believing in Jesus Christ. Faith comes by works of believing like healing, finances, marriage, and family. When I ask in faith, when I ask in God, to remove this fear and replace it with faith, I love. So I’ll put the word first. I meditate on the word so I’ll build my faith. I trust in my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, knowing that daily, I’ll grow more faithful. Also, I’m putting my faith in God, knowing that He will help me and bless me with the strength, courage, wisdom, and knowledge that I need to outgrow my fear. Because when I put Jesus as my developer of faith, I know He will develop it.
