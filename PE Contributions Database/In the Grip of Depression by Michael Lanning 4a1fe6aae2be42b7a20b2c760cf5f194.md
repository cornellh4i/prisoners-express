**"In the Grip of Depression" by Michael Lanning**

This engulfing darkness troubles me. Why are you being so cruel to me? I am so lonely in this bottomless darkness. So lonely. Lost. This darkness is haunted. I am afraid here. I am lost and afraid here. Have you no compassion? I only wanted to do good. To walk in the sunshine. To feel the winter snow against my skin, the summer breeze. To smell a flower, new-mown grass. To have a warm body next to me. Instead, I’m only two steps from the hangman.

This darkness extends to infinity in all directions, yet is confining as a coffin. You have closed me in a coffin. I have been buried alive. I am paralyzed and unfeeling but in torment, spiritually lacerated, at last emotionally broken on the hateful wheel of fate, no longer able to be brave, no longer able to hope or care. I feel terribly alone in a cold and hostile prison, and all I hope for now is death, emptiness, and at best, an end to all loss and grief.

What had been the point of existing? What had been the point of enduring all the life-saving operations that I had endured? Why had I been allowed to go on with life if it was all to end like this? What cruel consciousness lay behind the workings of the universe that it could even conceive of forcing me to struggle through a troubled existence that turns out, in the end, to have no apparent meaning or purpose?

My god, this can’t be living. Day in, day out; the monotony, the cruelty, the frustration. I pray, let me out, set me free, crucify me if you must, but put me out of my misery. I can’t do the same thing day in and day out until I die. Death would be welcomed as an acceptable release from the grip of my depression.
