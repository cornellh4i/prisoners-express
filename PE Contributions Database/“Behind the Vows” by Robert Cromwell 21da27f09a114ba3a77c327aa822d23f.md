**“Behind the Vows” by Robert Cromwell**

Priest:	“Do you take this woman to be your wedded wife; to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?”

Man’s thoughts:	“For better or worse: better sex, better food, better love, yay.  For worse: oh God I hope she doesn’t nag at me like her mother does her father. I suppose I could just go to the bar with my buds when she starts in. For richer, well yes, then she wouldn’t hound me for money to buy something dumb like she does - how many pairs of shoes does one person need? For poorer, I could take care of her and maybe she won’t leave. In sickness or in health, either way I’ll get to hold her body close to me. She has such a nice body - I wonder what she’s wearing under that dress.Death, now that’s a scary thought, I better not put her in my will just yet, maybe later.”

Man’s answer:	“I do.”

Priest:	“And do you take this man to be your wedded husband; to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?”

Woman’s thoughts:	“For better is always, well, better. For worse, that depends on how much worse; I suppose I could always get a divorce or maybe even have a man on the side. For richer - absolutely. For poorer, well maybe I could push him to make more money - a girl needs shoes ya know. In sickness, that won’t last too long. In health is good. Till death do us apart: well, I guess divorce is a type of death right? Death of a marriage. This could work.”

Woman’s answer:	“I do.”

Priest:	“I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

Priest’s thoughts:	“Just wait till you’ve been married forty years. Who am I kidding? I give it five max. If I hurry I can still catch the game.”

As they depart down the aisle:

Woman’s thoughts:	“Maybe he will give me a nice child. I could so do the mom thing.”

Man’s thoughts:	“Alright, almost sex time, I got a new position I’d like to try. I wonder if she would be interested in a threesome, her friend is so hot.”

The cans clatter behind the car to dispel the image of a perfect wedding.
