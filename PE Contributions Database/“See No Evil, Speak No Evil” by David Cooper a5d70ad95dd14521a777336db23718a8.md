**“See No Evil, Speak No Evil” by David Cooper**

This picture represents our society because we have become so politically correct that we only see and speak on the things that society views as important or non-offensive to others. We all see the bad and horrible things happening in this world, but we say nothing it it’s unpopular or goes against the popular view, no matter our own view. Activists and politicians scream that the United States treats terrorists, or suspected terrorists, badly, and that Guantanamo bay must be closed. But we have Americans abused, tortured, and even murdered in prisons, jails and the streets by the people hired to protect us. It seems that nowadays that only the traditional minorities matter. Christians, heterosexuals, and whites don’t have a right to speak their views. Houston University’s student body president Rohini Sethi was suspended for posting “All Lives Matter” on social media, but Memphis professor Zandria Robinson was hired by Rhodes College after denouncing whites and insisting that whiteness is most certainly and inevitably terror It seems to be that hate and prejudice has shifted, and the people fighting these things are the ones now fostering them. But this is never mentioned or acknowledged.

People who wanted the rebel flag banned supported the Black Lives Matter movement but have never said that their symbol of a black fist was like the symbol of Black Panthers, a radical political and racist movement. Nobody has said hey, thta symbol may represent the wrong thing, but they saw a flag that most people think of as a representation of southern or country pride.

Students made Clemson University apologize for its Mexican food nights. Bowdoin students pushed to sanction government officers who attended a fiesta thrown by a latino student. If one googles how many armed whites are shot and killed by police, this number doubles the number of unarmed black people. But I have not seen one case of these shootings on nightly world news.

Some states don’t allow nuns to wear their religious uniforms and teach school, but any Muslim teachers may wear their religious clothing. What used to be unpopular and a minority are now the norm and the majority, and all others are evil or the cause for all social injustice. Our President just pardoned several thousand people, most of whom were top level drug dealers. Though drug dealing is supposed to be a non-violent crime, they represent 70% of all people sent to state prisons.

In 2001, my mother was cuffed to a wall and raped by a Montgomery County Sheriff Deputy. This man admitted to the rape and apologized to my mother on the news. My mother spent longer in the ER getting a rape kit than he did in jail. This never made big news. A wrong is a wrong no matter what it is and who it happened to. All lives matter, and free speech should mean free speech for all, not for some.
