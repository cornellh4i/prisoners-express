**“Brother Can Ya Spare a Dime?” by Nate A. Lindell**

It’s been a lot of hard time for me, most of it in seg. I’ve had guys I stood up for, looked out for when they came in, steal from me, even write my then-girl, when it was safe to do so. Recently, I was literally stabbed in the back (of my head—the tip of the sword bent on my skull, preventing subsequent deep penetration) by some coward I’d helped. After writing seven lawsuits for guys at my last prison (G.B.C.I.), pissing staff off so much that they moved me into a shit-smeared cell and eventually transferred me here (the Columbia Corr. Inst.), some of the very guys I’d helped spread a rumor that I snitched to get out (if so, that’d make my suit about the retaliatory transfer frivolous…).

And then there’s the rotten shit staff have pulled and are pulling, often because I’ve spoke up for (in one way or another) prisoners who were being mistreated… usually ending in those prisoners disrespecting me in one or more ways, much of which I’ve wrote about on betweenthebars.org/blogs/540.

Prison’s just an extension from my childhood/“home.” My mom was seriously metally ill; I acted as her psych. nurse, even though it caused me physical pain, from the worry, and gutted my social life. Mom testified against me at my murder trial, was caught sleeping with a guy (he was in a ½-way house) I’d been in jail with the day before he told detecs I’d confessed to him, walked there with my mom….

Some will sneer, thinking “You a sucker, a ‘vic,’” believing I’m a fool for not eating dogs as dogs have tried to eat me.

What it really is is revolutionary and courageous, I choose to believe. It takes strength to continue to be someone who’s willing to help others and respect their human dignity even when they’re so unlikely to merely say “thanks.” The system’s inhumanity only thrives because so many *choose* to excuse its inhumanity: “He/she/it/they deserve it.”

I choose otherwise, and suspect that I can’t help it.

I *wish* I could’ve ignored my mom’s plight!

But I wouldn’t have been able to look at myself in the mirror.

A lot of people look at themselves in the mirror, shave, and manage to not cut their own throats in disgust… and the system is what it is.

Anyway, I don’t need a reward for *trying* to be decent (many times I’ve failed; blood I have spilt…), so I know that the same is true for others of you who similarly strive. Nevertheless, I thank Greg, for creating this should-be-award-winning forum; Dillon James Gresham, for the greatest compliment my art could have; James Bauhaus, for his critical wit forcing me to sharpen my own—“There can only be *one* highlander”; and Catherine LaFleur, for keeping us boys charmed.

I get help too, from a young woman in France who runs my Facebook and Instagram pages, from a Catholic priest who knows I’m an atheist (with horns tattooed on my head) and a Jewish neuroscientist who knows I have a swastika tattoo that I’ve grown out of. These three amigos can’t help but help too.

So, brother, and more-so sisters, if ya see me and need a dime. “Get yo’ hand *in* my pocket!”—it’s just a dime.
