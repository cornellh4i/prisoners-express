“Big City” by Cesar Hernandez

I grew up in a big city that had just over one million people living in it. I was used to seeing people everywhere, but had not really seen people packed so close that you can walk faster than you can drive.

I went to live in Las Vegas, Nevada for a while. I drove in and flew out which were too completely different experiences. I was used to people but not Vegas’s type of crowds. The city population always swelled from about 2 PM on Friday until 7 AM on Monday, when the weekend crowd left. Us locals knew to stay off The Strip during those times.

A local and a tourist are two completely different animals. They might see each other from a distance but they both stay in their respective territories. Most tourists never wander from Las Vegas Boulevard, and some locals have not ever stepped a single foot on The Strip. Most locals saw me as a tourist even though I lived there.

The Strip is an ostentatious world while the local scene can mostly be dreary and gloomy. Most locals hate tourists but love the tax dollars they generate. Some holidays can be extremely crowded while others completely empty.

The biggest crowd I saw was on Memorial Day. To drive from one end of The Strip to the other would take at least one hour. Everything was crowded. I could not understand how it was possible that McDonald’s never ran out of food when there was always about fifty people in line at all hours. The buffets were so full that they could not seat any more people. For every one person that left a buffet, they let in one person. On the Fourth of July, I expected the same, but the court was empty. The wait at McDonald’s was three minutes. Driving down The Strip took ten minutes.

The fashion show mall was on The Strip. It was always crowded. If you needed help from a salesperson it would be at least a ten minute wait. There was a mall about forty minutes away from The Strip. I went on a typical Saturday and it was empty. In the department stores, one basically would have had to send out a search party to find another customer. The food court only had about thirty people eating there.

On The Strip there was a movie theater with about twenty screens. Each theater held between 300-500 people. Most of the time, all the theaters were packed. Twenty minutes away from The Strip, there was a movie theater. It had about fifteen screens. Each theater only held between 100-300 people. Most of the time, there were at least fifty empty seats, so you could enjoy the movie without having to sit right next to a stranger.

When I moved out of Vegas, I flew out at the airport. There was an eight story parking garage five minutes from the airport that was full of rental cars. The whole garage only had cars from about ten different rental car companies, which include AVRS, Hertz, and Enterprise.

The airport was the size of a small city. From the entry door until the doors of the plane, it might’ve been a two mile walk. There was a monorail that takes you to different parts of the airport. It was always standing room only and packed to the fullest. A simple burger at a fast food place costed ten dollars yet the lines were always twenty minutes long. You could always tell the difference between the arriving and those departing. Those arriving were always excited, hoping to win big at the casino tables. Those departing were always sad that they lost a lot of money or went into loads of debt, because they didn’t have cash at the moment to gamble. The runways all had planes, both arriving and leaving. They looked like parking lots. There was always a line of several planes waiting to take off, one after another, only minutes apart.
