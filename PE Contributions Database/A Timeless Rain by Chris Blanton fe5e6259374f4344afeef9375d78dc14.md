***A Timeless Rain* by Chris Blanton**

I stand here motionless as these raindrops fall down around me, slamming into the ground like bullets slamming into my heart.

How could I have come back here, now, of all days? I’m flooded with such pain, for it was here in this very spot where I watched the lifeguards pull my brother’s lifeless body from the Atlantic.

My brother, Seth, was five years younger than me and only twelve at the time of the accident. Hell, he was just a kid. Damn, I keep seeing his reflection in these heavy raindrops. God, I miss him so much.

Why on earth did I come here today? Martha’s Vineyard was Seth’s favorite place because it was the simple things here that brought him the most happiness. Riding the old carousel, watching an osprey take flight, or just gazing at the gingerbread cottages, soaking up all their color, and attractiveness.

Seth used to look at me with his hypnotic eyes and say that Cape Cod was created just for him, and that it was his own magical playground. He constantly reminded his friends that the Cape was filled with wonder and life. Cape Cod was unique to Seth, just like he himself was unique, one of a kind.

I remember how we would get off the ferry in Oak Bluffs and look out over the island. Seth would spread his arms as wide as he could and say, “See Sis, it’s God’s great canvas.” Each new day here was one of God’s fantastic paintings to my brother.

Each year as we would cross over the Bourne bridge and finally arrive at the Cape, I would see Seth’s eyes light up. It was only then that I knew our summer could begin. He would look down from that great bridge into the canal below and just smile. God, he had the most amazing smile.

This place, Seth’s magical playground has always been such a big part of our lives and a reflection that defines who we are. But it did the unthinkable by turning its back on me by taking my little brother’s life! How can I continue to love it while hating it for what it took from me? The answer must be here, somewhere.

This mournful rain, the gloom. Oh why did I come, why Lord?

Wait! I don’t believe it. Out in the water, I’ve never seen them this close to shore. It’s a pod of whales! Seth loved the whales so much. He spent hours and hours watching them. These gentle giants of the sea were his best friends.

This must be my answer. God and my brother, together, painting me the picture I so desperately needed to see. The canvas is here in the middle of this timeless rain. I can feel Seth here with me. Everything is so clear now.

How could I have been so selfish, thinking only of myself and my feelings? This morning I questioned even getting out of bed. I saw only darkness and gloom in the falling rain. I almost turned around while driving along Route 28 to the dock in Falmouth. I even cried silent tears from my seat aboard the Island Queen, a ferry boat ride I normally hold dear.

I’ve made this island trip countless times, and despite my hesitancy to come today, I just knew I had to. Something was...different. Now I see that this was a gift, wrapped in a hidden blanket of beauty. I thought this trip would break me, but I was wrong. This canvas before me has instead renewed me!

I am comforted now, knowing my brother is safe--happy. This place he knew so well lives on; his wondrous playground will always exist. The proof is out there before me in the water, in these magnificent whales.

Had I stayed in bed today, the gift of the painting would have been lost, swept away with the churning currents of the Cape Cod Canal.

As these whales move off toward the unknown, I can now release this moment in time. I can let it go into the past, along with my pain. This moment is now a sweet memory belonging to Seth and me. That, in itself, is magical.

You know, this morning I saw this rain as bullets of pain, and now I see it as the soothing, joyful tears of my little brother falling from heaven, as if to say “Hey Sis, it’s okay.”

A timeless rain indeed!

I see the whales now, one last time, further out. They are breaching the surface playfully, vanishing from my view. Disappearing into the waters of…my Cape Cod, my new magical playground!

Thank you Seth, thank you God. I love you. Bring on the wonder, bring on the life. Happy thirteenth birthday little brother. God speed.
