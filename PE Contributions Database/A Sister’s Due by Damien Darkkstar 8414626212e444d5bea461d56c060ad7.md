**A Sister’s Due by Damien Darkkstar**

I have one person in my immediate family that I am truly proud of, my sister Jaymie.

My family is dysfunctional at best. My mom who at fifty years of hard living has finally decided to give up drugs and drinking (most likely by my sister’s intervention). Then there’s my oldest brother that I am sure is a borderline schizophrenic and has the worst habit of turning any situation he’s involved in into a (expletive deleted) storm.

Then there’s me, a derelict emo who is in prison for an untrue unfightable sex offence. Lastly, the youngest of us, my sister. She has started college and she has gone to nursing school, she also works full time at a credit union. She is an exceptional mother and wife (if her husband is to be believed :) ). She keeps us all in line, my mother and I especially. She pays my mom to babysit because she has no other source of income. Somehow she finds the time to talk to me on the phone at least once a week, she pays for that as well and because of this, I have literally been able to keep my sanity and not done anything I am terribly ashamed of.

Though I doubt any of us but me will admit it, but she’s our rock. She is a rockstar and I want everyone to know that at least one person in my clan who is actually a boss. She has had just a hard a life as the rest of us but she said “F you life. I will rise above.” So Jaymie I will say for all of us, we love you and without you our lives and the world would be an infinitely darker place.
