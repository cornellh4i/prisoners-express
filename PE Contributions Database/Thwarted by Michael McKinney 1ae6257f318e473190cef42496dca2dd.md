**Thwarted By Michael McKinney**

I really do feel thwarted is a very good topic to write on, concerning the situation I have been trapped in for so many years. To my understanding from studying the dictionary, thwarted means to prevent the occurrence of, realization or attainment of. And occurrence means something that takes place.

I have been in prison for so many years and I have been locked down in solitary confinement for so many years. Some call this kind of lockdown a close management unit, some call it a control unit, some call it max lockdown. It has been a big struggle for me not to let the prison system, and my one man cell lock down situation to break my spirit. Because each day the ones who work for this system, who don’t know any better, for years have been trying to psychologically cripple me and break my everlasting faithful spirit. The more the system sees they can’t do it, the harder they keep trying, because to this brainwashing system, I am very undesirable, especially to the new ways system. Little do they know that I have God on my side and I am always holding on to as much faith as I can. That is what helps me keep my head above the prison system waters. Each day I do all I can do to prevent this system from bounding my mind and spirit. My soul is never for sale. They can bound my body but never my spirit. My heart and soul belongs to God. In my situation, in some ways they are always trying to inflict all sorts of pain and suffering without using physical force to break my spirit. Just because I am locked up, doesn’t mean I have to give into something that is not right. The prison system that I have grown up in is a broken prison system.
