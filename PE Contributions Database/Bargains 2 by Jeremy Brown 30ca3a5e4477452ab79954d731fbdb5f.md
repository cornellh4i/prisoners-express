**Bargains 2 by Jeremy Brown**

As far as bargains go, the best bargain I found was on Craigslist in 2010, before I was incarcerated. I had to paint this doctor’s house and in return I got 2 huge 50-inch flatscreen TVs. I wasn’t doing it alone. I brought my 2 brothers and sisters along and we had a wonderful time just painting and joking around. Well the Tv’s had a bulb missing in each of them or the bulb was burnt out so we just ordered 2 $8 bulbs. 6 months later both TVs broke and we got rid of them. They were old big and bulky flatscreens, each weighing about 100 pounds. I guess it was worth it. SOmetimes you’ve got to take a risk.
