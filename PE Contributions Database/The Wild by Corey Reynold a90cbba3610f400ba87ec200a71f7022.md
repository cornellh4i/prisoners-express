***The Wild* by Corey Reynold**

Nothing can take what I’ve become. No other being in existence will ever be what I am or will ever conquer what I’ve overcome to get to this point in my life. I am the one and only king of my domain, my domain which is the wilds of the world. Where seldom a human foot touches, never do the atrocities of humankind dampen the natural order of my home. I am the dominator here in the vast emptiness of the wild, these meck animals that cohabitate with me here, cows at my passing. There is no animal in the forest where I call home that would fathom the challenge of a confrontation. I have utterly dominated every aspect of my world, from the pit up from which I came black from pole to pole, I thank whatever forces may be for my unconquerable soul. It matters not the challenge of however great the toll. I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.

Now, separated from my pack, along this desolate stretch of nothingness, I stand here and stare at this creature from another world. What is it? Where did it come from? What do I have to do to either make it leave or utterly destroy it? Will it try to harm me? Certainly not, it should realize from the talk of the wilds that I am king. I’m going to walk away from this creature of alien origins and forget I ever encountered it. Tell no one and it shall dissipate into distant memory. And then nothingness. But I am fixated upon the alien features of this creature, two legs, two arms, what appears to be unnaturally thick skin or fur, and this odd object that seems to be pointed directly at me. It’s not moving, but the wind is blowing directly at me and I catch a whiff of the creature. It smells of the worlds outside of the woods. Human. That’s the only possible things that could carry that stench upon itself. I cannot make a judgement as to its purpose this far out into the wild. In my territory.

My gut rumbles. The tangy taste of hunger fills my mouth. I think about the impending journey that will take me many miles back to my home territory and back to my pack. Food. That is why I left the safety of the others to begin with, but now I’ve wasted too much valuable time evaluating this alien being that rarely ventures out here. I have to go now, stranger from another world.

Perhaps we may continue this odd encounter another time, but for now I must return to my pack. I have much word to do before I return or else the others will be very disappointed in me for not bringing home food. Why I’ve been nominated the sole wolf for this job is beyond my mind. Is it not usually a group effort? At times a great bonding experience for mother wolves and their pups.

I must return now odd creature.

Until next time...
