**“Raised in Chains” by No One**

Cursed to be born

Beautiful, poor, and female‑

There are none that suffer more

‑ Perry Farrall

She never had a chance.

The first link in the chain was homelessness. Maybe not living on the street. But she had no stable ground‑ it always shifted, from day zero.

“Las Vegas,” she told me. “Then Seattle. Then Japan. Um, lots of airports. Christ. I don’t remember. Back to Vegas. Then Oregon. Then finally here.”

Here, Alaska, when she was twelve. I met her a couple years later. She told me everything. Matter-of-factly, like she was someone else she barely knew.

“He wasn’t always like this,” she said, “he” meaning her father. “This” meaning absent. Maybe not physically gone. But cold and distant. Occasionally mean. Working too much. Absent. The third link in the chain.

Oh, what was the second?

“He used to LOVE me,” she said, putting a little too much honey on the word. She even winced slightly, like the word tasted funny. “You wouldn't believe the kinds of clothes he bought me. This thong? Yup. He bought me this.”

I can’t even tell you link four. It’s actually a whole fucked-up series of links, long and tangled enough to make me lose count. And I’m not allowed to talk about it. But worse, much worse, is that SHE’S “not allowed” either. Maybe not because she’ll be punished by prison guards, but by society. Social recoil‑ or unwelcome prurience. A family that would rather not rewind explicit scenes. The dirt has long been safely swept under the bed. Further links in the chain.

“I like calling you ‘Daddy,’” she murmured, licking my mouth. I kissed her back, intoxicated. By her beauty, by idvenous lust, by the egomania of being her surrogate God. Intoxicated as in poisoned, as in the body feels good, but the mind is sick.

“I love you,” I said, and meant it, but it doesn’t absolve me. I was the next link in her chain.

I study the prostitutes. Not dispassionately. But soberly. One cocks a hip, in an expert pantomime of provocation. The chains are long. She never had a chance.

That’s my girl!
