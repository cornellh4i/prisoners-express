**“Lust leads to Greed” by Xavier Osborne**

I was sitting in the outdoor patio of a cafe picking at a funnel cake as I sipped my frappuccino. I was sketching some photos from pictures requested by a few friends when I looked up and saw a young man, walking hand in hand with a girl, turned around for a second and looked toward another woman. His girlfriend turned him toward her and slapped him. The few people that were at the cafe around me and looked up just as she yelled out, “You are a jerk!”

She stormed off, leaving the kid dumb-founded. He looked around to see if anyone was watching. Others continued to do what they were doing, but I kept my eyes on him. His sun-kissed beach tan skin turned red as his blood began to boil with anger. His hazel blue eyes locked with mine as he sped walk toward me. His voice was of England dialect as he spoke in an aggressive tone, “You eyeballing punk?!”

Not wanting to arouse him any further, I offered him a fresh funnel cake and said, “How about you sit and enjoy this cake, son.” His medium, thick, brown eyebrows flared up with confusion as he took a seat. I could see the hurt emitting from his eyes and jittery hands. He didn’t want to fight; after all, I would have won.

“What’s your name, kid?” I asked.

“Jace,” he replied.

“Well Jace, do you know the difference between lust and greed?”

“I have an idea, but no, I don’t know.”

“Answer A: Lust is like a thirst or a want that you know you can’t have. Answer B: greed is the evolution of lust. Your want becomes an action, and like dominos, you move on to the next one and so forth.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“What you did to that girl was flat out full of greed. Had you not taken that second look, you and your girlfriend would have been walking through the French Quarters.”

“So what are you saying, Mr. Love Expert?”

“I’m saying: be a better man to her and whoever you have in your family. Show them that you can be the bright young man that you know you are. Step up and don’t be afraid.”

“So how do I get Lisa back?”

I laughed and said, “That, my friend, is a lesson for another time.”

I picked up my coffee, said, “Enjoy the cake; it is phenomenal,” and disappeared in the tourist crowd.
