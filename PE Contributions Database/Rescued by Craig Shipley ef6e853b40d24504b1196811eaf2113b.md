I have heard many people say they were not arrested, but rescued. I myself would fit into that category as well.

I am 5’11” and weigh about one hundred eighty-five pounds. When I was arrested back in 2009, I may have weighed 150 pounds, if I was lucky. Meth and crack really did a number on me. What is really sad is that I was only out about seventy days. I did a little over three years and stayed out seventy days, only to come back with twenty-two years, eight months at 85%. Rescued, huh?

Yes, I was definitely rescued. Rescued from myself and the drugs that I was doing just to feel “normal”.

Today I feel “normal” being sober. On 4-10-16 I had seven years clean. I’ve had plenty of opportunities to use in here, for free even. Sometimes I really would like to escape this place for a while, but I turn to music or pen and paper instead of drugs.

My freedom has been somewhat rescued. Of course I am in prison, but my freedom from active drug use has been achieved. I do not know about tomorrow, but today I am not planning to use. That is being rescued to me.

I have rescued my mama from having to worry if she will get a call saying I overdosed or got killed. I have rescued my loved ones and friends from having to tell me I cannot come to their home because they do not want me around (I may rob them blind). I have rescued some of the broken relationships I had and mended them pretty well.

Of course I do not like being in prison, but being rescued is a whole lot better than the alternatives.
