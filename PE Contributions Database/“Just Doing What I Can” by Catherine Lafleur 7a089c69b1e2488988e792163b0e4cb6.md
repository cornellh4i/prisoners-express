**“Just Doing What I Can” by Catherine Lafleur**

In my job at the Law Library, I have the opportunity to help people every day. I deal with criminal and civil law and also administrative and medical grievances. Sometimes, I am just making it up as I go along. Not only do I have the opportunity to help others, but I have the same opportunity to ask for help from my co-workers: Kenya, Yvonne, Teah, and Yogi.

They have varied experience and can usually direct me if I am off course or uncertain. In truth, as iron sharpens iron, so can we learn from each other’s mistakes and successes. There has always been an environment of inclusivity and cooperation at the Camp Prisoner Land Law Library. My past co-workers have included: Sarah (the Federal Guru), Juicy (the creator), Shanna, the Venerable Theresa, Paula, Frieda, Courtney S., and Terry, along with a host of others. There are also many other law clerks I am indebted to in prisons such as Pelican Bay, San Quentin, Arizona State Prison, The Texas Department of Corrections, and Florida State Prison who have provided advice on difficult Federal problems and thorny Constitutional questions through corresponding with me. I won’t call any names; they know who they are. Thank you for your patience because you can imagine how long it takes to get a letter to and from Camp Prisoney Land. Smoke signals or a psychic connection would probably be faster.

My modest success rate is due to cooperation and advice from these excellent law dogs. And I have had successes. The downside is that of my successes, ninety percent have gone on to kill themselves in one way or another. Drug overdoses, alcohol poisonings, DUI deaths, a hanging, a sliced wrist suicide, and others. I guess the one who died from cancer doesn’t count. So even though I opened the door for legal relief, have I really helped the situation? I am not responsible for them, but, still, I am feeling some kind of way about it all.

The upside of the job is that I get to help the people living in the SHU. Mostly these are short time SHU people. Camp Prisoney Land is just a holding facility on the road to longer confinements at the prison upstate or a placement in the Therapeutic Community Unit. Essentially, I help these people with administrative matters, making sure the Florida Administrative Rules are followed and the pooh-bahs have dotted all the I’s and crossed the T’s.

Occasionally, I do get an inmate who is living on Ultima Thule (pronounced Too-lee), the farthest object in our solar system orbiting the sun only every three hundred years. In other words, the lights are on but no one is home. This inmate will insist on filing motion after motion, or alternately, grievance after grievance with claims such as “I am a citizen of Mars and Earth has no jurisdiction over me.” Fine, if I can’t talk them down from their lofty perch, I will type that motion or grievance for them, as long as they sign the disclaimer that I advised them against filing the action. You wouldn’t believe how thick that file in the boss’s office is. Or maybe you would. No need to call names, you know who you are.

I just do what I can. And so often I can’t do a darned thing, other than make my rounds on Sunday, forcing you to get out of bed, and checking to see if you are brushing your hair and your teeth and reporting my findings to the appropriate friendly parties.
