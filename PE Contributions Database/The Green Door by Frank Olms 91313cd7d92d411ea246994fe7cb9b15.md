**The Green Door by Frank Olms**

I’d been on the road since four this morning -- heading West. I’d seen the shadows change as they move across the ground while still firmly anchored to their source.

The landscape had transformed from green farmland with trees to sparsely fertile land to desert with agave cactus shadows twice as long as they were tall, and now the shadows were only a memory.

I’d turned on the radio a few hours earlier when I stopped to refuel. A song was coming from the speakers I hadn’t heard in years -- I couldn’t remember the name, and I couldn’t forget the verse: “there’s an eyeball peekin’ through a smoky cloud behind the green door!” And now I couldn’t get the verse out of my mind. I repeated the verse in my mind. I knew I needed some rest, but I had entered into no-mans land. That last cactus I saw was as lonely as I was beginning to feel. I hadn’t seen any signs of life in hours.

In the distance I saw the shape of a building, a motel -- out here? There were, maybe, ten or twelve units. Small. As I turned onto the dirt dive, another vehicle was just leaving. It was almost eleven o’clock. There were two other cars in front of two units and an eighteen wheeler parked along the roadside.

I went into the office and rented a room. The clerk handed me the key and said. “Welcome to the Green Door, unit thirteen.”

Green Door? The verse from the radio came racing back into my mind. I thought I counted only twelve units. I walked to the last unti and went in. Unit Thirteen. A double bed, two end tables, and a four drawer bureau furnished the room, a door to the bath and another door… it went nowhere, screwed to the wall, with no hinges and no handle, but a keyhole -- a strange “ESS” shaped keyhole. The door was painted green!

I was too tired to contemplate the possibilities. I laid down on the bed, and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up a few minutes later and had the eerie feeling of being watched. I looked about the room for some surveillance equipment -- a camera or anything, but saw none. But still --

A slight, dim glow was coming from the door … no it was coming ominously from the keyhole -- WHAT!?!

I did not put on the light, but crept silently across the floor toward the green door. As I raised myself up, I was astonished to see, through the “ESS” shaped keyhole, “an eyeball peekin’ through the smoky cloud behind the green door” Far out man.
