**"Tired of Running" by Colin VanBilliard**

As I sit in my hut as the war broke out, I stay with six family members. It is a very poor village, but we are very bonded together. It is all work. Walk to the stream to get water. Wash the rice. Women wash clothes. We believe in Yoruba. This is our culture and our life. We have clashed with bands of radicals. I have a machete to protect my family. It has been passed down. I’m American and Nigerian. I never met my father. He was one of them, tourist people. As I look out my door I see people running. People chasing people and families with hatchets. They ran right by. I guess I’m safe.

I grab my pen and write what I’ve seen. I, Colin VanBilliard, lay on this dirt floor of this hut as blood from my people runs through our soil. When is it going to stop? Why kill? They ain’t trying to take our village. They are just killing us. Why? I wonder if I had one of them American guns if I could take one of their lives. And if I could, could I live with it? Family after family killed and I lay and I just lay and write.

Then a little girl runs in the door, out of breath. She said she wants to come in and needs something to drink. So I give her some fresh water and ask the young girl, who had to be about five years old, what her name was. She said Black Diamond. She said that they killed her family. I’ll get them, wait and see.

“What are you doing?” Black Diamond asks, seeing me writing.

So I read her some of the stuff I wrote.

Little Black Diamond fell asleep so I wrapped her in blanket and wrote my book, “The Life of Black Diamond”. I took care of her and taught her. To work out she would go to the extreme. Her and her two friends formed G Unit. They fought against attacks on women and villages. She was no ordinary person. It was in her heart. Black Diamond and the G Unit girls--they loved to stay strong and fight.
