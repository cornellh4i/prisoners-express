**Thankful by Bobby Ball**

I’m up early in the morning

Visualizing exercising me against the world pounding through the speakers

Is it me or is it misery manifesting my min with mysteries

Murderous Mentality Methods

Mandatory that we mash on

Never Judge the Exterior cuz its the interior that Really Counts

Kiss the sun for My Ancestors

Suffocate a Rainbow turn it into Liquid Pour it out Never Sip it

That’s how it is in this Lifestyle

A society Manufactured by Multiple Minds for the Means of Money

Speak the truth and they hate you

Can you Imagine the pain Hate and Emotions that Created that D.N.A

Deep & its Simple Emotional Intelligence is so Relevant

Because Karma is Created its not Imaginary

Close Yo Eyez and place Yo self in Your Paradise

but know it’s Temporary Never Permanent

Don’t give a damn what they think about me

Remove my Heritage & History & where would they be

Thankful

Everlasting episodes erupting rapidly

Exterminating all uncomfort & its totality

Memories of you accompanied with excitement energizes my existence

What once was has become foreign

With a dose of pain

Archives my actions

Authentic apologies articulated in ink

With the strength of my ancestors

Tames the temperature in which I reside

Free from the shackles of immaturity?

Hard work affords much respect

On bending knee for one last hug & kiss

With the permission to have your undivided attention

To look into your

Eyes

With courage and compassion

To say

“Thank you”

For being the reason & the one

For the re-creation of me

“Thankful”
