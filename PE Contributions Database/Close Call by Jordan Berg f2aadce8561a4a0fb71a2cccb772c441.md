**Close Call by Jordan Berg**

Everybody has had a close call. Young, old, big and small.

They’ve happened to us all. This one changed my life.

My Grandma and Grandpa’s anniversary fell on a Saturday so I decided a nice brunch at our favorite wayside restaurant we frequented growing up prior to camping would be an unexpected treat from me. Their wayward grandson. Except it almost didn't happen.

I wanted to be close-by in the morning so I decided to sleep on my pickup’s bench seat, then head to the campground from home. It was only an hour’s drive, but only 20 minutes from the wayside. On the drive over, I got a phone call from my best friend Cory that I hadn't spoken with in a couple of years.

Cory said he was thinking about me and was curious what I was up to. I explained my plans for Grandma and Grandpa and he’s been to the campground so he knew how to get there.

Curious where I was, I told him. He said he was nearby at a small party and told me to come by. What the hell. It's been a long time since I've seen him, so I put the address in my GPS and drove over. Turns out he was about 15 miles away.

What a wild night that was. At about midnight we heard sirens and went out front to investigate. The sight In front of us was absurd.

A man presumably intoxicated was on a riding lawn mower driving down a country road with a long gun laying across his lap, followed by a painfully slow procession of brightly lit squad cars following like a mother duck chicks.

That was enough for me. I was 18 and shouldn't have been drinking, so I hit the road seeing all the cops were going in the opposite direction with the redneck hot wheels. I was blasted!

On the way to the wayside, I drunkenly fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the center line In front of a very attentive trucker who blasted his air horn waking me up. I pulled over turned the CB on apologized to the trucker and also thanked him.

True fact-most accidents happen close to the intended destination. Mine was no different. My blood pressure never should have been as high as it was that night. In my truck I rolled down the window, took a couple deep breaths, lit a smoke and drove to the wayside parking lot. It took me forever to calm down. Scared the hell out of me. Talk about a close call. I will never drink and drive again.

The best part was having that anniversary brunch with my beloved grandparents. If only they knew how close the brunch came to not happening, when they had no idea It was gonna happen. I was incarcerated soon after.
