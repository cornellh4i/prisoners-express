The picture of man trying to hide his eyes from seeing reality of the world, yet the world still is there, in stark reality, no matter where you try to hide.

This is so much a symbol of much of the American society’s personality disorder in the twenty-first century. We as a society at large, try to avert our eyes from the stark reality of life in America.

We hide our eyes from seeing a race problem, when we witness racism daily. We see classism too. Yet we put on blinders and rose colored glasses, then pretend that we personally do not hold such bias, nor its presence in our communities. Just look at the murdering of persons of color by law enforcement. Both white America and upper classes never see it as a national disgrace. Instead, they spout it was just criminals who deserved what they got. It took us social advocates of “all” races and classes to make it a well-known fact of murder by state actors.

Now let’s look at the prime example of hiding our conscience from blatant facts concerning our presidential candidates. Both have flaws. Yet one lived under a microscope of dirt digging by her political opponents, yet so little dirt stuck. Advocates do endure mud slinging. Yet you have on the opposite side, a glaring-certified hate mongering racist with severe egomaniacal tendencies who claims purity while wearing bloodstained hooded white robes. To hear his supporters, this narcissist with a messiah complex really is the savior of the American WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant).

Yet as the eyes still can see the world despite hiding the eyes, we as a nation know we are only fooling ourselves, but reality just is too fearful to bear at this time. So we sleep in a false security that the America we know yesterday will still be the same tomorrow. Well that is a pipe dream so wake up and smell the coffee. Our nation is forever changed.

I challenge you today, to start looking around and truly seeing this world for what it truly is. Then change it for the better.
