****I wish to speak of not taking the leap of faith when you actually know in your heart and soul that you should. I look in hindsight toward weeks before my present incarceration. I was engaged to a beautiful, hardworking Liberian woman named Marion who had a firm belief in God. She also had faith in me, never judging me on my past and known prior behaviors like how God teaches.

I was struggling with finances at this time, not because I wasnâ€™t working and making excellent wages. It was due to recent surgery for Marion after which I assumed responsibility for her care while she healed. I ended up becoming overwhelmed and stressing both her and myself. This led to many poor decisions with myself as I started staying out to hang with old friends.

This, in turn, found me incarcerated in Pennsylvania on minor charges. As part of my release, I had to turn myself into Maryland Authorities for a probation violation based on the Pennsylvania charge. As this happened, I lost my job, my COL was suspended due to not paying a traffic ticket, my car was repossessed for missing payments while incarcerated in Pennsylvania, and I lost financing for my first home intended for Marion and myself.

With heavy burdens, I travelled to her mother's house where she was living to face heavy decisions. Marion spoke to me that we could overcome all our new difficulties, even if she had to walk to employment.

First, I had to deal with Maryland Authorities. She prayed for me to take a leap of faith and rely on God. I argued against her, telling her that once I turn myself into Maryland Authorities, she would not see me again--that despite her belief in God, Maryland would not accept my mistake in Pennsylvania because of my long history.

Time and time again she begged me, but instead, I looked at my shortcomings in not taking care of her and our present state of need. I made a decision to provide her money through robberies I was planning before I was reincarcerated in Maryland. I could not place my faith in God.

Of course, none of my plans worked out. I never was able to send money to her and was eventually reincarcerated in Maryland for numerous felony charges. As they were being adjudicated, I went for my violation of probation where I was facing about 17 years.

I walk in the courtroom where my attorney had already worked out a plea. I was to receive only 5 years due to paperwork errors. I was stunned. I committed numerous felonies which contributed to the 5 year plea, but had I listened to Marion and taken that leap of faith, I may have ended up with far less or even reinstated on probation.

It took me a long time to admit this to her and myself. I believe that on that day, I was shown the difference between not taking a leap of faith and making my own choices.

My felonies overrode the 5 years, and my total sentence ended up to be 20 years. I never hesitate to speak about this time, and I recommend to others to take a leap of faith. In most things, I now look to my Creator who I do not specify under any specific faith. God represents all of us.
