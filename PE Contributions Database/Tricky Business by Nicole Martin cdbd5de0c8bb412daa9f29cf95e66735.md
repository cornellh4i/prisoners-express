**Tricky Business by Nicole Martin**

She was that wild thing I loved, my dark between the stars as I walk through the streets in need of you. I know this is tricky business that I have to do, you see as much as i try to push you away. It seems like I find you in the midst of day. See Tricky Business you’re not very nice I don’t even think of myself once or twice, what you are doing to me on the outs is no good see, Tricky Business I need to go out without you by my side you see, I need to be happy but you always make me sad so tricky business I want to give you up, because If I don’t I will never get back up, the hurt that you are causing can never go away unless tricky business you leave and you stay away. See you have caused so much hurt and dismay the way that you play makes my kids stay away when all they want is mommy to come and to play, so tricky business, It’s time for you to go because it’s almost time for mommy to come home
