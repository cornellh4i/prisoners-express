**by Brad Perkins**

30 years ago I took a wrong turn and got lost. I ended up in situations and places that I wouldn’t have been able to imagine when I made that decision way back in the 1980’s.

I had no business going off the path like I did. I was too young to make such to make such weighty decisions and had no idea the repercussions that would follow. I had loved ones try to guide me away from my decisions, but they were lost in their own journeys then too.

I would pop up in somewhat familiar ground from time to time during these lost years, but I no longer felt I belonged, so I was even lost when I was at my former home with those closest to me. It even got to the point where I was lost inside of myself, not recognizing the thoughts that came to my mind or the depraved actions I participated in.

Now a stranger looks back at me when I look into the mirror, an old man who looks something like a much aged (and abused) version of the kid who used to be me all those years ago.

It is still a little early to know for sure, but I don’t think I am lost anymore. I think I have managed to finally pick up enough pieces of who I used to be in this jumbled, over run jungle inside of my mind to be that guy who used to stay on the right path and not get lost in the scary dark places life has to offer those who stray.
