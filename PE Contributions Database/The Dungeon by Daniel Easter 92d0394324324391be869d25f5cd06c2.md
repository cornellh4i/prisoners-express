**"The Dungeon" by Daniel Easter**

The wizard's dungeon didn’t look like much from the outside, with its small enclosure surrounded by the sea. The tiny island wasn’t much either, with only a single tree spanning behind the dungeon. The crows served as the wizard's eyes and ears over his realm.

Anyone who displeased the wizard quickly found out what the inside of that dungeon was truly like. No one ever emerged to reveal the horrors of that magical prison, save the wizard's nemesis, Sir Walter Mason, a Paladin from the southern kingdom. And he barely lived long enough to tell the tale.

It was ten years ago, this New Moon, when the Paladin staggered out from the dungeon and found me. My name? It's not important. Don't want the wizard to know I know the truth. After all, I'm only a peasant farmer, not a Paladin.

Here's what he told me:

My magic was no match for what I found there. The undead alone, zombies, ghouls, and vampires were no match for my strength and the god's holy aura. Even the magical traps couldn’t deter me. My shield held off the ogres and trolls that roamed the deepest reaches of that hole.

Then, I met the master himself. His first attack was one that staggered me. He pummeled me with his fireballs and sonic arrows. Then, came the death curse, that dread spell that turns mere men into walking corpses. But, I turned that spell, sending the wizard retreating. I countered with a mighty sweep of my Holy Mace, then a thrust with my faithful Bastard Sword.

The wizard's second attack came as I freed a small man who may have been a halfling, or maybe an imp. This time, he overwhelmed me with his undead. Yet, I either turned the hell spawn or attacked them with my holy symbol. That was when the wizard devised my downfall.

As I fought a particularly nasty ghost who was trying to chew off my sword hand, I felt an icy chill creep up my spine, like the god himself had touched me. In fact, he had. That crazed spell caster had overloaded my symbol with dark magic so strong that the deity thought me dead.

So as I tell you this, good fellow, my deity calls me to his most holy temple. I leave this tale as a reminder to all those who seek to oppose the wizard. Death awaits those who defy him.

After burying the Paladin, a strange sight appeared in the sky above the dungeon. A star, bright as the sun, shone over the dungeon. No one has seen the wizard since that star began to shine.
