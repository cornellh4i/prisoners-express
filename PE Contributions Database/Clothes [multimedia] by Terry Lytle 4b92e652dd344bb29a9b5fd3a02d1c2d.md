**Clothes [multimedia] by Terry Lytle**

I just got some new clothes… all made by prisoner-slave labor… Kinda has me wondering, what’s really owed? Or sold?

I mean, here’s an example: I got a new 3X tee, but as a t-shirt it doesn’t really fit me. It’s too big… long… sleeves below the elbows.

And here are my new thermals: 5X top. Kinda loose, kinda “hot” - you know, “cool” - starting my own fad. Same color, same Correction Enterprises tag.

Yo! My 4X thermal bottoms… just right, not too tight (you know it’s a lot of luggage in there… my tools need air…)

And the pants, 36-40 tag, with side-mounted adjustable straps. Something like on camo or military exercise pants… only one thing, it’s plastic on nylon. Wear out real quick in the yard… so, adjust… with your time.

Me? I got two dimes: been all the way up to 41-45 (that’s an extra large) but then I got bagged for a jack (that’s a phone) and starved. It just ain’t cool, losing your cell or your machine, when it’s “business as usual:” jailhouse snitch, had me in their perusal.

Now, how about my washcloth: straight from Pakistan (no lie!). But I thought we was at war? With the likes of the internet, I just don’t know anymore. About my towel and that tag… I’m sorry I couldn’t find that and send it too. But it was straight from Afghanistan, and I’m not trying to bullshit you!

So? What’s a man to do when prison is contrary to the news? And this is just my clothes! Wait till next month, when I tell you about my food (and my shoes)! Why, one’s from China and the other is from Vietnam! And nobody believes me - worst of all? My mom!
