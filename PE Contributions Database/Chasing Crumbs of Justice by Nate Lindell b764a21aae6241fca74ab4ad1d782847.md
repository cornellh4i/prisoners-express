**“Chasing Crumbs of Justice” by Nate A. Lindell**

****Those of us who have felt the iron heel of America’s “justice” system know well what a sham it is. We know how hypocritical politicians are when they criticize other nations and their leaders for oppressing their citizens. Yet those who have never been caught in the mortar and pestle of our law-enforcement and judicial system are often blinded by the show put on by the established powers. The show maintains their audience’s loyalty, deceiving even the skeptical into chasing after crumbs of justice via lawsuits and appeals which only a lucky few ever taste.

Over 1,500 lawsuits have been filed against or concerning staff in my prison, Wisconsin supermax. As far as I know, only five of these resulted in prisoners winning money and as probably the most litigious prisoner here, I know about most of the litigation going on, as I am behind it.

This illusion of justice is especially elusive when it comes to prisoners begging for their civil liberties or rights or freedom from unlawful convictions, things the rich and powerful take for granted. Our first black president, who caused the massive and dehumanizing incarceration of black people and white collateral slaves such as myself, ensured such justice would only be an illusion when he signed into law the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) and the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) which inspired states such as mine to enact their own versions of those laws, further obstructing out potential access to justice.

One obvious example of the unjustness of the PLRA is that it denies illiterate and insane prisoners the ability to file lawsuits about abuse. They must first properly exhaust the prison’s grievance process, which neither are capable of doing. It is exactly those vulnerable prisoners who are most likely to be abused. (See reports of abuse at Waupun Correctional Institute by Bill Lueders on [http://www.wisconsinwatch.org](http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/), at other WI prisons on [http://www.prisonforum.org](http://www.prisonforum.org/).)

Then judges have their own agendas, prejudices, interests which makes fairness a myth, especially in states like mine, where judges are elected. The only rights we have in such courts are those the politician on the bench thinks will be popular. So, good luck to the black guy in the rural county accused of blank or the slow, poor white kid who was easily manipulated into (falsely) confessing his involvement in a rape and murder with his uncle. Written out, it seems ridiculous that either would get justice because it is ridiculous.

The only reason that Brendan Dassey got justice from a federal district court after three levels of state courts upheld his frame is because *Making a Murderer* persistently exposed the injustice of his conviction. The wizards of Oz couldn’t close the curtain on his case. He got lucky.

In my own murder case, it seemed that a new trial dropped in my lap when the judge refused to remove from the jury pool a woman who said she was “close friends” with the victim for over twenty years. Because the judge did not strike her I was effectively denied one of the seven strikes guaranteed to both me and the D.A., making the jury selection process unfair. This was a “structural error” that Wisconsin’s supreme court had recently ruled required a new trial.

Six times within three years after my conviction Wisconsin’s supreme court affirmed its decision that the error automatically required a new trial. Given that the judge in my case previously acknowledged how hard it would be for me to find impartial jurors, and then adamantly refused to remove one so obviously incapable of being impartial, for sure I would get a new trial...you would think.

The doctrine of stare decisis mandates courts abide by their prior decisions and I have seven decisions in three years on my side. However, I also had recently elected Wisconsin supreme court justices that were not on my side but rather, on the side of prosecutors who had been crying about having to give defendants fair trials.

Hence in State v. Lindell 629 N.W.2d 223 (Wis. 2001), the slimmest-possible majority crafted a forty-plus page explanation for overruling its seven prior decisions. (Shortly after this decision the attorney who argued my appeal, Timothy Gaskell, was elected D.A. of the county neighboring the one I was convicted in.)

Sure, I was guilty. But I was also framed.

I continued chasing the crumbs of justice. From the moment I entered prison I began studying law, both criminal and civil. When my frame was affirmed, I began practicing it by challenging and beating the “obviously unfair” discipline that caused me to be sent to Wisconsin’s supermax. Then I challenged, beat and got A.A.G Richard Victor sanctioned for frivolously defending the discipline supermax staff concocted to try to justify keeping me here.

But I couldn’t swim above the deluge of discipline they then buried me in (for petty, non-violent misconduct like calling a guard a “pig”) and used to justify keeping me here.

I almost beat my murder conviction.

I almost beat my transfer to this supermax.
