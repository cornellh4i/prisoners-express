**“Outside, Looking In” by Terry Lytle**

So...you’re probably wondering why I’m sitting here, staring out upon the “big city.” First, it doesn’t scare me--not much does. I’m from Phoenix...Arizona...so, who needs the clouds, right? Give me the sun shining, any day, over a gloomy grey. The “big city”--yeah, right.

I don’t “do” high heels--hence, the boots. They give me a couple of needed inches--my brother’s six foot. That’s who I’m “waiting” for...not that he’s gonna just “fly up.” He’s in prison...writes for Prisoner Express at times...been gone, most his life in there. Doing 25.5 years, now…

It’s more like, “remembering.” You know “re”-building good thoughts, and ideas, and dreams about a “member” of my family. Some call it...reminiscing, or looking back. Even though he’s my little brother, he was always acting like a big brother...until the drugs. Yeah, the drugs…

The crime didn’t get him-the drugs did. He was working like a grown man since he was eleven, twelve years old. It’s ironic, though...a drug dealer, as a drug user. Sound familiar? Made more money working.

I hope he likes my hair. I’ve changed it a lot over the years. But I decided to go back to my old style...he said it makes me look young again. I think he’s full of shit, but I changed it anyway. Even though he’s a little smart-ass...he knows things...not.

Like, how life seems troubling- but it’s just our thoughts about life, mostly. And how people have motives, that’s just life. But not all people have bad motives. Plus, he hurt me like the sumbitch he is, when he wouldn’t walk me down the aisle at my wedding (who knew where our dads were), but he was right: my ex-husband wasn’t shit. Hell, he was cheating in a redneck bar with a trailer park tramp the night I was giving birth to our daughter. Damn near, one year anniversary...Not even a year and my marriage blew all to hell. He knew. Somehow…

But my brother, he understood my stay. Not much longer! Mind you. But I did stay...Even so, he was there--what he was mindful of, anyway. The drugs, remember?

Anyway, I’m thinking of mailing this, you know: “Outside, Looking In.” I’d be OK with that. And I know! He’d get it. I’m sure of it. I know, I didn’t say much. But that’s OK...By the way, I’m “Cowboy’s” sister, Toni.
