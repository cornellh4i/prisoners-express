**“Lazy Days" by Joshua Balistreri**

It’s days like this one that we live for. Days filled with ease and relaxation. Days where the most difficult part of it is when it ends. Life is punctuated by moments like these. The sweet, blissful moments of job, and time spent with our families.

Each week we work our hands to the bone. Struggles with coworkers, battles with our bosses, and the pressure to meet deadlines. We sacrifice time at home for time at the office, or more overtime at the shop. And for what? At times we get caught up in the rush of it, and it’s easy to feel it’s all for nothing. Then we finally get a chance to simply slow down and enjoy the day, and we come to the realisation that this, this moment of peace, is what we do it for. And suddenly all our strife seems worth it. In these brief instants we see the true meaning of life.

As I lay here in this hammock, looking up at the sky, and notice my wife smiling at me, our little girl quiet and content, I know, without a doubt, that this is what it’s all about. These lazy days.
