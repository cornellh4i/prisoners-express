**“Thankful for the Odd Things” by Derek LaCompte**

****Being in prison since I was 19 and turning 38 on November 12th is an eye-opener. Surely, many of us in the prison find appreciation for all of the little things we overlooked, but most of them people might find off in society because they haven’t experienced what we have, and still do. I am one of those odd thinkers. I grew up in Ocean County, New Jersey, which is, in all sense of the term, a very “naturalistic” area. We have numerous parks, state and county, the Atlantic Ocean, bays, lakes, streams, creeks, and more. Even the Pine Barrens with their endless areas of full forest and animals. I’m very thankful for being privileged enough to grow up in such an area of countless experiences.

However, being in prison basically my entire adult life makes it torture because I have more to miss. But that’s not exactly the sentiment I’d like to relay. I’m talking about the not-so-obvious things that might be harder to see.

For instance...grass! I’ve been in facilities where there is absolutely no grass! Imagine not even being able to smell the grass being cut. And I have severe allergies, but I’ll welcome that smell. Just to take off my shoes and let the blades tickle between my toes would be glorious! Sure, many might not be completely aware of how I feel, but if you have grass or trees in your facility, imagine how sick you’d feel devoid of nature. Be thankful now because my only scenery is concrete, razor wire and steel dog cages. Literally! I'd need to sneeze a lot because of some pollen! Reflect on that.

Now, think of even more basic things than that. Think of all the little human things we take for granted. Some facilities don’t even have door knobs, nor the freedom they show to be able to open a door at your own will. The facilities that do, wouldn’t it be glorious if you could just turn it without someone needing to hit a button first?

Here’s one for you! For all of us who have become accustomed to stainless steel toilets...what would you give to plant your behind on a really comfy toilet seat on a porcelain toilet? I went to Rahway (East Jersey State Prison) and experienced it after 16 years of only steel. I damn near moaned! Then, of course, I smiled like a kid with his first drink of Kool-aid and laughed at how silly I found myself.

Now don’t get me started on bathtubs! Damn! I was never really the type to take baths, but right now, I’d go to Bed, Bath & Beyond and spend no less than $500 on bath salts, bubble baths and all that. I’ll load it all up in the tub and bring some toys to relive my childhood! I’m not ashamed at all! Plus, I won’t have to wear these god-awful shower slippers! Victory!!!

So, I’d like all of you who read this, close your eyes for a moment of personal reflection. Don’t think about all of the obvious things you miss. Think of all the small, little odd things you will be thankful to have again. It’s those things we should appreciate and smile to ourselves about… even if those around us think we’re lunatics for smiling in such a manner.

If you’re smiling now, then I helped both of us out! Remember! Be thankful for the odd things. Take care!
