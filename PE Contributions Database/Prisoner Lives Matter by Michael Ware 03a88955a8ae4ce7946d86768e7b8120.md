**Prisoner Lives Matter by Michael Ware**

Quotes from Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, “she questioned whether CDCR saw incarcerated people as human.”

This was during Senate committee meeting July 7, to review the corona virus outbreak (San Quentin News Vol. 2020 NO.45 Edition 129 Sept/Oct 2020)

This is also from the same San Quentin newspaper, page 7

By Marcus Henderson Editor-in-Chief

He wrote in his editorial “Stark Reality”

The screams of “Man Down!” (the incarcerated emergency call for medical help) rattle around the various San Quentin housing units.

He also goes on to say, “Even in these times of crisis, it feels that we (the incarcerated) always have to prove our humanity, our rehabilitation and our willingness to make amends.”

But I must say that it has mainly been the incarcerated and our advocates, who have humanized life within California and the nation’s prison system.

Mr. Henderson goes on to say that “we the incarcerated had to fight for our rights”

I have personally witnessed the lives of prisoners matter, the many stories throughout my 17 years incarcerated. Some were heartwarming and tragic. A lot were full of hope, compassion and empathy for those on the outside. My thoughts are on those who didn’t make it in prison, and my hopes are that the next person will make it.

Author and Psychiatrist James Gilligan writes that the self cannot survive without love and the self, starved of love, dies.

In my essay “How I survived Corona Virus in prison”, I talk about various issues on how the prison administration place my life in dangerous situations (airplane crashes, gang violence, corona 19) And I have always felt just as the senator felt CDCR don’t give a damn about PLM. The money comes first anyway, I don’t want CDCR to love me, I do want them to acknowledge my accomplishments, sacrifices and my christin love for them, by letting me out early. (: My life matters because I can now contribute to society and be a productive citizen, work using my skills and education CDCR has taught me. The funny thing is, that CDCR says I’m a violent offender. But I never hurt anyone, wanted to hurt anyone, or will hurt anyone. I am innocent of the crime I’m in prison for (wrongful conviction) so there is no violence in that crime when no one got hurt.

There are many stories we inmates tell our mental health staff about our daily lives inside prison, they are the only ones that will listen to our truths. We talk about our changes and dreams of doing good. I have shared personal stuff with my staff that needs to be shared with the prison administration so that they could understand me better and realize I’m not a threat to society. I know this first hand the two don’t communicate due to certain rules, not even in our annual review does the staff ask about our mental status assessment and progress. Well in conclusion, I know my life matters whether I’m a Black man or a prisoner, I matter to my family, friends, and loved ones and to the many students and volunteers, colleges and various organizations
