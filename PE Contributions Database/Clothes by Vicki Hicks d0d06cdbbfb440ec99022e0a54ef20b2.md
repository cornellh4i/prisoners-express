**Clothes by Vicki Hicks**

Beyond the fences and barbed wire we are an individual. We choose what style and brand we want to wear, when we want to wear it, and where we want to wear it.

Prior to being incarcerated we wore a uniform, work or school alike, Monday through Friday. I wore a uniform complete with shield and gun, boots and vest. Weekends and holidays were my time to express myself. Victoria Secret, Holister, American Eagle, Gap; just to name a few. We often place tags on our bodies to show what we like or can afford depending on who you are.

Inside the prison walls we wear tags to identity who we are; complete with name, height, weight, hair and eye color and your DC#. Periwinkle blue in many different shades are worn by every Florida department of corrections inmate. There is one set pattern for both men and women that come in small, medium, large, etc…, some wear dresses. There are long and short sleeve shirts. By the way, the white stripes down the sides of the parts are quite fashionable. On the positive side, I wake up to go to work and decide that today would be a good day to choose the periwinkle shirt with not quite matching parts with the white stripe. Black work boots compliment my outfit. Maybe tomorrow I will choose to wear, I don’t know, the other periwinkle outfit with the white stripe.

Clothes from a young age define our individuality. Prison takes that away from us.
