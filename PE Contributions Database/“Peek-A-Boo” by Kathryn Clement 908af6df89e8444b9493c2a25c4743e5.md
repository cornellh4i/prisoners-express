**“Peek-A-Boo” by Kathryn Clement**

****You can’t see me!

I see you!

You think this is a better look?

What?! Not good enough for you? Behind closed doors {hands}!

Can you see me now?

I once was a man with a smiley face, then the eyes and smile fell off. So I had to put them on my hands to cover my face, how does it look? Now I walk very, very slow, as not to trip and fall over you.
