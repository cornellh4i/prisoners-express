**Sisters by Joseph Alvin Parrish**

Who is Katie…? Katie Less Wafer is my biological mother. May she rest in peace. My mother had eleven kids before I was even conceived in her womb. Unfortunately, she lost nine of her children in a fatal house fire way back in 1961. One of my big brothers that was involved in the fatality ran back into the burning house to attempt a rescue of one of his siblings. He’s got burns all over his body to show for his act of bravery. He did, however, manage to save one of his siblings. Her name was Annette. Both of them have burns all over their bodies. May they both rest in peace. I miss them tremendously.

I was born in Katie’s second generation of children, along with my other sisters. There’s Doris, Jeanetta, Debra and Annette. Annette was the one who was rescued from the burning house. The first generation all perished in the house fire. Unfortunately, I never learned their full names. Out of all of my sisters, all of them are now deceased except Debra Ann and Ruby. May they rest in peace, my loving sisters.
