"Girl on Bench" by Norman Theriot

This picture was a challenge, but after some contemplation, I have come to think of it and in my mind, I see my daughter who died so young. This could be her in the hereafter, looking at us here wondering what her life would have become if it wasn’t cut so short.

There is that nonchalant look of “I’ve got this”, yet at the same time there us that look of subtle confusion. This is life, this is innocence, of which my heart yearns compensation. A life taken so young, a hurt that never goes away, anger demanding retribution. A pain that time cannot ease.

I can remember Monique, before that terrible day in May 2009. She had found a nest of young rabbits, they were inseparable for a reason. She loved animals and I can imagine that she would have grown up to be a veterinarian or zoologist; any career dealing with animals.

She was also daddy's girl and would pitch a fit if she couldn’t go with her daddy. She never wanted to stay with mom, of why I would later find out--too late.

I was blessed to have her in my life, even if it was only for a short time. I have many fond memories.

Here, we, for the most part, suppress our feelings for we don’t want to be seen as weak. But when it comes to family, sometimes we must just put that foolish pride to the wayside. To keep these feelings pent up we will eventually forget how to let them out, how to express ourselves. It will eventually turn into a wave of anger that consumes the soul. Grown men do cry--even in here.

This girl in this picture to me represents a life that could have been. A life cut short. It also portrays the cockiness of innocence, freedom of the heart, and hope that there are those with decent ideals.

Monique today could be doing something, perhaps looking at her fingernails pondering what she is going to be doing later, tomorrow, next week--next year. Just chillin’, living for a moment.

In one event so many years ago, my life was changed from fatherhood to a mourning parent full of grief and guilt. The what-if’s forever implanted into my conscious mind. Monique is free today. I’m not in so many ways.
