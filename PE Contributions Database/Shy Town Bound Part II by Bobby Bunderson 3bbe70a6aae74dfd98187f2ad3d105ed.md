"**Shy Town Bound: Part II" by Bobby Bunderson**

****The story began in Mukilteo, Washington in the summer of 1987. I had left my wife, my daughter, and my “mistress” and had been working for a big-time coke dealer who paid me forty-two grams and five thousand dollars to “get rid” of his wife Becky. I have been a lot of bad things in life that I am still ashamed of, but killer will never be one of them.

I left off the “Road Trip” story in Spokane, WA. I had told Becky of her husband Dave’s plot to dispose of her and agreed to drive her to Coeur d’Alene, Idaho where she could live safely out of Dave’s reach living with her sister. Becky and I spent several nights in a fancy Spokane hotel doing coke and reveling in each other’s bodies. By the third day we put Washington state far behind us and made it to Coeur d’Alene by noontime. Becky’s sister was a trip. An ex-hippie (If you can ever truly be an *Ex-*hippie), she loved mushroom and marijuana but hated any type of drug that you had to process. Her name was Rose and she was also a strict vegan. A term that I hadn’t heard of before. Rose also made her own wine. She lived in a rustic cabin-like structure up in the hills and was apparently a “free spirit” whom disagreed vehemently with matrimony.

Rose and Becky spent a good deal of time whispering to one another, often looking at me and giggling. I felt uncomfortable yet also oddly hopeful that perhaps they were planning on a ménage á trois. That wasn’t however the case. Rose tossed Becky the keys to her scooter and Becky told me she’d be back late and don’t wait up. After three nights with her I was feeling a bit jealous, where was she going I wondered? As you walked out the door she told Rose to behave! And both girls once again began to giggle…

The free-spirited Rose was a freak! An insatiable freak. Rose kept feeding me all sorts of herbs and potions to increase my libido and she thought they must have been working when in fact I believe my “staying” power had more to do with the lines of coke I had been snorting in secret every time I excused myself to the bathroom. I could easily have fallen head-over-heels in love with Rose. Long red hair, freckles, cream-colored skin and as sweet as honey. I couldn’t help but imagining living in her weirdly exotic cabin. But I did know the meaning of “free-spirited” and that kept things in their proper perspective.

I left alone the next afternoon. I had planned on driving all the way across Montana stopping only for gas and nature calls until reaching South Dakota, however my plans were foiled by State Trooper “Taggert” just outside of Billings. Officer Taggert red-lighted me for speeding, I was driving a 505 Peugeot turbo station wagon and it was such a smooth ride I didn’t even realize I was traveling at speeds in excess of seventy-five miles per hour. A part of my amends process is to try and locate officer Taggert, pay the twenty dollar speeding ticket and apologize for not following up on my promise to her to pay the ticket as soon as I reached Illinois.

I drove into Billings and parked near the small Greyhound station and fell asleep in my car. I slept blissfully for twelve straight hours. It may have been for twenty hours had I not been awaken by a tapping on my window. I looked up hesitantly, half expecting to see a cop, however it was no cop, it was two attractive young women in their early twenties. One of them was a buxom blonde, the other a petite brunette.

**(When I saw this picture of the girl with the bangs lying on the bench, she reminded me of the brunette and this was a good way to finish my Road Trip Saga…)**

Anyways, the girls, local strippers were heading to the Big Apple to pursue their dreams. I told them that I was going as far as Chicago and that they were more than welcome to catch a ride. The brunette, whose name was “Trish” (Stage name Trish the Dish) said that they had friends in Madison, Wisconsin and if I could drop them off there, they would be “really appreciative”. What’s a guy to do? I too explained that since I was in the neighborhood I planned on partying in Sturgis for a few days. They both were game and so off to Sturgis we went.

There must have been over five thousand bikers in Sturgis. I had never had that much fun at a mass party before. There was a huge blue garbage container with probably a thousand cases of ice-cold beers floating in it. Debbie, the buxom blonde, won a wet T-shirt contest. We did coke, acid, ‘shrooms’, etc. for three straight days with no sleep. I seen more bare breast that weekend than I had at Mardi Gras.

We drove to a small town near Watertown, SD and decided to spend the night. We found a small rustic local watering hole and went inside for some pool and a few pitchers. We stuck out like a sore thumb. I felt several sets of hostile eyes upon me and even more lustful eyes upon my two passengers. Somehow Trish and Debbie livened the place up and began stripping atop the long, well-worn bar counter.

The crowd of men were going wild, a little too wild. Some of the more intoxicated gents began trying to grab and paw at the girls. At first they took it in stride and then it began to piss them off. Debbie kicked some big burly drunk right in the kisser. He tried grabbing her off the bar and I interjected. I smashed him in the exact spot Debbie had kicked him sending a spray of blood across his shirt. Trish had jumped on the large fella and began biting his ear. As he “yeowed” in pain, trying to shake off the wildcat whom also drew blood, another gent stepped up and smashed a gnarled fist into Debbie’s kidneys. After that all hell broke loose. Long story short, I got the crap kicked out of me. When the opportunity presented itself we ran for the doors. We made a beeline to the outskirts of Ortonville, Wisconsin. We parked in a secluded area and did some wicked lines and then each other. I had fallen in love/lust for the third time on this trek to Chicago.

Trish was just my type. Petite, dark haired, blue-eyed, nice shape with peach sized breast. I think that the attraction was mutual. Debbie sensed this and after our three-way-romp-in-the-hay excused herself and allowed me and Trish to have a more intimate time together.

Early the next day we reached Madison. We stopped at a park and this photo really reminds me of what Trish looked like that morning. We had to sadly say goodbye. I felt that i almost convinced her to go on the Shy-town with me, but she was committed to her longtime friend Debbie. We said our goodbyes, Trish shed a tear that tore at my heartstrings. We had no way of keeping in touch.

Well, I drove on that day to the southside of Chicago and lived near the windy city for about a year. I managed to clean myself up for a while and my wife and daughter actually moved out to Chicago to be with me. It was a long trip.
