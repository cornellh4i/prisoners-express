**"Reading" by Satchel Denis**

Reading… Would I be considered a nerd if I said the following: I love the smell of pages from an old book. I’ve read over maybe 7,000 books before I hit high school.

I just love to read. Understand how my love for reading manifested: I grew up in a household where reading was the only allowed source of entertainment: no going outside, no TV, no playing on the computer. Just reading. Reading was my upbringing, my childhood, and it was inevitable for a love affair to ensue. That love has gifted me in so many ways: a way to escape this world when it became too much or too grim, a vernacular that always belied my age and school grade, a basic knowledge on a variety of subjects which allowed me to jump into any conversation and rarely be lost on what was being talked about (at least up to a point).

I’m now 22 years old with 15 years in prison, and my love for reading has only strengthened. In an environment where negativity pervades the air so thickly it’s suffocating, I’ve found the only sure fire way to not allow that negativity to overpower is by reading. I don’t care what kind of book it is sci-fi, espionage, biography, fiction, non-fiction; I enjoy them all. I don’t believe in the idea of a bad book because to me, there are no bad books -- a weak plot, a lackluster cast, a bad concept, maybe, but never a bad book. I will always find something enjoyable in a book: Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” book was a long and tedious read with an over the top focus on the smallest details, but the concept and philosophy that Ayn Rand conveys in the book is genius and awe-inspiring. Her objectivism philosophy enraptured me, and her characters were beautifully made, but her story was too detailed too often. No matter what, I found Atlas shrugged an enjoyable read (I’m not a book critic, and this is my opinion). A book as a whole cannot be bad.

My favorite genre is fantasy fiction, things that are beyond the norm. To read a fantasy book is to escape a world where there seems to be nothing but deceit, conceit, hate, malice… Escape to worlds where people do selfless things, where the hero is a person who desires to do good and help (“Eragon”), worlds where the world is alive (“Percy Jackson and the Olympians”). One of the greatest gift of reading: I escape when I read.
