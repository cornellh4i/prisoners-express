***Spirit Wolf* by Brian Lowe**

I saw a spirit animal, a black wolf! Not many people see a spirit animal. There is only a few reasons that a person would see one; as a premonition of death, either their own or another’s, or a matter of great importance, a life-changing event, is about to happen to them.

Seeing how I had just passed rites of manhood last spring and am already a proven hunter and warrior, I hoped it was not an omen of my impending death. Yet if it was so, I would not flinch from it and bring dishonor upon my clan. I, Rorak, youngest spear of the BrokenTooth clan do not have much besides my spear and my honor, and my spear would break long before my honor would.

There were no tracks to follow but what do you expect from a creature from another world. There was no need to tracking, however, it stayed just in sight in the distance and led me on to wherever my fate and I was to meet.

Hours melted into days, the days cold and the nights colder. Each day at sunrise the wold was there waiting for me and would guide me throughout the day until it was too dark to see. The fifth sunrise found me lacking in food with only a little water left. The wolf was still guiding me and I was not going to stop now and lose this once in a lifetime opportunity given to me by the spirits. I would not stop now, I would keep going.

The eighth sunrise found me slightly delusional. I suppose it was from the lack of food and water. It was still no reason to not go on. The spirits do things for a reason and I would do my part by trusting their plans for me. I would not give up. I would not fail them. I continued on. Later that evening, the wolf stopped. It allowed me to walk right up to it. So I sat down on the ground in front of it expecting some great revelation to happen. It did, I feel into a deep trance like sleep.

As I was sitting there locked in this trance, a vision unfolded. Five wolves, a cadaverous thin mother wolf and four half-grown cubs, came up to the spirit wolf and smelled him. He rubbed muzzles with the female and then as one, they turned their eyes to me.

Desperate hunger and slavering chops surrounded me. The she-wolf locked on my throat as the younger pack members ripped open my stomach and began to feed on my intestines. I lay there watching the spirit wolf watch me being devoured alive. Just watching the pack gobble down hunks of my flesh that they had ripped from my living body. Before I could think, before I even realized it was not a vision but was actually happening it was almost over. My last sight as the darkness came was the she-wolf’s eyes looking straight into mine as she lapped up the blood leaking from my throat.

Turns out that animals have guardian spirits too. The she-wolf’s mate had been killed during a hunt and her and their litter would have starved to death if he hadn’t come back and led me, the weakest prey he could find, right to them. Before moving on to the next world, he insured that his family would survive in this one. Who would have known?
