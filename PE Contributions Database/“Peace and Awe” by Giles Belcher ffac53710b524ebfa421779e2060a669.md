**“Peace and Awe” by Giles Belcher**

A brownish-muttled gray dock, a few loose, creaking rotten boards to walk upon. Clear, maybe blue-green water all around. Looking down into the water, and across the surface ripples, waves from wind and fish show time to time. Lush greenery from forests and mountains reflect off the waters surface. To contemplate life, the awe inspiring peace, and beauty around me. To Be still and know God created this all around me is phenomenal. Cloudy to sunny at times, maybe a possible storm coming to fruition? Probably, a small one that will skirt around, I don’t know? Just peace surrounds me and beauty for as far as I can see. To be still and experience this and actually remember do so years earlier in life puts a smile on my face! Some day soon, I’ll do so again, Lord willing? Peace and awe are where you are, and look for these timeouts! Don’t miss them if you can!
