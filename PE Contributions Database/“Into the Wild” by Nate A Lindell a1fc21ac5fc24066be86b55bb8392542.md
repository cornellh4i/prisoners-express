**“Into the Wild” by Nate A. Lindell**

I prefer non-human animals to humans (except for some female humans and youngsters).

Humans, I’ve learned, really are “damned dirty apes”, who can have worse attitudes than monkeys I’ve seen in zoos that fling poo and whack their weenies at visitors (I have, unfortunately, seen people in prison do both)!

Sure, there are impressive, noble humans - but there’s also Ariana Grande, Trump, and worse-than-both, delusively sanctified damned dirty apes like Mike Pence.

Let us cleanse our mental palates of such simians!

Wolves are one of my favorite critters. A gray wolf (they’re what’s in the photo) would be my spirit animal: My drawing of one was in the winter 2019 P.E. Newsletter!

Alas, there are no wolves in my tame yard. But looking out the window of my seg. Cell , I see a chipmunk hole. With no TV to watch, I often watch the chipmunk who lives in that hole. S/he is hilarious and disgustingly cute! (who didn’t hate those old chipmunk cartoons “Alvin!”, “Simon!” and “Theodore!”?)

My hand could crush their puny bodies like...just, it’d be gross. They’re that small! Their brains can’t be bigger than the tip of my pinkie, yet they exhibit playful, funny behavior like young kids.

For example, earlier today “chip” (the one with a burrow under my window) was chasing another one around. Then, for no apparent reason, the chased chipmunk flopped, in the grass, laying still as a rug, while Chip zigged and zagged, then stopped and stood up, chest heaving from his/her antics.

It’s like he (only boys do weird shit like that) was asking me what I thought about the show.

My interpretation of Chip’s antics are, I’m sure, nought but proof of my human narcissism: people tend to think we are superior to all animals, not animals ourselves.

It’s amusing when you consider the Jerry Springer Show, and just about every politician you can think of. Look at the nearest prison guard. F-ing animals dude!

But other animals have the same superior attitude, except for many domestic dogs, which have half the brain size of wolves (you gotta be smarter to survive in the wild) and have been bred to be “bitchy!.” Look at birds though; struttin’ around all fancy - a mere robin is very proud of his/her robinness: “Bitch, I’m a robin; I eat worms and I like it! My eggs are azure blue, bitch - you don’t even have shelled eggs. And what’s up with hair, you people monkeys - I got feathers, rockin’ ‘em too! And check out my whistle - the girls love this shit!”

Every animal is arrogant about itself. I’m sure that even tortoises are proud to be tortoises, looking at the rest of us as being lost in the sauce. “I just eat plants and fruit. I don’t even wash, and I smell good. I don’t wipe my ass, just drag it on the ground. Sex, what!? These girls can’t outrak me - they wish they could, when I flop out this big ol’ turtle hammer.”

Yeah, I could tell ya’ some stories about animals I happen to be around.

Anyway, I wish I could catch Chip and force him to be my friend. “I would hug him, squeeze him, and stroke his soft fur.”
