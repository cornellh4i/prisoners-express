**Running by Raymond Smalley**

Growing up with a physical disability is hard, even harder when it is almost invisible. I was born with a rare type of neuro-muscular disorder called Hemi-Cerebral Palsy. Much like standard Cerebral Palsy or CP for short, it causes some birth defects, the most common is a missing or pre-natal atrophy of a muscle; for me, it was my left tricep. Throughout my childhood, I was mocked for my lack of upper body strength, at least until freshman year of high school.

I originally wanted to join the soccer team but missed tryouts, so on a whim, I joined track and field. My mom was ecstatic about my athleticism and although she warned me of how much harder the training was, she too ran track in high school, supported and trained me to push through every mental and physical barrier.

I was picked for the half mile or 800 meter run, which to be fair, is a half mile sprint if you want to win. I wanted to do my absolute best and although I never came in first place, I broke down barriers and even a few egos. I had a teammate, Malcolm, who ran the mile and 2-mile who also pushed me and even paced me to beat my speed of 3:45 to get down to 3:15. One day as i was at a meet and running as hard as I could, a young lady made the comment, “Look at that white boy, he can’t even run,” to which Malcolm told her, “How dare you, that boy has Cerebral Palsy and is running his heart out and God granted you a perfect body, yet he still beats your time.” My mom relayed the events to me and I thanked Malcolm who told me, “Just keep running.”

To this day, I love to run and enjoy the wind as it blows through my hair. I don’t run for anyone but myself. Run your race, break down your barriers, and ignore those who seek your failure
