**by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

****I used to love burning the trash. I’d dump it into an oil drum and light it, watching the flames leap up. When the bottom burned out, we bought an incinerator shaped like a rocket ship without fins or boosters. It was perforated to admit air and fitted with grills inside. It was safer than the oil drum and burned trash faster and more efficiently. The fire got so hot that the metal glowed red and purple.

I didn’t have an allowance back then, and no one had to tell me to do that chore. I checked the waste baskets regularly and eagerly--until I reached the age when a boy becoming a man starts to wonder about his place in the family. “Not today,” I said. “I don’t feel like it.”

That was a hard thing to say because I was bored and wanted to light a good fire, but there are some things a guy’s gotta do. I wasn’t rebelling. There was something I needed to know, even at the risk of an important privilege. However, my mother told me a second time. It wasn’t a welcome announcement that the can was ready for me. Trash disposal remained my responsibility for over a decade until I bought my own house and moved out. Burning was never quite the same.

I never had an outside job during the school year. I paid for college and law school with a scholarship and with savings from summer employment income. I was a tour guide at Plymouth Rock. I stood in the shelter of a stone portico with a vaulted roof with no keystone. Below me was the remnant of a 2.5 ton boulder of Dedham granodiorite. Tourists came from all over the world to see it. To the North, the Mayflower II was tied up at the state pier. Across the street, Coles Hill where half the original band of Separatist and strangers had been buried in their first winter in America, was surmounted by a bronze statue of Massasoit. To the South was the mouth of Town Brook which originated at Billington Sea, named after the first white man hanged for murder in the New World.

The story of the Pilgrims was one about me. The Bartlett castle is in Stopham, England, and my great great great great great great great great grandfather crossed the ocean seeking religious freedom. Sitting in my cell now, I know something went wrong.

When I talked with individual tourists the first summer, I asked where they were from. I listened to their accents, inflections, and speech patterns carefully. In subsequent summers, I told them where they were from since I learned to identify countries, cities, and some neighborhoods. Some have lived their entire lives in one area, many were more challenging. I could name 2-3 places they had lived, although I seldom knew when or why they moved.

Besides local history, I taught myself many subjects. Most of my teaching has been volunteer work, and I chose another related profession for my primary source of income. It’s been many years since I lit a fire, but I still love to teach.
