**“Life’s Purpose”** **by Tommy Hightower**

Every human being must have a purpose in life, trust you to die inside. Life only has meaning, when it has a purpose, goal, plan. It may be family, career, social standing, economical. Clean goals lead to a “purpose driven life,” as a religious leader penned a couple decades ago.

My life's purpose, before, during, and after prison was always social justice activism.To be a good community organizer on issues of need for the whole of the community.

In prison, as a paralegal prior to my 95 conviction, I entered prison a legal expert. For the years 1996 through today, 8/14/97, we took on unjust policies and regulations which allow abusive staff to continue abusing with state sanctioned approval. Case after case, I went after the actual regulation, policy on unwritten custom, as constitutionally impermissible. I won 90% of the time, yet suffered retaliation for it.

“Doing right is ever easy, yet it is always the right thing to do no matter the personal suffering.”

In 2013, I had an outline of a work of creative nonfiction, 20 designed to lead to a new social revolution. I had put it aside, as mainly chapter readings: then on my birthday, Feb. 13, 2014. Staff retaliated against me, by placing a nut job gang drop act in my cell with knowledge of where my spinal discs at L-4-S-1 impinged my spine. Painful yet I could still walk while count started, I was facing away from my torpedo cellmate, learning over, back vulnerable. Suddenly, I was hit, hobbit punches all over L-4 to S-1, and dropped to the floor. 10 seconds later the guard was there, and the guy spread an eagle and laughed. I never have walked since, I’m wheelchair bound.

The inmate laughed because he knew he would be rewarded by staff I had reported to internal affairs for serious physical abuses. He was brought back to my cell block the same night. I knew then I may never live to see my work finished. The staff put the attacker in another elderly litigators cell-that man won 3 million a few years before and had an outside attorney-get here staff was so artistic as to have the man attacked in his sleep less than 2 days after my attack. The young attacker used a boot to beat the old guy bloody in his sleep. Again they moved to another block, no ad-Seg, no SHU, just took away his privileges. In 10 blocks, again he is placed in another older litigators cell. But-the block officer had just got fined, demoted over my lawsuit-He had learned better than to allow it-He, in good conscious, cuffed up the kid on the spot and said “not in my block,” your history-he went straight to the top and had the laughing attacker shipped out to concern SHU. That officer grew as a human because I had stood up to his abuse a couple years before, through federal court action. He was not mad at me, but was humbled over his own shortcomings. His fellow staff hated me over it-which is why the guard went the extra mile to do the right thing.

I came back to my cell that night, and talked to my creator as to what to do. That night I pulled out my trusty Brother Electric typewriter. Pulled out my chapter outlines, and started typing out my “Life’s work,” my “life's purpose.” In 6 weeks I completed my book “Cold Black Heart Syndrome.”

My sista May and I made a business deal. I refuse charity but will take a loan. She paid a $1000 to have it edited, plus $200 for my original art to be digitized for the cover and interior.

In 2016, at long last, we loaded my work onto Amazon ebook and created a space paperback. It’s a must for all of humanity to read. Check it out at ISBN 978-1-4951-2 amazon.com.

It’s 13 chapters, 174 pages you can learn how our elite has been manipulating us all into a divided society. Our view of our differences has been manipulated to see differences as a negative instead of the positive our Creator designed us to feel.

Think Trump! Think for left esoterics. Each as an elite leader who has made their self your personal savior and drained all that power from it for personal gain. Religious leaders, politicians, corporate titans, media personalities, lobbyists all use “Cold Black Heart Syndrome” to manipulate you.

What is “Cold Black Heart Syndrome?” It’s the negative emotions every human being has harbored and allowed to fester into rage. It’s the manipulation of other people’s negative characteristics in order to insert yourself or your gause into others’ lives!

You can protect yourself, and your community from the deluge of Cold Black Heart Syndrome by first learning what it is and how to spot it. This book is an inspirational self-help creative nonfiction designed to lead to a world wide social movement. To join us all as one humanity; who shall retake their communities, nations, and futures from those who seek to capitalize of hate, division, destruction, even war. It’s a trillion dollar industry. Hate, division and all it’s various genotypes fuel the political machines, security industries, defense industries. It gets people elected to higher office. It sells merchandise.

Learn how to detect this syndrome, and defend yourself. Join this social movement in its infancy. Help write the next edition with the author and readers. We can change the world. It all begins with you and the knowledge in these pages. Come join the movement. It’s long overdue, and timely in today’s world!!!
