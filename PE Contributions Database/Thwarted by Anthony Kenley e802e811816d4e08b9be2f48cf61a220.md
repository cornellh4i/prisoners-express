**Thwarted by Anthony Kenley**

I want to tell a true story about how one of the Devil’s schemes was thwarted. I told this story of my experience at my Christian group meeting when we were debating guardian angels.

I had been out country music clubbing in Dallas until about 1:30 AM. I was alone. On the way home I decided to stop at a Jack In The Box and get some munchies for my drive. I pulled off the freeway and got on the service road heading toward the restaurant further ahead.

The freeway was raised about thirty feet above the service road and lit, like any city. I noticed the service road area was unnaturally dark for some unknown reason. It registered in my mind that I couldn’t even see as far as my normal headlight range; imagine the limited visibility of a fog bank, but without any fog. I was traveling in the right lane, going slow because of the limited visibility. I was going along and I heard “Change lanes!” come from my passenger seat. No kidding here! It was like I had a passenger sitting there.

I actually turned to my passenger side and answered “Why? There’s not even any other traffic.” I wasn’t even spooked about talking to myself for some reason either. Who would’ve thought? I kept going in the right lane.

Again a voice comes from my passenger seat and says “Change lanes!” Serious as a heart attack!

My mind tells me, “Dude this is the Devil messing with you. There’s a cop hiding up there and he’s going to get you for an illegal lane change.” Of course, this is at the speed of thought. Now I’ve seen Amityville Horror. When I hear a voice tell me something in such a manner, I listen. Darn tooting!

So I put on my light blinker and change lanes. As I get in the outside lane I barely miss hitting a biker picking themselves up off their wrecked bike lying in the inside lane. I never saw this person at all in my headlights until I was actually beside them and passing. I would have hit them and probably run completely over them as they were centered in the right lane and in the process of getting up.

Who would’ve believed I hadn’t been able to see this person and avoided this accident? We’re in the middle of a lighted city.

I was so freaked out I didn’t even stop to help this person. I had to pull into a gas station to get over the shakes. I even skipped getting something to eat. I still don’t know if that was my guardian angel or theirs. I still do wonder too. I do know this though: that night the Devil’s agenda was thwarted! Amen!
