**"Women In Water" by Matthew Fox**

One of the first books I read in my high school library was a memoir. “Blood on the Risers” by John Leppelman chronicled a voluntary air calvary’s tour in Vietnam. I remember its grit and tragedy told in a harrowing first-person narrative. The author lamented the waste of men and munitions through hierarchical bungling. His best friend was killed by a 500 lb bomb dropped too close to friendly lines. Leppelman had to deal with the horror of his M-16 jamming in a firefight, and saw the results of such jams, walking by the semi-broken-down rifles cradled in the hands of dead soldiers. “Why were they using a weapon that needed routine cleaning in ‘the dirtiest country in the world?’” he wondered.

Besides this, Oliver Stone’s “Platoon” and Stanley Kubrick’s nerve-chilling “Full Metal Jacket” were also movies I have seen. Something about this war really spoke to me and made me pursue it. I read “We Were Soldiers Once...and Young” after seeing the movie.

The more I read and watched the more I mourned for that sad generation. The hippie culture I didn’t understand. The protesters I could sympathize with. But it was the soldiers’ side I took Leppelman was disgusted at Nixon’s decision to end the war. All the authors and directors who actually served in Vietnam were universal in their contempt for the treatment of the soldiers coming home--derided for not being able to “win the war” and then condemned them for their butchery.

In prison I have been able to read more. “A Bright Shining Lie” by Neill Sheehan, “Matterhorn” by Karl Marlantes, Tim O’Brien’s “The Things They Carried”, and “Dispatches” by Michael Herr are all books I got our library to buy.

One thing that stands clear in my memory is the sentencing of Lt. William Callery. Convicted of numerous counts of murder for the My Lai massacre (it was reported that the lieutenant personally machine-gunned fifty-plus unarmed civilians, including women and children, in a ditch), he was only sentenced to a few years of imprisonment. And then he was pardoned by Nixon.

While I have no pretensions to judge the actions of a platoon under the tortuous stresses of war, I can’t help but judge the callousness of the government’s regard for murder. And being in prison for murder, I can judge for myself. While what I’ve done haunts me, I wonder what haunts the government that put me behind bars. My incarceration was justified, but when the state speaks of justice and morality, I am always dubious and skeptical that they don’t even know what those terms mean.
