**“Girl Looking Through Window” by Bobby Cart**

I asked you to save me, O God! This sin has me to pay dirt.

I am deep in the black market by the way of your network.

The words have formed many things to contractors and American idols but still, I see the locks and loads and the rest of the trifle.

Those who hate me without no sense outnumber the hairs on my head, they seek to destroy me by voucher or caretaker even to the bed.

I am the black sheep to my own family and the insults fall like raindrops on my head, they mock, they mimic, they imitate even to every morsel that is fed.

This place was made not just for me cause it’s your building from the ground to the ceiling and even to these jealous feelings.

I noticed there was a figure, MAYA. Go ahead and call it.

You chose the foolish thing to shame the wise and the weak thing to shame the strong and I vomit.

There are faces of landmarks and picnics and parts of service.

My heart is like a trigger onto sympathy, disgrace if my bones disfigure and I am not worth it.

Through all the comfort and pain and every humiliating game, I was like a poor ox just looking for grain.

O God the seas and mountains of ZION they just call your name.

They’re looking for a dwelling place where your face has been framed.

Tell me if you know, have you conquered the darkness of sleep?

Every time of the day and every night of the week.

Are you ready to uncover and do away with me like the stars and the moon?

Is there a defect or fraud of an infant that was brought in your bloom?

Was it my ignorance that made me spiritually unclean?

Or maybe I was just not perfect, the mind was a dream!

There are doings and laws of who is right and who is wrong,

Then the next morning I was awakened by a touch of a fallen feather and I realize life must go on.
