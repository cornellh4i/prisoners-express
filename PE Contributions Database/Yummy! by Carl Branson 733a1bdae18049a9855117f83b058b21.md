**"Yummy!" by Carl Branson**

It matters not what the pundits claim about its importance, breakfast has always been my favorite meal of the day!

My love affair with wakeup grub began early in childhood. Home movies confirm my splashing through bowls of Pablum in a rickety wooden highchair, graduating to oatmeal laced with cinnamon and brown sugar. Later, personal memory weaves a pattern of Elizabethan lace blending daily routines of school years with special occasions including visits home after leaving the nest.

During the work or school week, mom manned the kitchen as a short-order cook for the better part of two hours due to the different departure times for dad, me, and my four siblings. Although old standards of eggs, pancakes, waffles, or French toast with bacon/sausage were commonly rare, mom also liked to experiment with specialties from around the world- always an exciting tasty treat. On weekends, dad frequently tied on the apron to give mom a break. His specialty was scrambled eggs chuck full of pan-seared kielbasa coins, diced onions, and green pepper strips. There was also this annual Easter morning celebration made special by grandmother's homemade horseradish-merely opening the jar would clear everyone’s sinuses from basement to attic-which we would liberally slather over hard-boiled eggs and center cut slabs of ham.

I carried on my parent’s example of hearty, enjoyable morning meals with my own children. My repertoire added items conceived from exposure to other cultures during college. A personal favorite well accepted by my son and daughter is eggs poached in a bed of corned beef hash.

Now, as a I spend those “golden years” of life behind razor wire topped fences, breakfast is but a specter of the advertised items. It all looks tempting on the menu, but the reality that appears on the “plate” is the product of penny-pinching mass production and haste. Seasoning each day’s fare with the tastes from memory make things more palatable. Adding a dash of the knowledge that real meals await in the future makes each morning more tolerable.
