**My Body by Jeremiah S. Taylor**

I don’t consider my body one to behold or put on a billboard. I’ve struggled with body shame my whole teenage young-adult life. I’ve been called names - toothpick, stickboy, told to hold onto something or I’d blow away. Now that I came to prison it seemed as if some of the negativity I lived with followed me but also it finally seemed that I was accepted for who I was. WRONG. It turns out now my body became a source for more bullying and objectification. Men telling me how good I looked, how they’d like to do things to me. Well I had enough, so I’ve used my time to shape and mold my body into what I wanted. A more confident young man. I started cutting my hair and styling it differently, started to work out and even started allowing myself to wear shorts more, strap-tee shirts, got tattoos. Started working on my self-confidence, started to find phrases to tell myself I’m not who I used to be. As I look at my body I’ve also seen it’s served me well as being tall and slim. I am able to move around much easier and bosses asked for my help more. Seeing myself now as I do, I feel my body isn’t too bad but I would still do changes to it if I could. But we only have one body,one life, so I have to make the best of it.
