**Making Love by Yankee Lawyer**

“Making Love” is a curious concept. I don’t like it. This expression is one of Satan’s most clever illusions, right after “there is no devil.”

Love is not something we make, like ice cream, peanut butter, or Tennessee whiskey. It’s more than a feeling. It’s a gift from God. We suppress it or we express it, and share it. For a Christian, it’s a way of life. Someone sang:

Rainy Day People don’t hide love inside,

They just pass it on.

Ike Turner was a talented musician in his own right; but when he teamed up Tina Turner, something magical happened. I’ve heard that he didn’t treat her right, though. Maybe that’s why she sang:

What’s love got to do with it?

What’s love but a second hand emotion?

What’s love got to do with it?

Who needs a heart

When a heart can be broken?

Talk about “making love” confuses our children. Elaborate courtship rituals are almost a thing of the past. A young man thinks if a girl sees his penis, she’ll love him. A young woman thinks if she spreads her legs, a young man will love her. That’s not the way it works.

I try not to talk about making love. There are better terms, like “copulate” or “fuck”, depending upon the occasion and the company.

I never made love to my wife, but within 18 months after our wedding, we had three children (Laura and the twins). That’s because I loved her. If I could have made her love me, I wouldn’t be in prison.
