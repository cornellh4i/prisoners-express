**“A Close Call” by Sarah Julie Spencer**

It was an indecisive Fourth of July. The year was 1978! I was a sophomore in college, and my friends, Matt, Terry, and Bret, were already college graduates from the small cozy private college I was attending in Montecito, CA. I was there on a scholarship I had won from my excellent grades in high school!

Matt was actually my boss in the college bookstore. In spite of the scholarship, I needed some extra spending money. He and I were also dating and had been dating for a full semester, plus the summer I am writing on.

It was summer break, and we met up with Terry and Bret to go hiking. We couldn’t decide whether to watch the 4th of July parade or hike a fairly small mountain path. We chose the latter.

For lunch, we brought cheese, a gallon jug of white wine, and several bags of French bread (the uncut versions). This was my favorite combination of things to munch while on a hike. Actually, just about anywhere, anytime!

Everything was going well. We parked our cars in the designated areas and began our journey upward. I had never hiked there before, yet I was chosen to lead my small crew through unmarked trials of unimagined destinations.

Why I was chosen to decide which path to take at every fork, I have no clue. I was the youngest. As mentioned, the others were college graduates already.

Fork after fork presented themselves, I began to wonder why we had been hiking in circles, for each fork highly resembled the previous one. At about noon, we stopped on the way for a lunch break, sitting on 2 large fallen oaks, wedged between 2 gigantic rocks. It was a lowly natural setting for tea, comfortable for all 4 of us.

The sun crept through the tall thick foliage lighting up our much-needed flunch rendezvous. We had walked for so long and so far, since morning, and we rested while we ate and drank, not worrying about the weather or the time. Finishing, we continued our voyage to the top of the mountain.

None of us seemed to notice how much time had passed by. One moment, we were having a leisurely lunch, and the next, we arrived at a plateau at the top of the mountain, and it was so dark outside that we saw nothing but stars! There were so many of them that one couldn’t help but continue to stare. As we gazed up, a noisy helicopter came into view, getting ready to land on the beautiful plateau we had finally reached. Dust began to fly everywhere as the helicopter landed just a few feet away from where we stood. Just then, Bret, who had gone ahead to scout the area, announced that there was a cliff just ahead. “Oh, lovely,” I thought. Had this helicopter not landed to pick us up, just now, in our states of utter exhaustion, having hiked the entire day, we very well may have ended up at the bottom at the 1000-foot cliff!

Thank God, someone was watching over us! At the sound of the helicopter engine, with the flying dust and the news of the 1000-foot cliff drop just ahead, I promptly fainted. Therefore, I regretfully missed the helicopter ride down the mountain to our cars, the drive home, and I did not wake up until shortly after we arrived home. I woke up on my fiancé’s couch, wondering how I slept through it.
