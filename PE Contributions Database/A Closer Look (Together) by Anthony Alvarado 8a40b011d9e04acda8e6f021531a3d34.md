**A Closer Look (Together) by Anthony Alvarado**

Time to time we miss out by keeping our distance

Scared to get close because we fear the unknown

Keeping persistence with fear alone

We forget to smell the flowers

To lean in closer to make a connection

These certain vibes possess powers like water showing reflection

A closer chance… That’s all we need

A look with our heart not with our eyes

Beauty in the life’s dance that stars

Alone together we could all use advice

The world locked down… I feel your pain

To leave this world a better place would be nice

One thing is for sure I know we all feel the same

I love you… and I don’t know your name

It’s times like these when I pray for better

I hope we all can learn to take a closer look… together!
