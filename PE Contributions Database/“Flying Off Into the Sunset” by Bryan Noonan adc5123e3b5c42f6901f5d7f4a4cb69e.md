**“Flying Off Into the Sunset” by Bryan Noonan**

I hand my ticket to the boarding agent, take the long walk down the gangplank, and enter the plane’s cabin, ducking slightly through the doorway. My seating assignment is towards the back of the plane, and because I’m 6’2” I’m hoping for an emergency exit or aisle seat. No such luck. I’m squeezed instead, into a window seat, and the plane’s too crowded to try and get moved. I’ll have to stick it out.

I put my carry-on in the overhead bin and turn to the woman already sitting in the aisle seat. “Excuse me,” I say apologetically. “I’m in the window seat.”

As the woman politely slides into the aisle, I scoot past her and wedge myself in for the long, uncomfortable flight. My irritation rises as my knees jamb into the already reclined seat in front of me. The person is going to have to put their seat back into an upright position before takeoff, I fume to myself. Why recline already!? Maybe this is their first time flying.

I close my eyes and breathe gently. I know my irritation is partly due to anxiety. Flyin doesn’t bother me as much, but the takeoff and landing make my heart race. All I have to do is calm myself down, close my eyes, and breathe through the takeoff. I’ll be just fine, I tell myself.

“Please store your trays and return your seats to their upright position,” the flight attendant calls over the loudspeaker. She’s just completed her safely lecture and now she’s making her way through the cabin, ensuring everyone complies with her directives. I see people turning off their phones and other electronics as we prepare for takeoff. I just stare out the window at the tarmac, trying not to imagine the worst-case scenarios. It’s safer to fly than to drive, I remind myself.

Everyone has found their seats now, and the plane backs away from the terminal and taxis onto the runway. We wait a few minutes for our turn to takeoff, and then the plane wends its way onto the main runway. The jet engines rev up and the pilot releases the break. The plane accelerates as I am thrust back into my seat. I’ve already closed my eyes, and I’m thinking about my breathing. “Find your happy place,” I tell myself. Just another minute or two and I’ll be fine.

As the plane lifts off the runway and climbs rapidly, I realize that I’m now looking out the window at the landscape below. Everything gets farther and farther away as we climb. The skies are blanketed in thick clouds, so the landscape soon disappears. The windows stream with moisture as we speed through the clouds, and the plane shakes from turbulence in the atmosphere. But within a short time, we break through the clouds, climbing higher. Still looking out the window, I’m struck by the oddity of flying *above* the clouds. It looks like a sea of grayish cotton below us. This trip from Chicago to California is going to be remarkable.

After a while, I thumb through the Skymall catalog I find in the pocket seat in front of me. Who buys this stuff, anyway? It’s outrageously expensive, and mostly useless stuff. I soon get bored and wonder how to pass the time. The lady next to me is sleeping, so conversation is out--so is retrieving my book from the overhead bin where my bag is stored. There is no inflight movie for some reason. I close my eyes and decide to sleep a little.

Sometime later, how long I don’t know, I feel like someone is shining a flashlight in my eyes. Slowly I open my eyes and realize it’s the sun setting to the west. It’s beautiful! The whole sky is orange, and the sea of cotton clouds is burning now in deep oranges and reds. I wish I could take a picture! I’ve seen sunsets over oceans, over lakes, behind mountains and California redwoods. But this sunset is by far the most beautiful I’ve seen. Nothing constricts my view. It’s just the sun and the blanket of clouds. Since we’re traveling west, we follow the sunset, making it also the longest sunset I’ve ever seen.

Still, too soon the sun finds its way back to bed and the sky grows black. The rest of the flight is unmemorable. Eventually, we land at LAX. Again, I grip my armrests and close my eyes as the wheels touch down, but this time I quickly find my happy place. The jet engines roar in reverse as the plane decelerates, but I’m somewhere else. I’m sitting on a bed of fiery red cotton clouds watching the sun set the sky on fire.
