I’ve never really been a person of faith. However, when I hear the expression “a leap of faith,” what comes to mind is some sort of religion experience. Or, at least, that’s the way it used to be.

Now, I think of more profound yet earthly experiences that can be described as such. Those that are less supernatural, more emotional, and at the same time, deeply spiritual. This change in perspective is easily explained: it has been caused simply by a woman’s love.

A few years back, I was in a bad place. To keep it drastically simplistic, I was not the kind of person many wanted to know, and few still wished to hangout with me. My perspective at the time was the cause of my personality flaws. I had recently received a 25 year sentence in the state penitentiary. I felt my reasons for living were few and for love, even fewer.

And through all of that negativity and lack of self worth, she still found me. Somehow, she was able to look through all of the tarnish and grime my soul had acquired and see the tiniest ember of life that still burned. She coaxed it back to the flame that it once was. How she managed to do it, I don’t know. What I do know is that I love her for it. Deeply. I was certain I’d never feel love again, but now my life is full of it, not only for her but for myself and my life as well.

I can only imagine what would have become of me without her. What could have been had she not looked into my soul and decided to take a leap of faith.
