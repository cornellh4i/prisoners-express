**“A Wonderful Wednesday Morning in Prison” by Matthew Tomlinson**

It truly was a most wonderful Wednesday morning to be in prison! Now what could be so wonderful about a Wednesday morning in prison? It was Wednesday, the first of June, and you wake up in prison...rather than dying in prison on the last day of May. Being in the penitentiary has drawbacks. Being dead has more drawbacks, such as enduring the eternal flames of hell. So, really, it was a wonderful Wednesday morning to be in prison.

It was a wonderful Wednesday morning for everybody except the one known as K-Town. He’d spent nineteen years in prison. He had fifty days left before he discharged his twenty-year sentence. He’d miss the July 4th celebration in Killeen, because he’d celebrate Independence Day with us old convicts. One thing was certain---come July 20th, only seven Wednesday's away, K-Town would regain his independence.

“Free at last, free at last,” K-Town used to chant. “Come July 20, I’ll be free at last!” Just last Monday you heard K-Town sing “Fifty-two days and I’ll be through! Goin’ to K-Town and forget about you!” K-Town had one foot out the door.

You never knew why the guard screwed up morning count. You heard their VHF handy-talkies call “Count Time, count Time, all officers call your count into one building.” Two and a half hours later and count still hadn’t cleared. The speakers blared: “All officers assigned to the Chow Hall report to B-turnout. Count is not clear. Count is not clear. Hold all traffic.” Nobody could move until the bureaucracy un-clogged whatever snarl there had been in the morning count. Might not get lunch until three that afternoon. It was ten before noon.

At twelve-twenty, we finally went to Chow Hall. K-Town had screwed up morning count when he dropped dead from a heart attack. The guards called the infirmary, but they couldn’t come because they were too short of staff to send anyone. The guard couldn’t carry K-Town to the infirmary because he couldn’t leave his duty post. There were no other guards available to carry K-Town to the infirmary, because the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is perpetually short of staff. K-Town died on the floor of Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit of TDCJ because there was nobody available to save him. This works both ways. In January 2003, Officer Stan Wiley died in a similar way. Wiley deserved it but K-Town did not. June 1st was K-Town’s birthday.

Bureaucracy screwed up the Wednesday lunch schedule. The guard still had K-Town on the building count sheet, although K-Town wasn’t in the building. Bureaucracy took two and a half hours to finally deduce that K-Town was not in his proper place. One of the building captains ordered a guard to write K-Town up for being ‘out of place.’ Yeah, K-Town would have felt ‘out of place’ en route to Peckerwood Hill, his home...if K-Town could have felt anything.

It was a most wonderful Wednesday morning to be in prison. It wasn’t so wonderful for K-Town. That didn’t matter, for K-Town was no longer on any TDCJ count sheet, so he wasn’t one of us in prison. K-Town would never be a recidivist. He was truly liberated. He was free at last.

Unit gossip revolved around the status of K-Town. How does the administration count that unauthorized departure? Do they count that as parole? Does the administration count the Angel of Death as equivalent to the Parole Board in Austin? If K-Town fails to report to his parole officer, is a Blue Warrant automatically issued? Will Texas extradite K-Town from hell so he can finish those final fifty days of his sentence? K-Town probably prays for extradition. It’s supposed to be ninety-six degrees in Amarillo. That’s cooler than K-Town’s new cell. Hell probably has no televisions, no dayrooms, and no coffee...Hold up! Did you say no coffee? Ain’t that unconstitutional!

It was a most wonderful Wednesday morning to be in prison. You had coffee. You could drink it in the dayroom. You could watch television. Did you say it’s hotter than hell? Ask K-Town about that.
