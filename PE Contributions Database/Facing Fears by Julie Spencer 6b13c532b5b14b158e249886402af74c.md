****My first experience with fear began when I was about 5 years old. It was the worst fear I had ever experienced up to that point, and it was my own silly behavior that caused it. I had climbed to the top (almost) of a very tall, skinny tree with few strong branches. When I reached around the top, the fattest branch that I found was no bigger than my arm--and when I tried to rest against it from my long climb up, it cracked a little bit.

At that point, I made the worst mistake ever, and that was looking down at how far I climbed. It looked as if there was hardly a stick separating me from the great below. As I began to shake and hyperventilate, the tree began to slightly sway in the breeze with the added weight of my 40 pounds.

As our entire lot was surrounded by trees on its left, I patiently waited for someone to come outside and look for me. Luckily, it wasn’t long before my mom began calling for me. Then I promptly screamed from my spot near the top of the tree. Upon seeing me, she called my father who yelled, “Get down from that tree, young lady!”

“I can’t!”

Then he said, “Okay. I’m going to guide you down step by step. First, bring your left foot down to the next branch while holding on to the width of the tree. Ok, now lower your other foot to the branch below that, and lower both your arms a little around the tree.”

My dad kept that up until I was safely out of the tree, and that taught me a great lesson: Never climb higher than you can safely look down without having an anxiety attack. From that day forward, I never again climbed too high up in a tree. I did climb trees, but I made sure I did not climb too high. Facing our fears can help us learn lessons about how not to terrify ourselves in the future.
