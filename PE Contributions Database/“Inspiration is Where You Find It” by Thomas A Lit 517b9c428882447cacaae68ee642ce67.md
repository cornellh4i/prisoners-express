**“Inspiration is Where You Find It” by Thomas A. Littlek**

Historically, prison authorities have acted swiftly, with fierce hostility against writers. Still, prison has produced a rather large, diverse group of gifted, prolific writers. These rare individuals have rejected typical prison pastimes - t.v., weights, gambling- to write. Often in poorly lit cells, with only stubs of pencils or flex pens, they have risked the ire of violent predicating guards to bear witness to things they have seen, heard, and experienced within the shrouded confines of America’s prisons.

Many writers because their conscience compelled them to shine a light on an obscure corner of our nation, the society that funds its existence, and the culture that encourages its proliferation, were punished, often severely. Routinely, writers are harassed and threatened, their cells get ransacked, their meager possessions get confiscated and destroyed, they’re served false disciplinary charges, thrown into segregation for days, weeks, even years without due process of law. Some have been beaten - killed because they dared to speak out against injustice. Still they kept on writing. That is the kind of courage that inspires.

Some of the greats that spring to mind are George Jackson, Jack Henry Abbott, Mumia Abu-Jamal; and it is impossible to mention prison writers without giving props to Mr. Paul Wright, founder and editor of Prison Legals News.

Tonight, whether you’re in Camp Prisoney Land, or some godforsaken supermax, as you sit there on your hard, concrete bunk, uncomfortable as hell and writing your heart out, I am in awe of you. I wish you God-speed in all you do, but above all, I wish you peace.
