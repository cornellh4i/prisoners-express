The autumn moon was shining brightly on the modest house on the Fort Sill Indian Reservation. On this night, the house was the center of attention as a young couple brought their firstborn child home and people were coming by to admire and congratulate the proud parents.

Finally the visits, although welcomed, came to a halt allowing the couple and the last remaining guests to prepare the child for his first night at home. Relating stories of their own first night with their children, the grandmothers helped the young mother bathe and dress the child and finally put the child to bed in a handmade crib built by the father.

After placing almost every evening in rural southwestern Oklahoma, a wolf begins to howl at the full moon. The occurrence is so commonplace in that area that it almost went unnoticed by the inhabitants of the home...almost, except for one person. When the wolf finished howling the youngest occupant of the house answered him in the only way that he knew how: he began to cry. The new mom began to rise to go and see what her child needed, but just as suddenly as the crying began, it stopped.

“I knew that he wouldn’t be able to sleep through the night tonight, but I thought I would have a little more time to relax than that,” joked the mother of the child.

“Oh, get used to it, sweetie. From this day on, you will be listening for even the faintest sound of need from him,” said one of the grandmothers.

While the adults were speaking once again, the wolf, or perhaps a different one, began to howl. As before, the only occupant of the house to notice was the child lying in a handmade crib, and once again, he answered in the only way that he knew. Once again, he cried.

“I guess he just can’t makeup his mind tonight,” joked the father as he started to go see his son, intending to give his wife a break.

Once again, however, before he could even get completely out of the recliner the child ceased his crying.

“Mom is this usual?” asked the new mom.

“I must confess that I have never experienced this,” answered the grandmother.

When the wolf howled again this time, more than the baby heard and listened. When the howling stopped and the baby began to cry again, this time the aged tribal shaman attuned his spirit to that of nature. Once again the mother began to go to her child and was determined to go see what was making the the child cry, even if the crying stopped.

“Don’t go to the child. He is not crying for your attention. This is a spiritual thing,” reported the shaman.

“What do you mean, father?” inquired the child’s father.

“Your son is more blessed and favored than every child is blessed and favored by the spirits. The wolf spirit is introducing your son to his wolf brothers. I have only heard of this but never experienced it in all of my years.”

“What does that mean, father? How is our son blessed and favored by the wolf spirit?”

“Your son is destined for great things. He will do much good for his people and the spirit of the wolf, the most powerful of our people’s spirits, will protect and favor him. The spirit has spoken. From this day forward your son shall be called Howling Wolf.”
