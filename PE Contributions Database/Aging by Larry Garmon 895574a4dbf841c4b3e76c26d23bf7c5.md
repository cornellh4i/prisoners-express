**"Aging" by Larry Garmon**

Hi! Aging is something everyone in prison knows about. Being in the joint, some of us grow old fast, and some never look a day older from the time they came in.

Aging in here, people seem to be more healthier in here. Why? Because we don't have much to do except work out. While some people in the free world are getting fat and lazy, others out there are working themselves to death. We stay physically fit so when we get out we would want to try and catch up with the free world. Now there are some in here who don't have much to look forward to, so they loose themselves in bags of chips and cookies, or drown themselves in salty Raman Noodle Soups.

Another thing about aging; Everyday I look into the mirror and I don't pay much attention on how much older I look. But whenever I get a visit from family members, I see them looking older that makes me notice that I am older.

Pictures will show age. I get pictures approx. 3 times a year. When I see my nieces and nephews grow, or when I talk to them on the phone, I hear about how they are doing in school and what grades they are getting.

Worrying is one of the main components that causes aging in here. I know worrying goes on in both the free world and while being locked up. The only thing that is different is how people handle it. Out there, there are options one can do to relieve the worrying. In here there aren't many avenues to choose for worrying. There is a saying in here "We can't worry about what is going on in the free world, because we can't do anything to help. It's time to take care of ourselves."

Now all aging isn't all bad. A good fine wine always taste good. A good shot of whiskey always goes down smooth.

You all take care,
God Bless
