**“The Compatibility Test” by Keith Pertusio**

“Did you notice…” my girlfriend said out of the blue, “We’ve been hiking on these train tracks for three days and haven’t seen a train?”

I had noticed but hadn’t said a word because this was her territory and I wasn’t sure what was and was not remarkable. Out here in the middle of rural nothingness a city boy like me had no grounds to declare the strangeness of things. She and I had met on the Internet and dated long enough for the word “marriage” to creep into conversation. She wanted some kind of compatibility test and suggested a ten day backpacking trip across the belly of her home state, something she had always wanted to do. I told her I had never hiked in my life. She said it didn’t matter. It is in challenge, she argued, that we reveal our true selves.

Nothing about this trip appealed to me. But I was tired of being alone and marriage seemed like an insurance policy against loneliness. I would survive this stupid trip, I told myself, if that’s what it took.

Now, four days in, my legs were killing me and she, an unfiltered extrovert, discovered my limited conversation skills. So we jointly decided to follow the tracks – me for the ease, her for the quaint towns she could visit along the route.

I did ask her about the strange signs that appeared every few miles. “Constructed in accordance with P.L. 18 - 156,” they read. She said she had no idea what they meant. But with every sign we passed, my curiosity grew.

Over the next couple of days, the frequency of towns increased. She had to stop in every one. Usually, I just waited on the tracks while she visited the little shops in each place. She’d head off to the right or left, disappear for an hour and return, beaming. She loved people. When she finally convinced me to tag along, I had to admire the ease at which she took to people, and they to her. No matter the town, she spoke their language, her body moving loosely as she laughed and threw her arms around them. They loved her like a long lost daughter.

And me, I was treated as the outsider they intuitively sensed I was, with cold stares and stiff bodies. She didn’t notice. Every morning, she woke up eager to explore. I woke up dreading the loneliness I now felt creeping between us.

As we walked, I began to notice things about her beloved towns. At first glance, they seemed ordinary. But waiting on the tracks forced me to notice little things. Like how the houses on one side seemed alive, vibrant with green lawns, with an aura of satisfaction. On the other side of the tracks, the house seemed identical. Yet, they seemed to exhale resignation, their frames starting to slouch, lawns beginning to yield to weeds.

I asked her about it but she said she hadn’t noticed. Yet, whenever we stopped, she always headed toward the slightly better side of town. It happened too often to be an accident.

Later, we passed through a town where trucks were having houses from one side of the tracks to the other. Some of the people watching were crying. I know something terrible was happening. She didn’t stop in this town, her body tight as she walked away, clearly uncomfortable.

A mile later, I asked her, “What was that all about?” She shrugged but I could tell she knew something, It was the first time she had hidden anything from me. Once, I happened to glance at her as we passed one of the curious signs. I was shocked. The look in her eyes as she stared at the sign was not one of indifference, but recognition. Which is which, when she vanished into another town, I snuck off to solve the mystery of those signs. Alone in a dusty library, I read, “In order to facilitate social harmony, each community shall establish by vote who will and will not live on the other side of the tracks. A set of railroad tracks shall be constructed in every community, should none already exist. Relocation of all residents shall be completed by January 1 of next year. Passed by the state legislature - P.L. 18 -156.”

Things made a lot more sense after that.

It helped me notice the small wooden signs concealed along the tracks outside every town, noticeable only to those who knew to expect them. One pointed right, the other left. Everyone would know their place. Taxpayers to the right, Freeloaders to the left. Sick to the right, healthy to the left. Citizens/Illegals, Law Abiding/Criminal Records, Believes/Heathens. On and on. It didn’t take a genius to figure out who ended up on the better side of town.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” I asked later, my question an accusation. She had an expression of guilt but said nothing for a few miles.

“It doesn’t really impact our plans” she eventually replied. “We’re not the type of people to live on the other side of the tracks.”

In that moment, it all came together. Her home state. This trip. Her frequent excursions into every town. The secrecy. I wasn’t the only one being vetted. No, she was searching for the perfect town in which to put down roots. Both our roots. Something inside me recoiled. We stopped talking.

One afternoon, we approached a town, this one backed up against a lush forest. But we struggled to pass through. All over and around the tracks, tables and chairs had been set up where people of all ages and backgrounds smiled and chatted. To the sides, people bustled around long tables, readying serving dishes and slow cookers for a giant potluck. No matter where we turned, our pain was blocked by people clustered in boisterous conversation.

Suddenly, a sharp voice rose above all the others. “Order! We must have order! Lester, please shut up!” The murmur faded as people sat, revealing an older woman standing on a chair. “We only have seven months so we must reach a decision today. So I need some suggestions.”

Discussion quietly rumbled before someone called out, “How about we move all the bald people to the otherside of the tracks?” Tentative chuckles followed.

“Ronald,” another shouted, “that toupee isn’t fooling anyone!” A few laughs.

“How about people who mow their lawns at six in the morning?” yelled a woman. All eyes turned to one man. He was smiling.

“Hey, I like to get an early start.” More laughter.

Now everybody got into it. Innies and outies. Husbands who leave the toilet seat up. Wives who talk during football games. People howled, wiping tears of laughter from their eyes.

Only the woman’s insistent voice calmed the crowd. “Let’s be serious now. Look, I have a list of suggestions from the State.” She consulted a piece of paper as people groaned.

“Over fifty and under?” she started. Protesting voices. “How about with kids and without?” More angry shouts. “Straight and gay? Republicans and Democrats? What?”

Finally, A tall woman stood. “Look, Evelyn. Anyway we do this, we’re breaking apart friendships, some decades old. We’re splitting families. This is all about separation but this town has always been about helping one another, through thick and thin. No matter how we divide us up, we’re destroying all that’s good about us.”

The crowd erupted into applause and Evelyn stepped down in defeat. “So what do you want to do?” she asked.

There was a pause before someone yelled, “Lets eat!” The crowd stood as one and flowed toward the tables of food, making sure the elderly and little children stood first in line.

For the first time since we had arrived, I looked at my girlfriend. Her face was contorted in disgust. Disgust at these crowds. Disgust at all this mixing. Disgust at people’s lack of disgust with each other.

She grabbed my arm. “Come on,” she hissed. “This isn’t our kind of town.”

I stood still, surrounded by people of all hue and background who simply enjoyed being together. She pulled again.

Then I said words we both knew were coming. “You go on, I think I’ll stay for a while.”

She looked at me, her eyes first questioning and then understanding.Then she turned, edged through the people and walked down to the tracks alone where she would find a different kind of town to welcome her.

With sadness, I watched him go until someone thrust a plate into my hand, clapped me on the shoulder and nudged me toward the food.

“Come friend, help yourself.”

In the few days I stayed, a decision was never reached and I often wondered in the decades since, what happened. Other towns built walls or in difficulty watched one side disintegrate. Some towns disappeared altogether as both sides rotted away from the inside.

Which is why I have come back. On the left side, beautiful houses with green lawns and playing children extend to the forest. On the right, a vacant, overgrown field holds crumbling foundations of the houses that had once sat there. But there is no sadness on either side. No, the houses on the right had all been moved across the tracks to join the houses on the left.

“Look at that,” my wife says, pointing to the two signs which inform us what side is ours. The sign pointing to the happy town reads “Unity”. And the sign pointing to the empty field? “Division.” The town had reached a decision after all.

The sun is warm even as it sets. Somewhere in town, a picnic is coming to life. After all, we can hear the laughter and smell the barbeque.

“Let’s go,” she says with a grin. We leave the tracks, hand in hand and head towards the party knowing, without a doubt that we will be welcome.
