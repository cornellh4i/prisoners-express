**“Double Indemnity” by Yankee Lawyer**

Edna woke up bright and early. A brilliant sunbeam was illuminating the kitchen as she passed her husband carrying a breakfast tray to the crippled boy lying helplessly on the living room couch. On the way out the door, she yelled over her shoulder,

“Don’t forget to feed the dog and take your medicine.”

She sang merrily on her way to town. There was a vacant parking space right in front of the insurance agency door! She was home half an hour after she left, ready to celebrate.

Richard was kneeling beside his son, reading to him from a children’s story book.

“Did you feed the dog?”

“Yes,” he replied. “The last of his favorite dog food.”

“Then why are you still here?” Edna set her pocket book on the table, opened it, and happily fingered her new documents.

“I’ve got no place to go, I tried to call.” He started to cry. The last few days had been difficult. He couldn’t find his medicine.

“Pamela and I have some things to do. I don’t care where you go, but if you’re still here when I get back you’ll never see your children again!”

Edna freshened up in the bathroom, called her next door neighbor, waved through their windows, grabbed her pocket book, and strode excitedly to Pamela’s (and my) house.

Richard went outside and unfastened the hose. He took both ends to the car and prepared it for his final trip.

When Edna got home, her car was still in the driveway but it had been moved slightly. The engine was running. Richard was behind the wheel. His lips were blue; his eyes stared vacantly toward the house where a crippled boy lay soiled and crying.

The next ten days were hectic ones for the Widow Gregory–letters, phone calls, the funeral. The insurance company said Richard had committed suicide and denied her claim, but Edna had a thick file she’d prepared weeks ago, with bills from a psychologist medical records, VA documents, prescriptions. The kicker was the medicine bottle half full of pills when it should have been almost empty. It was obvious he’d been ill and not taken enough medicine, even though she’d remind him daily. Taking the advice of her lawyer, she’d paid extra for a double indemnity clause so the company finally paid her twice the face amount from the policy.

My wife rode with her to the bank. They stopped for drinks on the way home. (It wasn’t really on the way. They went out of town where they were sure the folks from church wouldn’t see them).

“How’s Robert?” Edna asked.

Pamela rolled her eyes.

“Nothing changes. He talks to the children about the Bible and fusses at me about the Bills.”

“He’s a tough one,” Edna sighed. “He may not kill himself, but we’ll get rid of him one way or another. Did you get the policy?”

“Just like you told me.” Pamela produced a thick folded document from her pocket book.

“Good!” Edna scanned the paperwork, paid the tab (no tip), and stood up. “Let’s get to work.”

Within four years, Pamela was a wealthy woman and I was in jail.
