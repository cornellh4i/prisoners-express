Cynthia and I have been best friends since the sandbox. As Cynthia takes a drag from her Newport and stares off into the cloudless summer sky, with a half smile, I can’t help but laugh. She has always been a dreamer. Even now, the look on her face is a though she can see her entire future and is confidently pleased about it.

My thoughts are bittersweet because I wonder if we’ll still be best friends or at least stay in touch after society busies us with demands. If everyone is trying to have all their wants, then we’ll eventually get caught up in the wave of greed the masses cause leaving no choice but to conform or become social wallpaper. Cynthia and I have debated about this often.

Before the sun came full force, we washed Cynthia’s mother’s car. We did it just to help out, but her mother said to take all the change in her ashtray and any we find between the seats, which is how we accumulated our Newport money and cream soda that we halved.

I am completely happy, as is Cynthia. I’ll enjoy our carefree youth because I’m sure that fate will forbid our simple joys in the future.
