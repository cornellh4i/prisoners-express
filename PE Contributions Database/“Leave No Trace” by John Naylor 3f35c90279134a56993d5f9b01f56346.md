**“Leave No Trace” by John Naylor**

****Hard to remember how it all started now. Where the reed really began. If it had a beginning or if he was born into it. “Leave no trace”, he thought as each step made a quiet gravel sound. He commonly used this as a trail. With the economy down, the trains seemed to run less. Not a lot of witnesses on freight trains anyway. Euphoria with every breath from the wild wood weed. A subconscious thought, look normal, act natural. The revenuer may never find what he’s looking for, but the woods have those intrusive new game cameras. May be too close to the a grow and get followed to the still site. Paranoia was pushed from his mind with great effort. Instead struggles of the white man remained in his mind. The white man’s plight some had sarcastically called it. The same folks who never worked so hard for a dishonest dollar. He knew he wasn’t a legend. He was part of a heritage that was legendary all the same. A brotherhood that would never leave his veins. Some may say he’s a myth. Others say he’s a phantom. Nobody ever said he had lead in his damn liquor! Test it! He thought to himself, damn television trash. He’s not the best that ever was, not the best that ever would be. He was good though. He’s up and coming. Getting better everyday. A product of heritage going back to the founding fathers of America. Give him a wave. Take your hat off, if only in your heart. Honor the code. He is the elusive, notorious and sought after, America’s moonshiner.
