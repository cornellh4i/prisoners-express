**“Weddings” by Cesar Hernandez**

Weddings to me are such a dread to attend. My wife on the other hand enjoys attending weddings. When Meg’s wedding came up I was not thrilled. Meg is the most all-around horrible person. I could not believe she found someone to marry her. My wife has known Meg since they were in kindergarten. She always defends Meg by saying she knew her before she became a horrible woman. They went through a lot together growing up. Andy is from Kansas City, Missouri, so the wedding would be held there. I was not looking forward to flying into Kansas City.

We fly into MCI airport. MCI is an international airport yet it is small. You walk off the plane and forty feet away you are outside. Out suite was at the Hyatt Regency. An interesting thing is that the Hyatt Regency is connected to a shopping mall.

My wife says we still have to buy Meg’s wedding gift. She checks the mall directory and heads to a store that sells china. I see the one thousand dollar price tag and say, Absolutely Not! I tell my wife I hate Meg and the marriage won’t last five years. I would be proven correct three years later when Andy and Meg got divorced. My wife puts her foot down and we buy the sixty piece set of china.

At the wedding ceremony I fall asleep twice and my wife keeps waking me up. After the ceremony many people take pictures with the couple. Finally it is our turn. I could not help but notice that Andy is wearing a rented tux. Meg has a gown that looks like it cost at the most five hundred dollars. My wife and I are both wearing Armani. I had a HUGE smile on my face from being better dressed than the wedding couple. I even framed that photograph. When Meg got divorced I had to take the picture off our living room wall.

I did not want to go to the reception. I wanted to return the china and fly home. I told my wife she owes me big. The reception was held at the Marriott downtown. It was only about three miles from our hotel. The reception was modest. What made it better was I met a pretty little blonde. She had a room at the Marriott. I snuck away from my wife and we went upstairs to her room. My wife was too busy watching Meg open the wedding gifts.

On our flight home, I tell my wife Meg won’t be married for too long. She asks me how she owes me. I tell her she’ll see. When Meg and Andy got divorced three years later I did not even rub it in my wife’s face. Meg’s outside beauty does not outweigh her inner ugliness.
