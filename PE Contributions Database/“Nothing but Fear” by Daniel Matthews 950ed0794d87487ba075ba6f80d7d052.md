**“Nothing but Fear” by Daniel Matthews**

****Ya know, it’s really crazy. All my fears, all my worldly uncertainties that I had as an adolescent, have gone away ever since I got locked up. All the real, and the imagined, things followed me around every waking moment.

It’s really strange. I got locked up at 18, when Independence first balances on experiences. I was a naturally overly precautious and skeptical pessimist, but now, after just half a decade of incarceration, I know I can stare down a train on the tracks and win. All those fears I think back upon are gone! Or can I just not remember them? Or what they were about? Is that growth? Maturity? Change? Or something else?

Truth is, I can’t emotionally recollect any of my teenage or exaggerated fears, but logically, I can. Have I overcome my fears, or am I just numbed by them to the point of being iron clad? Am I a brave and courageous stone now, standing against the ever-casting waves? Or am I an inanimate rock, positioned against the vast current?

At least I’m not afraid anymore. I’m weather beaten. A testament, a statue of experience, successful survival. I have never collapsed.

I had new, additional fears, paranoias, vigilances, coming to prison. But over the years, they abolished themselves through dissolution and delusion. My delusions are fading memories, much like my prior young life. And when, under half a decade from now, I leave my incarceration, fearless, I’m going to go to a waterfall and jump off of it. I overcame my worst fears, even the ones I would have never prepared for. The lesson? There is nothing to fear but fear itself. I look in the mirror, just eyes judging mine.
