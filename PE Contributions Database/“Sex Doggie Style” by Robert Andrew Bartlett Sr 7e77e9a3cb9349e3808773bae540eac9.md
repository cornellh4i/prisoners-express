**“Sex Doggie Style” by Robert Andrew Bartlett Sr.**

Frank lit a fire in the fireplace (no big deal - he turned on the gas and pressed the ignitor button) while his new bride prepared supper (called room service and ordered two pizzas and a bottle of champagne). The newlyweds ate hastily, both of them anxious to move along to the next event. Fido ignored the dog food in his dish and stared at them anxiously.

At first, they tried to ignore him. That didn’t work. Oh, heck! They were both more horny than hungry anyway. They gave him the remaining pizza, guzzled the rest of the champagne, and settled down for an evening of … the usual wedding night activities.

Holding hands and chatting while staring at the fire and into each other’s eyes … quickly gave way to fumbling with buttons. They were starting to feel the effects of the champagne (they had already been a little tipsy when they left the reception). But the groom finally finally got his hand into the bride’s pants and found the promised treasure.

Fido had finished the pizza. He jumped up onto the bride’s lap, totally oblivious to the clitoris standing there (don’t ever call it a penis), and rolled onto his back. He, too, was anxious to be stroked and petted.

Fido sensed that his humans were upset about something, but he didn’t know why. Perhaps they’d feel better if they rubbed his tummy. He knew he would.

Oh! And don’t forget to scratch behind the ears.

Ooohh, yeah!

An hour or more later, the humans gently laid his sleeping body on the foot of the bed. They shed their clothes in record time and quickly slipped between the sheets. There was no need for extended foreplay. They were both already wet. Frank threw off the covers. Sam rolled over and raised up two of the roundest most beautiful buns Frank had ever seen. He wasted no time as he mounted, spread, aimed..

Fido barked, Frank ignored him. Frank’s arching member found its target, which reflexively tightened. Sam willed it to relax. Frank felt it yield, and increased his pressure. Fido kicked Frank’s face, dropping his leash. Frank’s eyes went to the lock. It was time to take Fido for his morning walk.
