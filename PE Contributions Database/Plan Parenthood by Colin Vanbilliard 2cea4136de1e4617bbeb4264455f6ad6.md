**Plan Parenthood by Colin Vanbilliard**

Sue was a 24 year old girl that worked at an ice-cream shop. She had a best friend, Amy, who was 25 and a pretty girl. She smoked cigarettes and weed and drank. Amy went to clubs, while Sue sat at home watching TV. Sue found a good friend named Dan, who was 23, tall, and came from a middle class family. He got a job at the ice-cream shop and so he and Sue became close, and then one day, he asked Sue out, to which she said yes. The date was to Dan’s house. He made a nice dinner; they talked, played some music, and then, you know, they ended up in bed, and Sue became pregnant. When she took the pregnancy test, her heart stopped. She called amy and told her that she was pregnant. Amy was hung over. She couldn’t believe it. They talked, then Amy said, “Girl, what are you going to do?”	“What do you mean, Amy?”

“Are you going to have it?”

“Yes Amy, I’m going to have it, but I don’t know anything about being a mother.” Sue had only taken care of Drule, her bulldog. Amy said, “I’ve seen a commercial for new mothers. It was called Planned Parenthood.”

“Thanks, I’ll call and check it out,” Sue said as she hung up. She got a hold of Planned Parenthood and set up an appointment for Wednesday morning. She told Dan at work and he was happy, and he was there for her every step of the way. She called Amy to go to the Planned Parenthood appointment. They filled out a lot of paperwork and was told what was safe and what was not. The lady at the desk said, “ You have to wait for your counselor to get in,” so Sue went outside where Amy was smoking a cigarette, looking at the sun. She said, “I can’t wait to be a mother.” They hugged and Amy said, “You will, and you will always be my girl.”
