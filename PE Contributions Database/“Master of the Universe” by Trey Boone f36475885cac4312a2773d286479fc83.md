**“Master of the Universe” by Trey Boone**

The Master of the Universe sits on an old wooden dock, taking in the sight of His mountains of creation. It is perfect, still, and deep. The lake and his mind. In the quiet, He feels the energy of every atom to the biggest galaxies in existence.

As a trout, he swims in the frigid water, parting the currents of decision making life in the wakes.

As an eagle, he sees every creature below, gliding through the molecules that support Him. Every wingbeat is an echo of truth.

As a mountain sheep, He springs from rock to rock on a near vertical, sheer defying the gravity made through Him and for Him. His steps are sure; His decisions unimpeachable.

He sends his consciousness through the lake down into the river. He speeds through hundreds of miles of water to the ocean. Faster than light, He is there from the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific to the shallow flats in the Gulf of Mexico.

He watches the humans go about their lives on earth, seeing their each and every move. The love, the hate, the indifference, and the all-pervasive hope in something more. The secret is His until they leave to join Him once again. He loves them all, yet they create their own suffering.

It is all perfect; all is as it should be. It is all Him. He returns to where He never left.

He takes in the sight of His mountains of creation.
