**“Norwegian Wood” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

I met a young woman at the edge of the woods. She was playing a Debussy tune on a flute. I think it was all the birds stopped singing and listened to its lilting melody.

That was the summer I got sick. The doctors said I had a rare disease often associated with rapid onset dementia. I lost 40 pounds that year and my hair - I had more hair back then - turned white.

She could play anything - blues, rock, folk, classical, country… but I once asked her to play “Abide With Me” and she refused - she got real upset - she said “No. That tune’s too powerful. It would kill you.” I never figured out what in tarnation she was talking about.

I haven’t seen her in two years. What would she do with a wrinkled old man like me anyways? Twenty-five years old but bold, stooped, and with one foot in the grave?

There was a clearing down yonder where we’d spread a blanket and hare picnics. Sometimes I’d bring a bottle of wine. I’d sit and eat crackers and cheese and she’d play, “Norwegian Wood.” Dang if she didn’t look younger and more beautiful every time I saw her!

I passed by there last fall on my way to the nursing home. There was a girl there playing her flute. She hadn’t told me she had a little sister, but the girl was the spitting image of the only woman I ever loved.

The place was like I remembered it, but all the trees were dying. I wanted to ask the girl about her sister, but the ambulance driver said he wasn’t allowed to stop. I rolled down the window and barely heard a few notes wafting on the breeze. I hummed along.

And when I awoke,

I was alone.

This bird had flown.
