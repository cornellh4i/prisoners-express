**“My First Rose” by Christine Zeal**

I remember my very first flowers; they were a dozen roses from my best friend, my soulmate. He was on death row at SCI Graterford in 1990. It was Valentine’s Day and I was at work. All of a sudden a man walks in with a dozen roses. He asks for me. I screamed and thought, *who could have sent me roses?* I never expected roses from “Bear”! I felt my heart exploding with love.

I remember the smell and the way the petals felt – like smooth satin. I recall smelling each petal just to see if any of them smelled different from each other.

I never received any more flowers but my “Bear” came home after 33 years in prison and now he wants me to come home. I want to buy a house in the country where I can plant all kinds of flowers. Most importantly, right next to the house will be two rose bushes, so when we are old and all we can do is sit down on the porch of our house, I will remember my first dozen roses.
