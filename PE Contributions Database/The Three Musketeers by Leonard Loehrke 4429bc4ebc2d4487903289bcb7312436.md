**"The Three Musketeers"** **by Leonard Loehrke**

There we were, “the Three Musketeers,” all for one and one for all. Trying to look cool and hip with a cigarette dangling from our lip, which is easy for Tony on my right, known as (The Cruiser), long before that goof in the movie stripes stole his moniker. He really did keep fast cars and even faster chicks on his arm. Then there’s Dave to my left looking just as comfortable with a cigarette dangling from his lips. He was known as (The Head), for obvious reasons with his Chinese-eyes and long blonde locks, with his surfer dude attitude. The Head was one to keep a cigarette going in his right while a doobie was burning in his left hand. For myself, in the middle, I’m neither doing nor looking so well. Between my coughs and gags, I’m pleading for Kat (short for Kathleen) to snap the damn picture already! Between her giggling hysterics, she finally snaps the picture for posterity.

They call me (fast) Eddy. Only because I was the fleet of feet. I was also known as the geek, the bookworm, nerd, and that little twerp who all the bullies loved to pick and beat up on. Unless of course the Cruiser or the Head were around to have Fast Eddy’s back. If not, then I’d take flight rather than to try and fight then get pummeled by those colossal a-holes when they came calling to torment me. I’d outrun all of them big jerks back then.

So on our last day of middle school before going to join the elite on that daunting hill in the fall, we thought that if there was to be a fourth musketeer, it would’ve been Kat, the cute little brunette from across the street from where Tony, Dave, and I grew up and lived exactly in the order as the picture Kat has taken. We’ve been the best of friends since our diaper days according to our mothers.

Why I did not heed the warning of C. Everett Koop I don’t know? “Who?” you ask. The Surgeon General of my day. An even higher authority than Mom warned, “Eddy those things will be the death of you.” By the time she gave that warning, I was out of both high school and college. Working in the big city at a brokerage with a two packs a day habit and a six figure salary. Time and tragedy helped in getting me to that amount. It all started innocently with the “in crowd” to look cool and mature. For me it was to impress Kat more than any other girl. It had its price.

It was my third year of college when the Cruiser called and said, “Dave’s not here.”

“Ha, Ha, well he’s not here either” I reply.

“No! Eddy, I mean he’s gone.”

“Gone where I ask?” with apprehension.

“He took that ole hippy van of his down south of the border to strike gold, the Acapulco kind. The deal went bad, and the Head is dead. Eddy, you need to get back home fast.”	Tony, Kat, and I stood at Dave’s graveside with somber looks. We placed the old boom box upon the coffin’s lid and cranked out Smugglers Blues, knowing Dave was looking down with a pie-eyed grin. We must have sprinkled a lid of that wildwood flower mixed amongst our cigarette butts and burnt roaches among all the flowers on the mound. As the three of us stood there laughing and crying, we thought of Dave in that Cheech & Chong mobile in a cloud of weed, cigarette, and gunsmoke. R.I.P. Dave the Head!

Three short years later, Kat calls me sobbing that the Cruiser went off deadman’s curve. From the report, Tony had been heading home late that night in his souped up GTO when he went off that dreaded curve into a lone oak tree. The first Trooper at the scene stated a cigarette was still smoldering between Tony’s knees and figured it slipped from his grip to his lap. When the Cruiser bent down to retrieve it, he had breathed his last.

It was the fifth of June as we laid Tony to rest. Kat and I stayed as all the others left, placing the same ole boombox upon Cruiser’s casket letting Steppenwolf belt out Born to the Wild. R.I.P. Tony the Cruiser!

Our family plots are arranged just as our childhood homes. Kat turned to me and said, “You’re the only musketeer left.”

“Naw!” I said, wiping at her tears, “We always wanted to make you the fourth.” Turning to me, she touched my cheek and said, “You were always the sweetest and the brightest of the three.”

It had to be that night our oldest daughter Toni was conceived. We have a trio of our own musketeers now with Elizabeth and Destiny all coming three years apart.

But here I am at the age of 33, the father of three and a grandfather never to be. The Doctor just left after saying, “Eddy, I’m sorry there’s nothing we can do. The cancer has spread much further than first thought. You have three months to prepare.”

“Prepare for what? Well Doc, you’re not as sorry as me.” I suppose I can prepare what to have inscribed onto my tombstone. And what to have Kat play on that old boombox we all shared.

I’ve been thinking along the lines of something like Spirit in the Sky or Stairway to Heaven. But why not try something new age like N’Sync’s *Bye, Bye, Bye*?

Please don’t cry. Soon I’ll be planted between my two best friends. The Three Musketeers to the end!
