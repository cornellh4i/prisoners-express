**One Day We Need to Stop by Luis Roldan**

I have been running from my problems all my life, scared to face the real problems of my life. Life is too short… We have to know how to enjoy it, because if you live life trying to avoid death, then deep inside of us, we’re already dead… Sometimes I sit down and analyze every mistake I’ve done and I ask myself, how can I fix something that has already been done, but I realize, “If God forgives us in his own way,” other people can do the same thing. I can do the same and forgive others that hurt me everyday because the weak will never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.

Today, I woke up thinking about the past and I said to myself, until I learn how to let go of my past, I’ll never be able to focus on my future and I do understand that everybody faces their own problems in their own time and way, but until you face your own demons, you’ll not be able to live life and see the way…

So stop running…
