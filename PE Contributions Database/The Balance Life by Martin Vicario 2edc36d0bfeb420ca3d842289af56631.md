**The Balance Life by Martin Vicario**

Christmas is right around the corner, and I am thinking about my parents. Back then, my father would deck out the outside of the house with a rainbow of colored lights, and my mom would be baking and cooking because she knew that the children, us, now grown up, would be coming home for the Christmas holidays. It always felt good coming back home. And it did not have to be Christmas, anytime was a good time to be home and visit my parents. I used to like watching them. They were the perfect couple. I always wanted to have a marriage like theirs.

There are times late at night that I cannot sleep and I will sit up on the bunk and think about my parents, now gone. People have a hard time believing that I never witnessed my parents have an argument, but it is true. My siblings said the same thing, i.e., they never saw them argue. I am certain they had their heated conversations, but they must have done it in the privacy of their bedroom. I am thankful they thought of us enough to keep their business private. I sure do miss my parents. To me, they always seemed to have it together, so in control and responsible. As I remember my parents, marriage and family was paramount to them. I get it! Because it is also important to me.

On a sweeter note, I recall going camping or just hitting the road for the weekend and visiting National Parks like White Sands, N.M. I remember the laughter as we slid down the sand dunes, just to get up and do it again. I can still see my parents “so into it” that for an instance I could see the child in them. Back at our campsite my parents would fire up the grill and give orders to their children to set up the table… everything would fall into place as usual. I can still feel the love just thinking about it. Those times went by too quick… I sure do miss my parents.

As I jump around my mind from scene to scene, I remember a time during a late summer night that I stopped by my parents’ house. There was a gentle breeze that was working its way into and through the house. The night lights were glowing soft and the atmosphere felt too easy and peaceful. I walked into my parent’s bedroom as they slept. I saw my father hugging my mother, and I just stared at them for a long time. I remember thinking “one day they will no longer be with us.” I wanted to wake them up, hug them, and tell them I loved them. I wanted to look into their eyes and say, “ see me,” and thank them for loving me when I least deserve to be loved. And for giving me life, not once, but twice. First, for bringing me into this world, and second, saving me from my own self destruction. And in the process showing me that I am still worthy, and that I do matter and make a difference in the world, especially in theirs. I do not recall how much time went by, it felt like a dream.
