**Zoo by Paul Pommells**

I smile whenever I think about the LA zoo. I remember its gift shops. And one detail I remember is that I had a coin-operated machine which sold wax animal figures.

I remember buying one of those wax figures. I remember the joy I felt over having it and touching it. I kept it in my hand until (drum roll please) I put it in my pocket. Then unthinkingly, I sat on it. Oh, and when the realization hit me, I was crushed because we were sitting in the zoo parking lot, my school bus was idling and there was no way they’d let me go back in the zoo to buy another wax animal figure.

Someday I am going back to that zoo. And when I do I’ll take lots of pictures. Post some of those pictures on Instagram so you can see there is life after prison, and joy in the simple things.
