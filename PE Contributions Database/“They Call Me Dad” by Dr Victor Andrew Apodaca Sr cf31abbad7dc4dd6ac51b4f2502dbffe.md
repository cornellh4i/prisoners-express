**“They Call Me Dad” by Dr. Victor Andrew Apodaca Sr.**

I look towards the blue of the sky. I don’t look to what waits for me below… One day I will have finished this mad race. I’ll be put to rest one day. Then the books in Heaven will be opened. Not a thing unturned will be hidden from my sight …

Will it be to the light I go or forever in the dark and lost? Will I be the ones that went before, my sweet daughter or father that had left me to my own pain all these days…

Both have fallen into eternal sleep; both above I hope to meet, but for myself believe because my trials have cut me deep...so I’ve forsaken that which I believe. I’ve tried to keep one faith, but they do not stop from keeping me down, I try to forgive and yet I cannot. I've found the cuts are too deep and seared my soul …

That the ones I gave life and raised from birth have turned this heart to stone, and destroyed the one they say they loved but so hurt beyond what anyone could do, on this Earth even wish sometimes I’d died…

When the war ended I survived to come to a worse death than Satan himself could devise. Diabolic is their plan that Satan himself would bow his head to the things that they planned for the one they called DAD!!!
