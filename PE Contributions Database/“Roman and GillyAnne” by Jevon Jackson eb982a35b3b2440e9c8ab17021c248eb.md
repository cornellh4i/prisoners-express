**“Roman and GillyAnne” by Jevon Jackson**

It started well before they were born. The generations of war between their families--the Foxes and the Geese. Since he was a little pup, Roman heard the stories of how Geese trapped his grandfather in a churn and boiled him there alive. And before she had learned to fly, GillyAnne heard countless tales about how the Foxes had terrorized and slaughtered her ancestors for generations. Everyone within a hundred miles of the old man’s farm knew that the Foxes and Geese were sworn enemies, and where ever two of them stood opposed there was bound to be bloodshed.

One day, as Roman made his way from the woods he heard a terrifying shrill of a squawk across the old man’s farm. As he moved closer to the sound he saw the old farmer’s son violently grabbing at a goose and twisting at and wrenching its neck with his oil-stained hands. Without thinking, Roman ran at the old farmer’s son and bit him on the back of the leg. The old farmer’s son yelled, released the goose, and stumbled to the ground. Roman stood here, snarling, as the old farmer’s son stood back up and tried to kick at Roman, missing completely and falling again. The old farmer’s son regained his footing then ran off in the opposite direction, cursing the fox and his kind. The goose, attempting to get airborne, tumbled into a tree. Roman ran over to console her but when she gazed upon his face she cried for her life. Quickly, he assured her that he was there to help her.

“To save me from a brute, only to be demolished by a savage!” she said.

“No, no. Your gorgeous feathers are much too precious to be betrayed by savagery,” Roman replied. He examined her ruffled feathers and her injured leg. “You are not right for flying. I shall find you safe passage back home. For the brute may return in haste with steely resolve.”

Roman found a carriage to push her home before sunset. Her name was GillyAnne. She thanked him for saving her and apologized for assuming the worst of his intentions. They talked the entire way, without any awkward pauses, about their families and their personal thoughts and desires. As they drew near her home, she told him to stop and leave her right there.

“I dare not risk your tail,” she explained. “For my brood is loathe to understand. I shall cry out once you have departed safely and surely, my sisters, they worry and will make their way to retrieve me.”

Roman paused, gazed into the soft onyx of her eyes and asked: “And when will I be blessed to see you again?”

They agreed to meet in three days, in the apple orchard near the old man’s farm. It was well beyond picking season, and it was far enough that no one they knew would see them. The smiling fox bid adieu and was off into the woods.

On the day Roman was set to meet GillyAnne, he carefully groomed his fur and hurried off to the apple orchard. GillyAnne was there, smiling and awaiting beneath the shade of a tree on a warm, sunny day. He wanted to kiss her. She wanted to kiss him. When they embraced she could feel his heart beating quickly against her chest. For the past three days, all she could think about was how his presence made her feel so complete. When they finally kissed she felt like she was flying as high as she’s ever flown before. Without a word, they stood there for a moment, over-blissed, staring into each-other’s eyes.

Just then, a dog barking close by interrupted their elation. Roman turned to see the old farmer’s son aiming a rifle at him. A shot. GillyAnne pushed Roman out of the way. The virgin white feathers of her bosom flooded red from her own blood. She collapses. Another shot. It hits the tree bark to the right of Roman’s head. Roman snarls and runs towards him, as he draws near he jumps at the old farmer’s son. The final shot. It pierces Roman’s chest, throwing him back on the ground. A day later, in the apple orchard, it was a curious owl who spotted the lifeless bodies of a goose and a fox peacefully huddled together.
