**“A Tall Tale?” by Douglas Knakmuhs**

I always ask myself why I keep coming here, but I can never answer that question. To relive those final moments tears exists a hole inside my heart. My wife doesn’t understand my reasoning. I’ve tried to explain it to her, but I just can’t. The pain is too much.

It was a perfect day for fishing, so I decided to take my four year old son out to the dock to try to catch some fish for supper that night. It was only his second time fishing. He was my first mate.

As the day wore on, I had yet to catch a fish. My little baby boy had already caught three and he was very proud of himself. The fish weren’t really worth keeping, but I’ll be damned if I was gonna break his little heart. So, we kept the fish.

As the day passed by and I still hadn’t caught a fish, I knew it just wasn’t my lucky day. So, I decided to cast just one more line. As I was reeling it back in, something very big latched on and it almost pulled the reel out of my hands. The pole immediately bent in two from the weight of this monster. It was all I could do to hold for dear life.

I’ve caught some big fish in my days, but this was enormous. At first, I thought it must be a snapping turtle or something. I just knew at any moment, the line would break.

My son started jumping up and down with joy. His cries became so loud that my wife heard him from the house and came running out to the dock to see what was wrong. She came to a stop when she had seen that nothing serious was wrong.

“Is everything o.k., dear?” she asked, “I heard screaming.”

“Don’t worry,” I replied, “I got a monster on here. Go get the camera ready and fire up the grill. We may have one for the record books.”

It was at that moment that the fish broke the surface of the water as it leapt so high that people in the next county would later tell us that they had seen the fish’s leap. There are no words to describe the size of this mammoth beast. It was easily the size of a Volkswagen. It had fins the size of a hang glider and its mouth could have swallowed me whole. The splash of the water from its leap soaked the three of us.

“Hurry and go get the camera, woman!” I screamed, “We got to document this. Big Bubba here makes ‘Jaws’ look like a sucker fish! Nobody will ever believe us if this sucker gets away.”

“Yes, dear,” my wife replied as she ran up the hill to get the video camera. She wasn’t gone very long at all. By then, I had worked up a sweat, trying to battle this record-breaking fish.

Back and forth, we went and the whole time, my wife videotaped everything. The fish was all fight and no give. It continued to leap out of the water like a bucking bronco at a rodeo. If there was a way, I could have rode the fish that day; I would have.

In the end, the fish finally won our test of wills. My arms became so tired that I couldn’t hold on to the pole any longer. With a light tug, the fish that would have made me famous got away. I immediately started crying.

We replayed the video that night and my wife suggested that I should post it on the Internet, and so I did. If nothing else, at least, I got proof of my claim; right?

Wrong!

As soon as I posted it, people started, saying the video was a hoax. Nobody believed the fish was real. Like what? Did people think that I had one of my drinking pals dress up in a whale suit and jump in and out of the water with my fishing line in his mouth? Come on, people. I ain’t the government here.

Eventually, the experts analyzed the video like they did with those bigfoot videos and in the end, they declared the videos as inconclusive. What does that even mean? When I found it in the dictionary, I got mad! They doubted my video!

Never mind, I had two witnesses, not counting the witness in the next county that had seen it leap out of the water plus the video footage. That’s got to count for something; right?

In the end, it counts for nothing, I guess. So, now I sit here at the dock most days and wonder what could have happened. I also wonder where that fish is today. Probably down there at the bottom of the lake, laughing at me. I gave up fishing after that. I don’t see any point in it anymore. My son and I decided to take up deer hunting. Maybe, we’ll get us a monster buck.
