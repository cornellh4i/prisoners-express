**“Beyond the Present” by Clarence Cummings**

Clearly, history repeats itself. There is nothing new under the sun. Many times I catch my thoughts running like wild stallions through the open prairie, escaping this war that is raging on the homefront. A war that is deep inside, filled with past and present dark images of cruelty, bigotry, misogyny, violence, and rage. Not only is my mind locked in like some deposit box in a vault, but I can hear, smell, taste, touch, and see the silhouette of time’s impression, as if an atomic bomb exploded, only to leave behind the ghastly images buried in the stained dirt and burned into the hollowed landscapes. The mind’s eye is a jewel box filled with all precious stones and rare gems. Every conscious moment anticipates the next move like a chess player closing in on the inevitable checkmate. Taking time to survey the landscape, the moment hits your eyes like a flash of lightning, a sudden and momentary blindness followed by a gracious aha … Thank you for the insightful moment. The abundant and elaborate construction of nerves attached to the eyes allows for an exact and beautiful image, flashing all the colors of a rainbow, revolving a course of action frame by frame. In the drama of like there is a moral to the story.. Everyone possesses within the key to unlock their future. I am who I am, you are who you are by our choices. The eyes are the windows to the soul. My view and your view is not the absolute. What is truth? Is it our life’s experiences or is it filled with our mind’s interpretations of everything? We all have our own vision of what we want and how to achieve it. The plan is to think beyond the present and open up to other achievable possibilities.
