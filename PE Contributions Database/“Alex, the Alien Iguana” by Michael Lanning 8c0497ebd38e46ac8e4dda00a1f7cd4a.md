**“Alex, the Alien Iguana” by Michael Lanning**

****Michael knew people didn’t look over him or past him; they looked through him. So when he decided to put that thought to paper, he was beside himself with the results. Other than Alex, his pet iguana, he was the only one in the house. And though he had watched the pencil in his hand produce the drawing, he became convinced he did not possess the talent required to draw upon paper a stick figure, let alone the startling image that now shown in this self-portrait.

In all his years, he had no slightest experience of the supernatural. Yet as he tore the drawing from the tablet, he could not dismiss the odd feeling that the genius here was being telepathically beamed into his brain.

In front of him, the fresh page in the tablet insisted on his attention. Michael put pencil to

paper and lead flowed as swiftly as liquid, pouring forth the puzzling clear fusion of translucent veils in the face showing through hands.

He gave less thought to what he was drawing, then less, than none at all. Independent of him, his inspired hand swiftly shaped shadows and suggested light.

On the nape of his neck, the fine hairs rose, but he was neither frightened nor apprehensive. A quiet amazement had overtaken him.

As he had kind of suspected, and now knew beyond doubt, he could not claim to be the artist here. He was as much an instrument as was the pencil that he held. The artist was Alex the Iguana, who was an alien using the power of mind control.
