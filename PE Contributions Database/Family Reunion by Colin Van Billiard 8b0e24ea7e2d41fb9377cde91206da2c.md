**"Family Reunion" by Colin Van Billiard**

Every year the whole family, even family down south, come to Rochester for three days. This year the family reunion is going to be held at 33 School. Can’t wait to see my family from “NO.” I got a cousin, a girl named Nia; she is brown skin. Loved making fun of her accent. We were best friends until NY/NO family had a fight. I tried talking to Nia, we talked on the phone. Nia loves the boss sauce on her chicken, and Nia liked Rochester. Colin wanted to go to NO. July 23, everyone started piling in the house and there was Nia. She was 15, I was 16. She was pretty. We walked and talked. She said why don’t you come down to NO? What’s that around your neck? My way of life Santeria beads look. She showed me a white bracelet. Wow, there are a lot of people that practice. NO is beautiful, Colin. You are my cousin, and I look forward to seeing you. The next day, everyone met at 33. The grill’s going, the boss sauce on everything, music playing, playing ball. NY against MIS, NC, AL. First ten, the last team wins. People drinking, smoking weed, listening to all the crazy stories. Nia told me she wants to go to college. I said, “Go for it, girl.” Then some of the East Side Hustlers came through the fence, and I introduced them to family. They grabbed some food and bounced. The day was good. This was the happiest day. At night, Nia and I went to SeaBreez and spent the whole night there, having fun. Colin and Nia got back to the house. The next day, Nia and her family were leaving so Colin and Nia talked, and Nia talked Colin into going to NO. So they jumped in the Navigator and drove to NO where we arrived. It was so nice. I stayed for a month. I didn’t want to go back. It was beautiful. The people showed real love. I told my friends that Rochester is home, but you got to see the world. This all started my big, family reunion.
