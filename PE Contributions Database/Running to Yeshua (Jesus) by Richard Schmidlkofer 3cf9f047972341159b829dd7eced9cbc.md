**Running to Yeshua (Jesus) by Richard Schmidlkofer**

When I was a child, I had a lot of problems with my anger, physical abuse, and abandonment. Even though I had everything (material), but not love or my parents trying to give me love.

When I had problems I ran away from them or acted out most of the time and not faced them. And I ran away from home, but I ran back home because I had nothing. Or that’s what I thought in my life.

When I have problems now, I still run, but I run toward the Truth of God. In Cor 9:24 “Know ye that which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye obtain.” And in Phil. 4:13-14 “Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. (KJV Study Bible). I now run to Yeshua (Jesus). He is my prize, I run daily to HIm for peace of mind. When I run to Him my problems go to Him. I cast all my cares to Him. If you want that FREEDOM you have to run to Jesus. He is your FREEDOM.
