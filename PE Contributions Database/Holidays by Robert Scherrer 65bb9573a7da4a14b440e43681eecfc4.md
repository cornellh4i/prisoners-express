**"Holidays" by Robert Scherrer**

The holidays growing up and into my adult life were very special times. New Year’s was cool for the feeling of new hope for the future. Easter was good for the candy and Easter egg hunts. Even as I was on the run for the crime I am currently incarcerated for, the Easter Bunny found it in his heart to visit my house. Independence Day was a blast, fireworks in the middle of the summer. Then came Halloween with the trick-or-treats and the hope that the Great Pumpkin would visit. Thanksgiving was great for the gluttony of it all. Then came the best holiday of them all, for me anyway. Christmas. Not for the so-called birth of Christ; every educated person knows that Jesus the Nazarene wasn’t born in December, but sometime in the spring. No, it was for the sense of family and friends, the festivities at my grandmother’s house, and the loved shared there.

Growing up, for as long as I can remember, Christmas Eve was spent at my grandmother’s house. The festivities started weeks earlier when the women and girls (aunts, girlfriends, wives) in our family would congregate at my grandmother’s house to make tamales. They would help my grandmother with the preparation of everything. It was an all-day experience. My grandmother knew everyone’s favorites. They made tens of dozens of the various types that everyone loved.

On Christmas Eve, the house would be a buzz with activity. People would come and go in shifts. It always seemed to flow perfectly, with friends and family showing up and leaving just in time that the house never overflowed. Yet, the house was always full on this night. People talking, laughing, and exchanging gifts. Some people hadn’t seen or heard from others since the last year’s festivities, maybe even longer. It was always so warm and loving, the feelings on this night. It instilled in me that this holiday was for friends and family. Even into my adulthood in prison, I would decorate my house and exchange gifts with my celly and close friends. That little gesture and the decorations would take me back to my childhood and fill me with love, peace, and joy.

That is why, out of all the holidays, I would have to say Christmas was my favorite. To me, it hasn’t anything to do with the birth of anyone. It was the feelings of joy that being with loved ones brought. The sharing of those feelings that strengthened those bonds or mended weakened or even broken ones through love, food, and drink shared. Plus, you got some pretty cool stuff from Santa.
