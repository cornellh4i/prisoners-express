**These Old Rags by Catherine Lafleur**

Before prison, my life contained a teensy little problem. I had a room in my house. A very special room that no one but me and my dearest girlfriend could enter. It even had a lock on the door. Not the kind of interior home door that can be lock-picked with a hair pin. No, it was a serious affair. Solid, heavy and attached to a deadbolt which required an actual key to enter. Gentlepersons, I present my closet.

I confess I collect clothes. I did start out reasonably with an extra wide folding door closet. But my clothes collecting habit grew and grew. Shall I relay the gruesome details? One day I was out with friends. My husband heard a loud crash. He raced into our bathroom arming himself with a baseball bat because surely such a noise could only come from a burglar. Only the bedroom confronted him. Nothing seemed out of place. Then another bang issued from the closet which he opened, only to have everything fall out on top of him. All the shelves and the hanging rod had fallen down. In short, I broke the closet.

The first step is admitting I have a problem. Okay! I admit it. You might remember I grew up in a commune. And it was a weird religious one so as a child I grew up having no possessions. An older sister, Ellie, would dress me and my friend Rus every morning. We got to choose what color to wear out of the communal closet of hand-sewn children's clothes and that's as far as the choice went. At my grandparents’ house, where I spent my summers, there were clothes waiting for me. These were regular kid's clothes, much different from the homemade clothes of the commune. I got to wear jeans and culottes, some bathing suits for the Moose Lodge pool, and a few dresses that did not resemble anything Laura Ingalls Wilder would wear.

Once I left the commune and started life in the real world, I became interested in fashionable clothes. That led to shopping for bargains. Enter the Trunk Sale. This is an event you have to get an invitation to attend. Imagine a room full of designer clothes at unbelievable sale prices and me with my own credit cards. It's enough to make a girl buy an item in every available color. Now don't call me Imelda. I admit, I started to become addicted to “the problem”  especially since they also sell shoes at these shindigs. Everyone who knows me admired my sartorial elegance. I was very well-dressed.

Confession number two. I convinced my husband to sell our house and build a new house... Solely because I wanted a large walk-in closet. Although that is not the argument I used to convince him. Starting a family, close to his golf course, putting in a kitchen garden in our new spacious backyard. Those were the winners. But really it was all about the closet. An entire room just for me and my wardrobe. Dream. Come. True.

Fast forward to my current life at Camp Prisoney Land. I have only four wardrobe choices. Blue men's pajamas with long or short sleeves, athletic shorts and a gray t-shirt both appropriately baggy and saggy, two different styles of dresses: dark blue with 5 buttons down the front and a pocket or the dazzling medium blue dress with a neckline that either makes me look like I am auditioning for a role in The Jetsons or as Friar Tuck. The shoes? A vast array of choices: toe thong flip -flops, black Crocs, plain white Nikes, or my favorite black work boots. All footwear to be worn with the required white and gray crew socks.
