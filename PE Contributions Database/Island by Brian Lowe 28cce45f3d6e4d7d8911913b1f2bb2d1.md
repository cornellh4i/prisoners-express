**"Island" by Brian Lowe**

The Isle. It’s not big at all. Most folks can’t even see it. Their blood is too diluted, too thin. The power is lost from it. Only we who have purer blood are able to see it on a regular basis yet, even so, not all the time. But even so anyone can see it on certain days and at certain times, it’s just that most have lost the knowledge. Very few have enough of the old wisdom as well as pure enough blood to even travel there as well. It’s just a silent monument to what used to be and what could have been.

My family may even be the last to know what it is. For it is not just an island covered with ancient ruins but is also a path marker to discern the way to travel into other realms. It is also a monument and tomb-shrine of the First Man who showed us how to open the paths in the Elder Days. It is so old that, without the power embedded in the stone, it would have long ago crumbled to dust.

It is dangerous for the uninitiated to go there. Many who have trod there have never returned and most of those who have returned have done so with their minds fled, forever lost. It is no easy task to assume the burden of you beginning, knowing the heights of how far your people have risen, knowing how far you and your people have fallen.

Wildlife can come and go at will, but a sentient being must be able to piece the veil. What secrets does this security protect? Most knowledge of the paths is lost. All I can say for sure (even though even I could still be misled) is that it is a nexus of paths to other worlds, planes of existence which our people of old used to move back and forth. Maybe someday, a traveler from the other side will come and we will know the truth. yet, I do believe that if they could come or even if there were people on the other side, they would have already been to visit. Perhaps they come in secret and do not tell us! Either way, I continue to wait and watch, a program to concentrate the blood. One day we will be strong enough to pass. Gathering old knowledge is harder but we find many clues from legends, old wives’ tales and superstition. Someday…

I could just be an old man dreaming, it seems that way often enough, but then I look at the progress of my brethren, my children, my friends. We will succeed.

We can cross to the Isle at will now. We are working on translating all the runes and inscriptions carved into the surrounding stones. It is so beautiful! I can feel eternity, as well as oblivion, in this blessed and holy place. Soon, very soon…

We have had two workers pass through the gate! We eagerly await their return. So far, no one else can figure out how they did it. One of them was my own granddaughter! To think that one of my very own line was the first to rediscover how to get through the gate! Marvelous! The blood runs strong in her. At first I thought it would take several lifetimes, maybe even a couple of centuries to get this far. Look how close to our grasp. We will be a great people once more!

It’s been years and they have not found their way back. We still haven’t figured out how they got through as well. Some have grown worried about the project and want to stop working around the tomb and gate. I overrode them. We will not rest until we relearn all its secrets.

We have come to the conclusion that we must negate all the wards inscribed in the stone to open the gate. These wards are all that’s holding the stone together, however. We must find a way to reinforce the stone, while still maintaining its proper alignments. This will take some time to figure out properly. We will do this. We are so close. The end is in sight. We will succeed.

This is the day. The DAY! We are going to open the gate. We will once again travel the paths our ancestors walked! We will bring back our ancient civilization. We will be great again. Our people will be able to work great wonders, master all fields of knowledge, have the power to do many things that we only thought was fairy tales passed down through the generations.

Noooo...It’s too late. What have we done? What have I done? Why did I push so hard to do this? How can I undo the undoable? We opened the gate and a god came through. It is a monster that devours our flesh and soul. How could we be so naive? So ignorant? Who would have thought the portal was sealed to protect us? And we reopened it to our doom.

All we can do is worship it and hope that our prayers will get through to it and change it.

Until then, we serve, we obey, we die. Soon it will be too much for our world to handle. The ground is already dying. No bit of life escapes its maw.

It hears my thoughts. I can’t keep it out of my head. Now it comes for me.

I don’t have much time. Please forgive me for what I have caused. Hopefully you or those who come after you will find a way.

Hail the one God; Jehovah, devourer of worlds.

Goodbye my fri...
