**Finding Inspiration by John Naylor**

I got some GTL music on the tablet at P.C.F. I was about to write to Uncle Bud. Well, his real name is Carl Etehison. He is part of the prison ministry “Rescued Not Arrested” in Houston, Texas. Well, I decided to catch him up on our family life since I hadn’t seen him since last summer. I played Wu-Tang instrumentals as I wrote. That activated something inside. Everything I wrote rhymed. Just playing an unheard, older Wu-Tang album. I’ve looked for inspiration at times and came up empty. I’ve written things I wouldn’t keep in my cell. Little alone in the free world. Whether you look for inspiration or not, it doesn’t mean you won’t find it. Sometimes you happen to come upon it. Or it finds you like it’s looking for you. Inspiration doesn’t require you to credit it. Or Salma Hayek from Kevin Smith’s “Dogma” as she played “Serendipity.” Inspiration has no pride, thank god, if the Holy Spirit gave it to you. Whether you have faith or not, it’s best to make use of inspiration. And the result was a heartfelt response from Uncle Bud, a letter. He’s got over 100 convicts or so on the waiting list to be baptized. The product of the Holy Spirit moving. And a little thing called inspiration.
