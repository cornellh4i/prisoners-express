**“Kids with Chains” by Cesar Hernandez**

Death is a great teacher. Who lives with that level of awareness? It doesn’t matter what age you are; at any time you could take a breath and there may never be another. It happens all the time---babies, teenagers, people in mid-life---not just to the aged. One breath and they’re gone. No one knows when their time will be. That’s not how it works.

Why not be bold enough to regularly reflect on how you would live that last week? If you were to ask this question of people who are truly awakened, they wouldn’t have any problem answering you. Not a thing would change inside of them. They would live exactly the same way as they’re living now. They are living their lives fully and are not making compromises or playing games with themselves.

You have to be willing to look at what it would be like if death was staring you in the face. Then you have to come to peace within yourself, whether it is or not. A man said that every moment of his life felt as though a sword was suspended above his head by a spider web. He lives his life with the awareness that he is that close to death. You are that close to death. Every time you get in the car, every time you walk across the street, and every time you eat something, it could be the last thing you do. Do you realize that what you’re doing at any moment is something that someone was doing when they died? “They died eating dinner...They died in a car accident, two miles from their home.” At some point, this is how it happened to somebody. No matter what you’re doing, you can be sure somebody died that way.

You must not be afraid of death. Instead, let this knowledge help you to live every moment of your life fully, because every moment matters. That’s what happens when somebody knows they only have a week left. What if you were to live every week that way?

You should ask yourself why you aren’t living that way. You are going to die. You just don’t know when. Every single thing will be taken from you. You will leave behind your possessions, your loved ones, and all your hopes and dreams for this life. You’ll be taken right out of where you are. You’ll no longer be able to fill the roles you were so busy playing. Death changes everything in a flash, that’s reality. If everything changes in an instant, perhaps they aren’t so real after all. You should look deeper.

Embracing deep truths means you don’t have to change your life; you just change how you live your life. For example, you’ve walked outside thousands of times; how many times have you really appreciated it? Imagine a person in a hospital bed who has just been told they’ve got a week to live. They ask the doctor, “Can I walk outside? Look at the sky just one more time?” If it was raining outside, they would want to feel the rain just once more. For them, that would be the most precious thing. You don’t want to feel the rain. You cover up.

What is inside of us that is so afraid that it keeps us from simply enjoying life? This part of us is so busy trying to make sure the next thing goes right that we can’t just be here now and live free. All the while, death is watching our footsteps. Don’t you want to live before death comes? You’re probably not going to get a warning. Very few people are told when they’re going to die. Almost everybody just takes a breath and doesn’t know they didn’t take another.
