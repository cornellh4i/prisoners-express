**“Going Nowhere” by Robert Johan Richter**

No trains. No people. No motion. Nothing is going anywhere. Two rails make one track, two more make two tracks. These are the facts. Stare into the distance or study the details: Nothing changes, the picture remains the same. Do you see the facts? No, you see only black and white spots. All of the details are in your mind. Are those rails made of steel? No, they are just paper and ink.

People don’t see things. They see patterns of light and shadow, which the brain then interprets as objects. How far do the rails go? The picture tells you nothing, but you assume that they run for many miles, in both directions. You bring what you already know to everything you see. Without that process, you would never see things, just light and dark.

I see carbon and iron, polymers and oxygen, silicate minerals and water, even nitrogen and argon. I see electrons and protons. I can’t point them out to you, they’re too small, but they’re in there. Imagine lightning striking the rail miles away. In a moment, the electrons under your feet surge you into motion. How far do they move? Far less than a millimeter. The impulse moves incredibly quickly, the particles with glacial slowness.

People see what they already believe. I have trained myself to see what is real, am no longer bound to the rails others have laid. Free yourself, if you can.
