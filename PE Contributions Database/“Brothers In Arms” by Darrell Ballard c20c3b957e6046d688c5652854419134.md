**“Brothers In Arms” by Darrell Ballard**

	****What is the true amount of strength, physical and mental, needed to carry a fallen comrade from the battlefield?

Not only do you have to take into account the fact that there are people trying to kill you from every action, but you also would have to run through all that to get to your fallen brother. Real bullets fly by your head. Little Grimm Reapers. Each could have our name on it.

Then comes the gut-wrenching moment of having to stop, bend down, and pick up your brother. All the while, there are those Grimm Reapers buzzing by your head like an army of angry bees.

Now comes the run to safety. The only fear here is hoping you get him to the medic fast enough.

Your fellow soldier makes it our alive, though he lost an arm in the process. You feel pure joy for your fellow soldier being able to walk home to his family. Then the government tramples all over that feeling by giving you a medal for your bravery. You take it to save face and not make yourself look bad. On the inside, you’re screaming in anger: “Bravery! I signed up to protect my country! I knew full well I had a high possibility of being shot at! All I did was make sure no one was left behind! They are my family! My brothers in arms!
