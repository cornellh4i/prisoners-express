**“Dead to Me” by Inmate Ready**

She has cold eyes that pierce her funeral veil.

Her look the face of subtle enmity, her skin a mournful pale

Someone has died, that much we know

What was white is now black, death betrothed

A painful loss, as any prisoner can tell you

Makes us see our past, a different  us, a frail milieu

Ours is an ongoing funeral, the death of a way of life

She, like us, will re-evaluate her past, regret the needless strife

And maybe, like me, she will say

Dead to me- are the dreams of my youth, the folly of hope, now so uncouth

Dead to me- is the virtue of my fellow man those myriad promises of teachers and clergy, whose ignorance fuels perpetual wars-the globe they span.

Dead to me- is my flag waving pride, the belief that we are better than them, an eternal lie. Elvis Presley sings his song on T.V. in military dress as bombs rain down in Vietnam, a man-made mess.

Alive in Me- are the undeniable truths … of greed and death

of love and life

The Serpent whispers, the Woman wonders and Mankind falls

The woman sees past her veil, the prisoner ses beyond his walls

And in Tarantula hearts grows *Lucifer’s* pride where the ends justify the means, but from GOD they cannot hide.
