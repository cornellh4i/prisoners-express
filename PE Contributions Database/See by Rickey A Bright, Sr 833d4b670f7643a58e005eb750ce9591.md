**See by Rickey A. Bright, Sr.**

The quietest place on Earth, I’ve learned, is the ICU waiting room at 3:00 a.m. Even my usually rowdy teenage sons have succumbed to the quietude. I must admit that I’m a little disappointed to see the mess they’ve left on the heater behind them, but their faithfulness to the vigil they keep for their mother allows me to overlook their messiness and disheveled appearance.

I am surprised to see that my oldest son, Jacob, has taken his younger brothers - Nathan and Ian - under his wings in their hour of distress. I believe there is hope for those three boys yet.

Jacob, even the alpha male, has been here since 10:00 a.m, yesterday after receiving the call that I had suffered a severe aneurysm; Nathan drove all night to get here from Michigan where he is a freshman at HIllsdale College, and Ian - mommy’s boy - walked off his job down at the factory to join the vigil. I suppose their father will be here as soon as his plane arrives from Hong Kong. I hope he will be as proud of our boys as I am.

I’d love to comb my sons’ hair and straighten their clothes so that they look presentable for their father. They would fuss and blus and say, “Aw, Mom,” because they’ve been such independent little gentlemen since they were about twelve. Then again, maybe they wouldn’t complain at all. Sometimes tragedy has a way of enabling one to see life through a different lens.

As I stand here and gaze upon these three precious offspring, it pains me to know the heartache and grief that will shortly reduce my angels to lost and blubbering little boys. Soon, the neurologist will arrive and give them the bad news: the words they have fervently prayed not to hear: “Your mother is brain dead.”

The moment that brain death occurred, I acquired the ability to leave the body that remains in a persistent vegetative state for now. When the neurologist brings word to my sons, they will be unable to pull the plug, and will defer the decision to their father, who will pass the buck to my parents because he won’t want our sons hating him for the rest of his life for the decision that will ultimately put their mother’s body in the ground. It’s strange how I know these things.

I wonder what my three sons would think if they knew my essence stood before them at this very moment, observing them in their deepest sadness and utter exhaustion. I’m glad they can’t see me though. I’m not quite sure what it might do to their tender psyches.

When all is said and done, I rest assured that I have not raised three kids, but rather raised three well-adjusted adults. In time, they will be alright. They will prevail and prosper. When I get home to my heavenly father, I hope to hear, “Well done, my good and faithful servant.”

Well, the neurologist is at the door. I believe I will return to my body for now because I cannot bear to see these precious sons of mine devastated by grief. I wish the doctor would’ve waited for their father to arrive, but that’s life. I wish God would have waited to call me home so that I could’ve known all my lovely grandchildren, but that’s death. It isn’t fair; it just is.

Uh-oh, gotta run. My heart just stopped on its own and it’s getting dark, too dark to… “I love you boys. I will always love you.”
