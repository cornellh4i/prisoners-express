**“Illusions” by Michael Willis**

Hear no evil, see no evil, I speak not evil. The eyes have it! I’m not evil… I have hands that make my eyes do handstands and a pair of lips that can’t reprimand. It matters not whether I sit or stand, this strain on my brain has driven me insane! I need a bed with restraints and a jacket with straps, along with Thorazine and Lithium to make my memory lapse. This picture was taken without my permission (I wish they’d leave me alone, so much for wishing) These doctors have no name for my present condition, and my face must be an apparition.
