I do a lot of thinking about the old days in here. I grew up in eastern North Carolina, near Jacksonville. We did a lot of hunting, fishing, camping, and working. I went to the ocean a lot when I was younger.

I am looking forward to the new days of freedom that are yet to come. Ready for those days to be the old days.
