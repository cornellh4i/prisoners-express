The wolf sat in silence writing for something I couldn’t be sure. I had been watching to wolf clearly for centuries now. The wolf itself was black with a white snow like color that covered it’s chest and stomach. The power and beauty the wolf radiated was undeniable. I could not look away from such beauty ever.

The wolf never noticed me, even with its keen eyesight. I never saw a mate for it nor did any other creature occupy the wolf’s attention for long. Not even the prey it hunted. I craved such things for myself, I wanted to run and be free of my own confinements. I want no bondage especially not the kind that held me in places like iron camps I would never truly know. At least not in a physical sense.

I was almost envious to the freedoms the wolf had I would never be allowed to indulge in. However, being able to feast upon the world in its entirety keeps my own envy at bay. For me such a feast was enough.

The ground was snow covered making the wolf’s dark color striking in the distance. It was standing far from me. However my own keen eyesight was enough to clearly make out its form perfectly. The stars were diamonds against a blackened sea. The moon’s fullness gave her the appearance of a woman glowing from pregnancy. I loved such beauty.

For I had none to speak of. I would never know such beauty. I would never know the exhilaration of such freedoms. I was never noticed by any creature unless I was the last thing their torment eyes looking upon. I was and would always be a slave to my hunger.

I wish I could have been a wolf. Even they are not monsters. Simply hunters who do what they must in order to survive. I, however, am a monster in the truest sense. A vampire and nothing more. I am a monster and nothing more.

Breathe in

Breathe out

I smell

I know

What only fear can show

I don’t race

Because I don’t have to

I don’t run

Because I don’t need to

I love the hunt

It’s my own version

Of fun

With such rewards

Soaked in blood

I’m not weak

By any means

I only kill

So I can eat

I smell

I know

How to live

But if I could

I’d never be

What I am here and now

I am a wolf

Hear me howl
