**“The Pack” by Douglas Knakmuhs**

We all know that there are certain absolute truths within our world. If you punch me in the face, it’s gonna hurt. Without air breath, you’re gonna die. If you step in dog poop, you’re not gonna like it.

One thing that I believe to be true is that humans are always gonna be animals. As such, we are always gonna have that “pack mentality” that we all know so well. I believe that same mentality causes so much pain in our world. Racism, feudal wars, economic repression, gender bias, and the whole “Donald Trump Era” proves that humans have always lived within a “pack mentality.”

We all know this to be true from coming into the prison system and dealing with all the gangs and the cliques that proliferate inside these walls. In here, you get an unfiltered look inside the true souls of humanity. When stripped of all civilized amenities, we revert back into our animalistic ways. It becomes a dog eat dog world as we try to survive as best as we can.

Our human instincts override our capacity to love. The crazy thing is; we never stop long enough to realize that it’s OK to be animals as long as we retain that human side to balance out our negative instincts. We all have those thoughts of envy, lust, anger, resentment, etc… That’s normal. We all know that even the most gangster individual in the world loves his or her momma.

In order to overcome the “pack mentality,” I believe we need to gain more love and compassion for the world around us. Empathy needs to become a mainstay within our lives. We need to learn to be more conscious of our “pack mentality” so that we can rein in those negative aspects that lie just under the surface.

I’m an alpha male and I’ve been locked up my whole life. For the first ten years of my bit, I was always the “leader of the pack” in every situation. As I turned thirty, I began to see those around me for who they really were. The alpha male is only the leader of the pack for as long as he can hold that title. We’ve all seen those shows about lions where the older lion gets pushed out by a younger lion and even though that may not have been the case in my situation, I relate to that proud old lion as he would leave his land and make his way to die all by himself.

For me, I reached that point where I broke free of the hate and all the other ugliness within myself. I was introduced to the wonderful world of Buddhism and the principles it taught. My mind opened up to the world and I have seen how insignificant we all are in the grand scheme of things. The universe is infinite and we are all but a speck of dust. We are here one minute, then we depart this world to start another life anew.

I always keep those thoughts in mind when I’m confronted with other people’s “pack mentality.” The ignorance of it all confounds me. The suffering of life is inevitable. We all walk different paths in life and as I look back upon my own past, I see that everything led up to who I am today. We all evolve into who we were meant to be, for better or for worse. While some people will always live with that “pack mentality,” others will learn to live in the world around them, free of the things that hold them back. Free of the walls that surround them. It is then that we learn to love ourselves, and in turn, learn to love those outside of the “pack.” To me, that is what it truly means to be human. To overcome our animal tendencies and learn to love everything in life. As I sit here and write this, I am no longer an animal within the pack. Today I am a butterfly that lives a beautiful existence. Someone free of the boundaries of the pack.

Come fly with me...
