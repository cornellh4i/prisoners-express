**A Close Call by Jeremy Brown**

Well, I’ve had a lot of close calls with The Grim Reaper, The Angel of Death if you will. At 5 years old I jumped off a stairwell into an above ground pool, slipped, fell off backwards and knocked myself out on the concrete. At 10 I was doing tricks on my Etnies skateboard when a drunk driver swerved and almost hit me, before he did something, pushed me into a ditch and saved me from becoming squash. At 12 I found some beer and got drunk spun around in circles and knocked myself out on a coffee table corner and did it again a few months later. I lost a gallon of blood together both times and ended up with multiple stitches on my right eyebrow. When I was 14 I passed out with a Tetanus shot and almost went into a coma shortly thereafter, after hitting my head on a counter. When I was born, I had a hard time coming out of the womb I was 11 pounds 2 ounces. They c sectioned me out and said I had my left fist in front of my face saying I looked ready to fight the world! Skip a lot of years and at 24 I was almost sentenced to Death Row for a murder. Due to lack of evidence, no eye witness, and a great legal team I was able to mitigate and lessen my sentence. I can say with surety I’ve had my share of close calls and some Force is protecting me for the time being. I’m sure mere close calls are on the way but with my fist in front of me I’m ready to face these challenges Fearlessly As we all should. I mean, life would be a boring commercial of perfection without these close calls, I like it rough and tough and sometimes you get it underneath your nails dirt and mud. I’m okay with that. As long as I have soap and a hot shower to get all the shit off, I’m straight.
