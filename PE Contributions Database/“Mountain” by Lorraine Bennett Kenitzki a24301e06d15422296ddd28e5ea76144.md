**“Mountain” by Lorraine Bennett Kenitzki**

The scene was like that from a  picture postcard you would find in a hotel lobby, or in the counter of the checkout aisle next to the cash register (back when you paid cash) at the gas station.

The mountain so high, the trees so tall and gently waving back and forth in a mild summer breeze.

This scene is not some place I ever expected to view in person.

Maybe once or twice overhead as I flew over the trees and mountains on my way to, or from, somewhere else in my lazy chair aboard yet another Boeing jet.

I could not be here, not with my faded jeans and holy t-shirt under my sweaty pendleton. No, not here. Where all of that covered the skin that wrapped my bones and muscles, that protect that dark, black, evil called my heart.

The virgin snow.

The crisp air.

The blue sky.

The terrible lie,

hidden inside of me could not be buried here, could not be allowed to thrive here in such majesty.

I do not fit.

Tho’ the birds sing.

I cannot, cannot even hum in comparison to this nature scenery.

Thank you God for including me. I know that Jesus’ blood has washed me clean. I’m the one you created this scene for. Maybe, after all I do belong, for a little while, perhaps.
