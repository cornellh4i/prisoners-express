"Girl On Bench" by Jeremy Brown

Today and yesterday are mostly the same. Wars on the news, people bickering and fighting over the same issues they always fought over. Watching time fly and people come and people go within your life. Relaxing, letting the energy swirl on by. Neither left nor to the right. Neither up nor down. Always turning my frown upside down. Me and my homeboys well we love to clown. Learning and gaining knowledge we are on another level, letting others’ angers fly away in dissipation. This is my indifference to it all. In the end is a new beginning, I am a capricorn, therefore I’m surefooted, I lead over the wall. The symbiotic relationship to the machine matrix, it’s the illusion (Maya) for it really doesn’t matter at all. Going through my many issues, physical, mental, spiritual, my ma always told me I stood tall.

Then it shits unto another dimension another rift. Thy veil has been lifted for now I see it all. Coming full circle, the circle of life. I see it all being done again. There is no such thing as original sin. Ideas created by the established-ment to manipulate the masses. Oh ye of tunnel vision. Don’t you see the reality. Mass hypnosis, it’s all a new ordo hypnotica prognosis. Why all of a sudden so serious? Being incarnated makes me fucking delirious. An anarchist’s view on life. Don’t shit twisted it’s more peaceful than strife.

Being indifferent means we need to have some cooperation, toleration, for we all lead a different life. Each individual is their own universe of perception, living within the subjective mind separating from the collective.Yet we must not become indifferent to the entities before us, for the Saints, Buddhas, Yogis, Satgurus, and Prophets. They have transcended to the status of an interplanetary spirit. We must note this and tote it like a bag. Why does the world have an issue with gays and fags. Let people be who they be, and see what they see. We must not be indifferent to those who are special or unique in mind, body, spirit or physique.

To awaken ourselves is to live in every moment, being mindful of our situations and meditations. We will see and feel the vibrational fluctuations. The waves of bioluminescent energy auras carry us away, past, present, future, now everyday. Liberty and freedom is within the soul. Don’t you see the abyss is not an empty hole. Divine, seek, grind and you shall find the collective universal conscious mind.
