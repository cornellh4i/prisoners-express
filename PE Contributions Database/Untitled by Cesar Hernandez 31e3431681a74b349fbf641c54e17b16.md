**Untitled by Cesar Hernandez**

One woman came to see me and was very upset about us buying the pond. She said, “You know I get so much peace; I don’t come here to fish, I come here for the peacefulness of being her.” She spent every Sunday out catching fish just to be at peace. I thought she looked quite healthy, she was a little plump, she was not starving to death.

She did not really need to fish for survival. “ You have enough money, I hope, to buy fish - you could come here after we buy this pond, and you could just meditate here. You don’t have to fish,” I said.

She didn’t want to meditate! Then she went on about rabbits eating their cabbages, so she had to put out all kinds of things that would kill rabbits to keep them from eating her cabbages. This woman never reflects on anything! She is begrudging those rabbits her cabbages, but she can very well go out and buy cabbages. Rabbits can’t! Rabbits have to do the best they can by eating someone else’s cabbages.

She never really opened her mind to the way things are, to what is truly kind and benevolent. I would not say she was a cruel or heartless person, just an ignorant middle class woman who never reflected on nature. She thinks that cabbages are there for her and not for rabbits, and fish are there so that she can have a peaceful Sunday afternoon torturing them.

The ability to reflect and observe is the liberation from the blind following of habit and convention. It is a way to liberate this being from the delusion of the sensory condition through wise reflection on the way things are. We begin to observe ourselves, desire for something, or the aversion, the dillness or the stupidity of the mind. We are not picking and choosing or trying to create pleasant conditions in order to understand them as just that, and be able to let them go. We are starting to free ourselves from running away from things we don’t like. We also begin to be much more careful about how we do live. Once you see what it is all about, you really want to be very careful about what you do and say. You can have no intention to live life at the expense of any other creature. One does not feel that one’s life is so much more important than anyone else’s. One begins to feel the freedom and the lightness in that harmony with nature rather than the heaviness of exploitation of nature for personal gain.
