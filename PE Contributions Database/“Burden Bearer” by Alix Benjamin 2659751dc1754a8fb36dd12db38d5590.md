**“Burden Bearer” by Alix Benjamin**

****Burden Bearer, you portray an image like no other, your loving compassion is unconditional. You carry the weight of heavy burdens of others upon yourself as Christ did for us on the cross.

Burden Bearer, your commiseration and grace has opened your heart to reach out to the hungry and the needy. You set aside your needs and desires to draw your focus on those who you don’t know. You put your life on hold, lay aside your dreams and goals in life to devote every aspect of your life to helping those you love reach their dreams and goals in life.

You sacrifice time and energy both at work and at home yet you never cease to amaze me with your willingness to take on more challenging tasks. Burden Bearer, at times even you get overwhelmed, feel powerless; your strength has failed you and you often find yourself at your wit’s end physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

Burden Bearer, you are only human, and as Christ suffered so should you. For Christ said, “In this world you have trouble, you will have trials and tribulation but the Lord promises to you, to holdeth firm, and endure for just a little while longer, all shall come to pass. To know this is to also be aware that God has a first-class ticket reservation for you in heaven, known as “eternity”.

Burden Bearer, you have been blessed with an honorable gift and a curse. You have been blessed with the gift of childbirth, which is the gift of life. In the midst of childbirth you were cursed by the excruciating, agonizing pain that follows the miraculous, wonderful joy of giving birth to a child.

Burden Bearer you’ve endured this pain, to embrace your bundle of joy and the blessings that cometh after, such as raising him in a way that is pleasing in the Lord’s sight. You feed and clothe your child, you watch over them like how a bird watches over its youngling.

Burden Bearer, you’ve gone through the days carrying on tasks and making provisions to secure the well-being of your children and your household. As the days wind down and come to an end, the calmness of the evening sky transcends into a peaceful night and you rest the children in their bed. You pray with them and sent them into the peaceful arms of the one that created the day and the night, the heavenly father God.

As for you Burden Bearer, time has allowed you this moment to thank the Lord for this day that He has, but in the midst of your prayer, the calm of the night has smoothed out the roughness of the day, while you lay your head down, you drifted into the calm of the night. As the sun rises so do you. Another day begins. Burden Bearer, you take on the challenges of life head-on, day by day, you face adversities and demanding pressures of life on a day to day basis, yet with the strength from up above you rise up with a brand new way to start off each day.
