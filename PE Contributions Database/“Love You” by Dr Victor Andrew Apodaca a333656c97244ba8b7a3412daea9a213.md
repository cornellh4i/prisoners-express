**“Love You” by Dr. Victor Andrew Apodaca**

What is love?

I knew it once upon a time

It’s so far away now I’m lost in forever

What will become of someone like me?

My peace will come one day

Is there a forever for me someday

Or is it a dream, a grain of sand on a beach

Lost in forever

What to believe love, someone says to me

And the next is, go away I can’t stand you

What is this word that they use to quiet you

And then they lie and hurt you; go away, they say

To you, I don’t love you, they use it in so many ways

What I should I believe is, I love you, wherein the end

It destroys you!!!

And what was said is really a lie

No such thing as I love you

It’s only a myth to help do their work

And take and take all that worth!!!
