**Nature Reclaims All by Raymond Swanson**

My childhood home sat on a heavily wooded, if small, three-and-a-half acres. We lived on a nameless gravel road about two miles past Mr. Hultberg’s Tack Shop. My cousin, Jerry and I used to run down to the Hultberg farm when the big draft horses would come in. His wife would bring us biscuits while we looked on and, somehow, she always seemed to have fresh cider.

When I was ten years old we had a change in living when my parents separated. It was determined that mom would get us full time. I wouldn’t see my father again until High School Graduation. I did not recognize him even as he stood before me. He looked so much older than I ever could have imagined. I went off to college in upstate New York but thought of my father everyday, and what he’d been through that made him so old. Finally, on a cold, late-October, Tuesday my friend, Herman, suggested we just drive the three hours to visit dad. Hesitantly, if anxiously, I sat in that old Plymouth as he drove on Route 17W. Once we got close I told him to pull over and we switched seats.

As we approached the intersection of my old road I pulled over in a false hope of seeing old Mr. Hultberg. His former shop stood alone in an overgrown field embedded in a mass of ever-encroaching bushes and trees. There was no trace that a house ever accompanied the barn.

I hurried Herman back to the car and accelerated down the gravel road until we came upon the same old mailbox I once helped my father straighten after mom backed over it. It leaned at an almost impossible angle for any mail person, no matter how talented, to drop mail into. As I got out of the car I was overtaken by the mountain smell I remembered from fifteen years earlier. It hit me as I looked at the mailbox that there hadn’t been mail dropped there in quite some time. My old childhood home was gone, replaced merely by a stand of Beech trees. My father and I once planted a line of fir trees along the road, but they, too, were gone. Various weeds and sprouting trees now grew rampant in the former yard.

The dried off grass blew softly in the breeze, reminding me of many youthful days spent between here and the Hultbergs. It amazed me in that moment how quickly Mother Nature would reclaim what was here and how my Father Time only aided in the effort.
