**“Misunderstand Me” by James Gabriel** 	

I know what you must be thinking...but before you begin thinking I’m swine or a terrible boyfriend, I’d like you to know what I’ve been through with the upset girl I’m standing next to. Ahh, where to begin? I wish to make myself clear, so no one will misunderstand me.

First, the girl standing next to me is no longer my girlfriend… It was our year anniversary. I snuck out of bed early in the morning, to my secret stash of a safe that I’d installed in my office floorboard the year before. Removing the engagement ring I bought her weeks ago made adrenaline shoot up my spine and pound in my head quickly through my body.

I snuck into her sewing room, that’s grotesquely girly and foreign and so I’d not stepped into it since its becoming her sewing room. This is where I stumbled upon her lit up phone screen. We have this rule - no cell phones in our room - and so we leave our phones in our own areas. Her lit up cell phone had an incoming text message from my best friend that read: “I can’t wait for tonight” and had a video attached to it. I press the screen and the video plays. Dread shoots through me, I get cold all over and can feel the blood leaving my face as I watch Rebecca laughing into the camera’s lense naked, my best friend’s voice in the background alight with amusement asking her something I didn’t catch. Slowly I lower the phone, unsure exactly what to do.

Desperately, I try and reign in the rage that’s sparked inside me. In the days of old, they said to guard your heart lest it be broken; for if it’s ever broken, the bearer of said heart could die. I always thought this saying was overly dramatic and embellished. What I was currently feeling though, made me a believer.

When I confronted Rebecca about what I’d seen, the look upon her face crushed all my hopes that I’d been mistaken. I now live alone in downtown New York and agreed to meet Rebecca at her request to discuss her wanting to mend things between us. It’s been 6 weeks and I gave her no hope that reconciliation would be possible. My heart’s still shattered and I’m still trying to pick up the pieces. I try to distract myself in just about every conceivable way, including dating new women. Now I ask you, in regards to the picture you’re looking at, does Rebecca have any right to be upset??

I hope I’ve shed enough light upon my actions in this photo where no one will any longer misunderstand me...
