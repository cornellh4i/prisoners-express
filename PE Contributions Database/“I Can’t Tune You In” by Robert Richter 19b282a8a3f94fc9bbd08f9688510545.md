**“I Can’t Tune You In” by Robert Richter**

Billions of years ago, quasars blasted out huge amounts of energy. Most of the matter in the Universe was falling into collapsars (NOT black holes), so time ran slower back then. As matter accumulated in collapsars, time slowed down in those lower places and sped up everywhere else. If someone had sent you a radio signal from way back then, you’d have to tune in today on a much lower frequency. The frequency of the photons is unchanged - it’s the observers who are speeding up.

Of course, you can’t even begin to understand real physics if you believe in magnetic fields. Everybody knows that parallel electron beams repel each other, while the exact same currents produce an attractive force when they are in wires. The force is proportional to the SQUARE of the electron-proton velocity, showing that Maxwell’s equations represent the difference between two forces, not a single force.

Tune in to the facts! Nope, you can’t, you are trapped by the human need for authority figures. Don’t listen to the only real physicist on Earth, he’s just a prisoner, a nobody. You’d rather spend billions of dollars looking for things that don’t exist, Higgs bosons, dark matter and energy, black holes, and signs of the Big Bang. Give up already and tune in to the truth!
