***Doors Open in the Rain* by Colin VanBilliard**

**Growing up in Dusseldorf, Germany, Lucretia Wagner joined the military at 18, and she wanted to be elite so she contacted the Pentagon. They arranged a meeting, and on January 5th, Lucretia was on a place to the Pentagon. Even though it was raining, she had her umbrella and jacket. When she got to the Pentagon, she went to the front desk and asked for Mike. The lady at the desk showed Lucretia the way to Mike’s office. They walked in, and she announced, “Lucretia Wagner is here to see you.”

The door closed, and Mike said, “Please have a seat. You have an impressive file, and the Pentagon could use you. Lucretia, you want to be elite so here’s your chance: you will be like a hitwoman, taking out big targets. Everything is no paper work. I searched across the world, and I think your skills are special. We want to work with you. What do you say? You’d work with SEAL teams on training, and we’ll put you on small missions until you’re ready.”

“Me working with SEAL teams? I’ll show them they aren’t stronger than a girl,” Lucretia said.

“I’ll call the place where you’ll train for 6 months, and then you will reset out like that umbrella. Thank you. Better get going. I got 4 meetings today. Enjoy yourself, and I’ll be checking up on you.”
