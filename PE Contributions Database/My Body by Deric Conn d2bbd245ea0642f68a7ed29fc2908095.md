**My Body by Deric Conn**

My body is amazing as it has been fearfully and wonderfully made by God. I do not buy into the theory that I was a descendant of some lower life form or that all of creation was some act of random chance. People try to say that science disproves the existence of God, but if we truly look to the facts (a fact can stand up to scrutiny, while a theory has a number of flaws to answer for) that scientists have proven, our line of thinking may change. I know mine has…

For example, did you know that the odds of one single protein molecule forming through the process of random chance is 1 in 10243 - that is 10 with 243 zeros after it - yet one single cell is composed of millions of these protein molecules?

Even the human eye is a natural marvel. It is so marvelous that to duplicate its computing power would take mankind’s building the most advanced computer with a single silicon chip, which is normally the size of a dime, that would cover 10,000 cubic inches and would contain billions of transistors with hundreds of miles of circuit traces. In comparison to the human retina that weighs less than a gram and fills only 0.0003 inches of space, the computer chip would weigh at least 100 pounds. The retina operates off of less than 0.0001 watts of electrical charge. For this most advanced computer to copy the retina’s abilities, it would take the computer to consume 300 watts of power. Are we getting the picture here? I think Charles Darwin did, for he stated in his book, “The Origin of Species,” that “To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the connection of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.”

The human body is truly a complex system with many functions. And the body has an incredible capacity to repair itself. Broken bones mend; cuts to the skin fuse back together; millions of protective antibodies attack infection; muscles’ elasticity allows it to stretch and, if torn, repair themselves.

The average human body has the ability to walk on two feet, to feel and grab ahold of things with two hands, to look, to talk, to listen, and to taste.

I, for one, am grateful for the body that I’ve been given by God. I have long black hair (actually it's dark brown, but it is so dark that others think it’s black), hazel eyes, and favor more of my father’s side of the family on looks. I am 5’10” and weigh 155-165 lbs on average. My vision isn’t 20/20, but I can see a lot more clearly with my glasses.

My body has been through a lot of abuse when I pursued my dream as a professional wrestler.

I love my body and I love the Lord who created it. Thank you God!
