**Gratitude by Edward Finley**

On September 29, 2010, I was transported to Newberry Prison, another secretly known slave plantation. Administrators, or should I say over-seers, assigned me to unit-one which housed sixty prisoners. Prisoners were sectioned off in cubicle settings. The very first cubicle housed thirty-three prisoners, and the other two cubicles housed fourteen prisoners each. I was placed in the second cubicle, in a bunk right next to my brother Atiba, who practiced the Yoruba faith. It was great reuniting with him, despite our oppressive circumstances. I hadn’t seen Atiba since 2006 and we had a lot of catching up to do.

Atiba re-introduced me to the Yoruba faith, which is my faith today. My brother Modibo originally introduced me to the Yoruba faith back in 2007. However, my focus was not on my spirituality at that time; everything Modibo told me went in one ear and out the other.

Fast forwarding to 2010, Atiba began to help me renew myself, by teaching me to unlearn what I’ve learned in this Western culture, and to recall what was stolen and beaten out of my ancestors. Atiba also reunited me with Baba, whom I somewhat met in 2007. However at that time I did not receive any wisdom and knowledge from the elder because I was still blind, deaf, dumb, and naive. I began to study under Baba and Atiba for the nine months I was housed at Newberry, and I must honestly say that I’m FOREVER INDEBTED to them. I’m especially indebted to Baba because he gave me something that would never be taught at any public school. What I received from the elder and Atiba is called “rebirth of consciousness” from left-brain thinking to right-brain thinking, and to Baba and Atiba I love you and my gratitude is beyond words.
