****When I think of “the big city,” my mind goes to San Diego, California where I once laid my head at night. I remember stepping off the plane in February and having to take off the leather jacket I put on in dreary, cold St. Louis hours before. The freeway was a leviathan alive with the endless flow of humanity clamoring to get to their respective destinations. There was not one place along the way where civilization didn’t stake its claim.

My apartment was in an area unlike any I had ever lived. My blonde hair and midwestern accent stood out almost as much as if I had green skin or had grew another head. My neighbors were Mexicans, Asians, and many Ethiopians who donned their native garb. Within a mile of my place, you could indulge the senses in cuisine from any corner of the globe. Also, the 7-11’s on every other block had sushi and even boasted a small but respectable wine selection.

The homeless gathered at the beaches and sold weed to the tourist to earn their meager living. There were people warning about the upcoming apocalypse, government mind control, and a host of other exotic maladies sure to come our way, according to them.

The lowest of the group would huddle in the alleys with their drug of choice: gold spray paint huffed through a paper sack. You could tell who did that by their golden mustaches and goatees. There were also a lot of folks who lived for the glass-like shards of Mexican manufactured crystal meth. Some people put the drug before their job, health, and even food. Zombie-like creatures with open sores constantly licked their dehydrated lips with their eyes darting for the next hustle, the next scam, the next mark…

Movie star quality hookers walked El Cajon Boulevard in their skimpy outfits peddling their wares to whoever would pay their fee. The flesh was tempting, young and fresh, and their eyes could not hide the haunted souls behind them. They reeked of broken Hollywood dreams, still clinging to the latest lies sold lazily by their current pimp.

Southern California stretches into an almost continuous metropolitan area from North of Los Angeles all the way to Mexico. From San Diego headed south, you go through places such as National City, Chula Vista, and San Ysidro until you meet the famous (and infamous) Tijuana, Mexico.

If San Diego and the surrounding area weren’t enough, Tijuana offers debauchery and sin 24 hours a day on tap. Big city style.

What is your scandal? Pick your poison. It is all served down there from pharmacies that offer prescription strength pharmaceuticals over the counter, to cocaine, meth, or black tar heroin delivered to your table at Mr. Tequila. Also, girls line up first thing in the morning on Constitution Ave. offering their pleasures for less than the cost of a decent meal in the U.S., and even the darkest appetites can find their fill with a minimum of investigation.

The “big city” life is fast and loud; it is crowded and completely envelopes your every sense. There is little time for rest as the city practically begs you to revel in all of its offerings. The lights never turn off; the city never sleeps.
