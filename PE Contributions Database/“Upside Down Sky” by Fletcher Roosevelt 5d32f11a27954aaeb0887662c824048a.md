**“Upside Down Sky” by Fletcher Roosevelt**

Stranded above an upside down sky, with a body of water lapping at my ankles I stare into a wildness of vast new possibilities, determined to not look at my world in the rearview…

Man made is the path I took to this point of all of life; stop and go traffic, twists and turns, ups and downs, it's easy to understand what the Obama lady said or her man ran for a second term about how a system will have the audacity to keep “raising the bar” on you, only to keep imaginably obtainable goals just out of reach like greyhounds chasing at a track…

The promise of a paycheck on Thursday around the 1st and 15th of each month is only as solid as a government shutdown… Our beloved Ronald Reagan told one country to break down one wall, only to have some other dude with a memorable shag at the same party to tell a different country he’ll build a wall… Honor thy neighbor!?!

As I look off into the distance the path I shall take has not been cut yet, splash… I drop into the liquid in a stroke dorward and even the ripples man just made goes back as it was as God stands next to the scene with an eraser to vanish my tracks, traces and the bar that thou set aint a Rabbit up a sleeve, stacked deck or optical illusion of any kind.

The journey forward is one which I’ve only just begun and faith is my fuel, in like the forests I’ve had to burn to get there… a prayer is now my filling station and I’ve been pre-approved for an endless love of credit.
