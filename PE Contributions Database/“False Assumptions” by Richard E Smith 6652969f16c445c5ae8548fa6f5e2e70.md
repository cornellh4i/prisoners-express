**“False Assumptions” by Richard E. Smith**

Boom! Boom! Boom! My cell’s steel door echoed from the guard’s repeated kicks. I snapped awake, my heart thundering in panic.

What’s going on? I wondered.

“Smith!” he yelled through the black expanded metal covering my door’s window. “Pack up, you’re on the chain.” (The term “chain” comes from the chain gains of old time prisons when men were physically chained together every time they were transferred around the state. They were still “chained” together. Just now it was done in pairs and with handcuffs instead of chains.)

“Huh?” I squinted through one blue eye. “I’m not on the chain.”

“Pack up,” he repeated before walking off.

*Why would I be on the chain?* I silently asked myself. My groggy brain refused to give me an answer so I kicked off my sheet and packed my property. Despite his gung ho attitude of earlier, several hours passed before the guard returned.

“Come on with that property.” He jammed the pry bar into the tray slot released mechanism and popped the slot open. The tray slot was used to pass meals through – thus the name “tray slot” – but also used as a way to handcuff dangerous prisoners in a safe manner for the guards. I was labeled as one of those dangerous prisoners.

“Where am I going?”

“I don’t know,” he said.

“Yeah you do,” I argued. “The chain list says where I am going.”

“Yours don’t.”

“You’re lying.” I plopped down on my bunk. “I’m not moving until I know what’s going on.”

Call me paranoid or crazy even, but after years of being a high ranking gang member involved in all sorts of no-good, I was leery about taking an unexpected bus ride.

The guard tied of the conversation and clicked the handcuffs open. “Submit to hand restraints.”

“No.”

“Don’t make me call rank,” he warned.

“Tell me where I am going.”

He took a deep breath and exhaled loudly. “Something’s squirrelly,” he said. “The list doesn’t say where you’re going.”

I crossed my arms across my tattooed chest and remained silent.

“Look,” the guard tried, “I’ll find out what I can but I’m not promising anything.”

“Cool,” I answered. “Don’t mess me over.”

He didn’t.

“You’re on a special chain for McConnell.”

McConnell Unit? Why was I going there? I didn’t want to leave Connally. Although the Connally Unit was declared one of the most violent prisons in the state, I enjoyed the place. It was home even though it wasn’t always the best place to be.

The administration decided it wouldn’t be my home anymore.

“Smith!” a stocky guard called me as the bus pulled up at McConnell’s gate house.

“Yeah?”

“Get in the cage.” He jabbed a finger at a small fenced area.

“I’m supposed to be staying here?” I replied.

He shook his head.

“Where am I going?” I stepped into the cage.

“Don’t know.” He slammed the doors hut and snapped a brass lock on my cage. “And really don’t care.” He walked away.

“You’ll care in a minute.” I yelled at his gray-shirted back. “Get me some rank or bring the team!” (S.O.R.T. Team – Special Operations Response Team – is a group of five guards wearing riot gear. They deal with unruly prisoners in an unruly manner.)

The guard stormed off. Five minutes later a sergeant came to my cage. I knew him as a guard on Connally before he received his rank.

“Smith,” he said. “Why are you tripping?”

“I just want to know where I’m going.”

“That’s it?” he asked. “Give me a minute.”

When he returned I knew something was amiss. The sergeant was smiling! My stomach twisted in anticipation. Smiling sergeants usually meant bad news to me.

“What’s up?” I waited, uncertain if I really wanted to hear the answer.

“How long you been in seg?”

“Thirteen years.”

He nodded. “It’s over.”

“Huh?”

He smiled wider, if that was even possible. “A special van’s coming to support you to the Ramsey Unit. You’re getting released from seg.”

I was getting out of seg! I couldn’t believe it. After almost thirteen years of solitary confinement I was going to be free. True I’d remained imprisoned, and even take a vocational trade. More importantly, I could hug my parents after years of physical isolation.

I couldn’t believe this was really happening. What began as a journey of despair had morphed into the grandest dream. This road trip would be the beginning of a new lifetime – a life of hope, happiness, and achievement.

This unexpected blessing would be a never-ending journey of re-discovering who I was meant to be.

This road trip was awesome!
