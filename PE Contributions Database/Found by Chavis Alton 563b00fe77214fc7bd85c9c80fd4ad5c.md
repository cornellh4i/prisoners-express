**Found by Cambren Thomas**

So many lose when they become a part of the cold, callous prison system. However, I often feel like I am at the polar opposite end of the spectrum. Everyday that I have been locked away, I have had a chance to find…

I have found better ways to spend my time. Outside of these walls, binge-TV like Netflix and Hulu, the internet, social media, smartphones, apps, video games, intoxicants, vices of the sensual and sexual variety were all holding me back from my true potential in life. Without these major distractions, I have been able to return to more simplistic and beneficial ways of occupying my time. I am reading so much more now and enjoying myself as I am getting reacquainted with both classic and modern literature--and most importantly, my Bible! I have furthered my education and plan on earning another college degree, one in Theological Studies. I have completed numerous mail correspondence programs and bible schools. I am also working to help my peers rise about the madness of this place by working out with them, talking with them, and simply listening to their many stories and grievances.

Also, I have found my creativity once again! I was once spread too thin to focus, but now, I am completely focused. Even through the minor distractions of monotonous television and the occasional immature inmate drama, I have been able to tap into my imagination more fully now. My mind has become a “raging torrent” (Blazing Saddles reference) of colorful words, images, and ideas. I literally cannot stop my pen from writing at times. I go through legal pad after legal pad with new thoughts that I meticulously bring to fruition. I am so fulfilled by this boost in my creativity, and I happily look forward to my literary future--inside and outside of this concrete and steel!	I have found the people who really care about me. My situation definitely drew a line in the sand, with many of the people who I thought knew and loved me. Some chose to step across to the condemning side of the line, but my family has been unmoved and right by my side. They have supported me from the start of this arduous journey and will continue to be with me until I am back home in their arms. I am so thankful for my family--my tried and true loved ones. The “real” have sifted from the “fake” like shining gold from mud!	Moreover, I have found unwavering faith in God. Since day one of my incarceration, I have truly felt His presence and protection within and all around me. I have a renewed bond with my Creator and have rededicated my life to His Holy Word and spiritual guidance. God is *real* and omnipresent in every aspect of my daily living now. I was so far away from peace before, on the outside, but through my faith, I will continue to find true peace as the years continue onward.

Lastly, I have found, in some odd way, an appreciation for this drastic change in my life. My eyes are wide open now! I have officially graduated from boyhood to manhood at 30 years of age! As the lyrics of “Amazing Grace” so lovingly assert, “I was once lost, but now I’m found, was blind, but now I see…” In a situation as dire as mine, I should honestly be curled up in a ball, somewhere in isolation on the cusp of crazy. But I am not and never will be! I like that I will be challenged to grow against massive odds. I will hit “free” soil as more of a refined swan rather than an ugly duckling--no doubt about it! I thank God everyday for the humility and courage I have found here, and I will continue to nurture that. I have not found one speck of depression or gloom in my life since being incarcerated, and I am so grateful!

I have truly found myself!
