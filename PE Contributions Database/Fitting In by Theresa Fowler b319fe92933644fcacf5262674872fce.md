I believe that our society is separated into many social divisions. Each individual seems to gravitate towards other like individuals. I still haven't found where I fit in this life, and at times, I feel like I'm wandering aimlessly along. Fitting in is a hard subject to write about, mainly because I don't know where I fit in. I've made a decision to enjoy life and every aspect of it while I'm searching for where I fit in. In the past, I really never felt as if I fit in. I got married, moved around, and used drugs as a way to fit in. Still, I was dissatisfied with my life. For many years, I felt like I was just drifting along, going through the motions of living. I didn't feel as if I belonged, no matter whom I was with or what I was doing. Even though the drugs I used gave me the illusion of a place where I could fit in, I was restless. I often wondered if I would always feel this way.

Now, I'm in jail and have been for 6 years. I realize that I can use this time wisely, associating with others who want to have better lives once they're released, or I can make the unwise decision of being around people who still get in trouble. I enjoy being with people who have positive attitudes and a great outlook on life. Until I'm released, these are the people I want to "fit in" with. Once I'm free, my main priority is working on reestablishing relationships with my various family members. My family has always been open and accepting of me along with my many faults. Never have they turned their backs on me. I know that I will have a place to fit in with them. I look forward to building better relationships with them.

I will make new friends, and have a newer and better outlook on life and the future that's before me. My past will always be there, but the future is what I will focus on. I'll find my place to fit in, and this time it will be as a productive individual who enjoys life and being surrounded by others who also enjoy life. I don't know right now where I'll be, but I do know with determination and perseverance I will succeed.
