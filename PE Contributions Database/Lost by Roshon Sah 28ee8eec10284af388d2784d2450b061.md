**by Roshon Sah**

I am not from United States. I came to America in 2005. I came for my college on a student visa. I was shocked to see all the tall buildings and interlinked highways. It all felt like a giant maze. All the roads and buildings looked alike. All the franchise buildings had the same shape and size. I felt like lost.

Then a year later I learned to drive and bought a car. I was scared to death while driving on the highway. And finally a day came when I got lost while driving on my way to car shop. I was desperately trying to get back to my apartment. I called one of my buddies. He told me to stop at the nearest gas station and ask the clerk for direction. It worked, and I found my way back.

Again seven years later I feel like Iâ€™m lost. I don't know if I will be lost forever this time? My life took a sudden turn. I was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. I went on to become an inmate from a college student. Am I truly lost forever?
