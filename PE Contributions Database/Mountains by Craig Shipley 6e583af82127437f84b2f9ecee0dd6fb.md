**by Craig Shipley**

These mountains were my home for many years. I grew up here, and I know every creek, crevice, mountain top, and hill around this area. There are no sunsets or sunrises that can surpass the beauty of this place.

Unfortunately I no longer live in these mountains. This photo was the last taken before the nuclear bomb destroyed my home. Now all that remains is a black hole filled with soot and ashes.

The U.S. Government claims that it was a very unfortunate accident for the bomb to hit my home. I have been looking into this for over five years and have found that the government knew this would take place. Evil lives in the White House and inside the hearts and minds of many of our elected officials.

I will find the person who pressed the button that destroyed my home. That person is my nemesis and will be destroyed. I cannot stand by and do nothing while othersâ€™ lives just move on. I will be vindicated one way or another. Failure is not an option.
