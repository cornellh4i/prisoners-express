"The Daughter I’ll Never Have" by Matthew Fox

She listens to a type of music that is an offshoot of Rock ‘n’ Roll. Unfortunately, it’s not the early innovators she likes, but this new hybrid of crap that record companies are pushing out these days. Hearing these contemporary bands, all I can think about are their ancestors that are so much better. But I keep these thoughts to myself when I buy her the new digital download of one of her favorite bands. She laughs and docks it to a stereo, playing it loud. I get through the first two songs before I have to leave her room. I’ve tried to introduce her to the musicians that matter, but they don’t stick. I’m just glad she inherited my taste in music. It could be worse. Instead, I might be listening to that ear-bleeding pop-music currently in vibe.

My daughter has my nose and chin but we’re not completely alike. She does better in school than I ever did. History and English were the only subjects I was interested enough to do well in. She does well in everything and actually likes school. When I went, I detested every part of it; the ritual of attendance and programming with safe subjects, the forced interactions.

But my girl is immune to my cynicism. She enjoys the experience. I often consider to what extent my dropping out has affected her. But it didn’t. She has a natural optimism that I know I gave her because that optimism has kept me alive today.

Anyhow, she likes school, although she’s skipped on occasion. Just a class or two. It’s good that she’s not a complete tool for the system. A little rebellion never hurt anyone; it’s the total kind that causes so much mischief.

My daughter just turned sixteen and has grown up so quickly. The little girl I once pushed on a swing is now dating and driving. Her independence makes me sad but proud. Having to let her go is like taking off a limb. I knew these days would come though there’s no way to prepare for them. But I still feel her presence, the phantom limb.

I see her when she’s alone, as I pass by her room or while she’s lounging on the couch or studying at a desk. I look at this small miracle of evolution that I’ve created and know she’s the best thing I’ve done, and ever will do. She’s made me a better man and is more than just an alternate version of myself. She is an answer to the future I will not see. But, to create something good for a future you won’t see takes incredible selflessness and it is this enduring legacy that is the ultimate fulfillment of man.

This is the daughter I’ll never have.
