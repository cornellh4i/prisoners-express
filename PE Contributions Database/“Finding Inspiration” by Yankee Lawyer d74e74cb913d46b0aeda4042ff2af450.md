**“Finding Inspiration” by Yankee Lawyer**

God breathed into Adam and a lump of clay became a man. The first human being was truly inspired.

For thousands of years, succeeding generations sought inspiration with varying degrees of success. Then descendants of Abraham began assembling the Bible. It started as five scrolls, the Torah which Cristians call the Pentateuch. Today, we have 66 books plus the Apocrypha. The Holy Bible is the biggest selling book in history, and still inspires people around the world.

Other books also inspire people, such as the #3 best-seller Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. So do some plays, movies, magazines, and websites. Some inspire love and good behavior. Others like rap inspire violence, drug abuse, promiscuity, and lawlessness.

Before seeking inspiration from a work of literature or art, one does well to consider the source, as well as the subject. The National Monument to the Forefathers and the Statue of Liberty are inspirational; but so are the nude statues of Emperor Hadrian’s boyfriend scattered across Europe.

There is nothing wrong with appreciation of a human’s physical beauty when it leads to building a family and raising children in the knowledge and love of God. This is His plan for us; but lust can also lead to uncleanness, licentious behavior, and promiscuity.

As an adolescent, I was inspired by Sandy, who would never be mine. I was inspired by my high school biology teacher, and later by my college history instructor. They helped me become the man I am today. In the end, reliable and lasting inspiration does not come from any Greek muse; it is found only in the word of God.
