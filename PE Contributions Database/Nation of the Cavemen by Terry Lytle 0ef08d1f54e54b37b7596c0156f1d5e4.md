**Nation of the Cavemen by Terry Lytle**

This is the cave that I shall RUN to now that people who forget their history, about oppressors: Joe Biden wrote all the mass incarceration scripts, of his grand facade of America, not being safe. Kamala Harris did NOT hold illegalities and policies, accountable in Orange County. Just to be “Democratic” in the play called “Democracy,” the frustrated youth and troubled old forgot the greatest maxims known to man: better the snake you know for it’s the lesser of two evils.

As a nation of principles, we watch the ignorant masses call Trump to the principal’s office: they are taught this, in our public schools, to punish - as the masses - all minorities, were punished. Obama, nothing more than a puppet that began the clean up of Biden, changing crack disparity from 100 tol, to 18 tol - still, overly illegal, unjust, and oppressive. Yet you - “America” - wonder why criminals become criminals. Wonder why men in American prisons become career offenders. Wonder how a man can leave prison with so much hatred, he hates all whites. It is you, the masses - the blacks - who consistently vote for the demon party whose only contributions to the unemployed is the mass incarceration prison building boom of the ‘90s and prison industry! That, incidentally locks up blacks! You blame Trump - in your weak minded needs to blame, to scream, to stick out your tongues, don’t even remember Biden who stands there with one hand holding a bucket of crap he will dip his other hand in and smack your tongue with a handful of. “Eat up, you SOB’s, you super predators, you gang”.
