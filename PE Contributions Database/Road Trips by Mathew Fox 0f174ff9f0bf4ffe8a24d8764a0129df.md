**"Road Trips" by Matthew Fox**

Shackled, shuffling and sweating, I collapsed into the seat of the transport van. The summer sun was a golden firework of glory shimmering off metal and concrete glass. With a fury it pummels its way into the buildings, wilting plants, and curling papers.

The driver shuts the door and walks around the van to his side. The air doesn’t rush in when he opens it, but floats in a few feet and then deflates. With the two of us inside, and the door shut, the heat wraps around our bodies and slowly wrings out moisture. Finally, he switches on the engine and cool AC blasts out from the vents.

The driver is wearing the brown slacks and tan button-up shirt of a county corrections officer. The colors of authority. As we leave the campus I look around and see incoming employees coming back to work, some still have a plastic cup full of soda, bought from wherever they went for lunch break. Most are smiling and laughing even while sweat streaks. Those not smiling at least seem to be enjoying the break from work. I don’t’ blame them. We are a sad lot.

Every time I’m taken off-campus on these trips I’m always reminded of the stark divide between us;1 the insane and the sane. Leaving the ward reinforces the boundary between freedom and captivity, which ultimately defines the happy and unhappy.

Outside the wire, things crystalize and knowledge comes, but at a terrible price. I now know the value of being able to sweat outdoors any damn time I please. I can appraise the basics of solitude, quietness, and the setting sun and tell you how priceless they are.

The due for this knowledge however is shattering and once paid, you can never relinquish it. Or more accurately, it never relinquishes you.
