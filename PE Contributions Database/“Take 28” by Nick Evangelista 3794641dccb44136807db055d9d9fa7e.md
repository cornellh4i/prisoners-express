**“Take 28” by Nick Evangelista**

“Cut!” screamed David Braham-Hyde into the megaphone. “Cut, cut, cut!” he repeated, tipping over his monogrammed director’s chair as he leapt to his feet. He gripped a handful of his long brown hair and pulled hard as if his frustration required even more animation. The set was quiet now except for the ambient noise of the city street.

The director exhaled loudly in an effort to reduce his tension. “Laura, Lanai, ladies good job, everybody 5 minutes please.”

“Not you!” David snapped as he fixed his gaze on the third actor in the scene. “Troy, come here son.” He beckoned the young male actor, trying hard not to do so through clenched teeth.

“I nailed that last one, didn’t I sir?” The director closed his eyes before he spoke, conveying to anyone else who might be watching that he was trying-good God was he trying. “Troy,” he began, gathering what patience he had left.

“My boy – if I had asked you to turn your entire head around one hundred and eighty degrees like – well like some sort of man owl then yes, yes my boy, I guess you could say that you nailed it!” David looked up at the tall stagehand turned actor and said, “Troy, that’s not what I asked you for is it? I know this is not your calling son.” The director said before he could answer, “You, sir are a best-boy, a gaffer and unlike the ladies, you have no formal actor’s training. But-I know you can understand instructions, right?” Troy’s mouth opened to respond but David’s index finger held in the symbolic manner in front of his face to mean ‘hold that thought’. ‘I shouldn’t be here right now!’ David thought to himself. ‘I should be anywhere but here, this thing should have wrapped days ago!’ He pondered his streak of bad luck. What began as a simple, straightforward 30 second commercial shoot for the national eyewear chain Vision Place, was now a tragic comedy which might soon place David in the hospital attached to a cardiac monitor.

The project, Seeing Double? It was scheduled to start and wrap shooting in a single day. That was 4 days ago. The lead male actor: Johann Wetton Endicott, was in a hospital lying in a coma. One hour prior to the call, the perfectly sculpted and seasoned actor had his face buried in a script for a different project while walking to what he felt would be nothing more than a two take effort on his part. In what one witness described as a homage to a Bugs Bunny cartoon, a seemingly secured bundle of roofing material 3 stories above Endicott’s fabulous face gave way. Gravity obeyed its unbreakable law and seconds later the talent lay unconscious as sirens wailed in the distance.

Yesterday, in his office, David met with the project’s sponsor who also happened to be Troy’s uncle. The director took a long pull on his bourbon enhanced cup of coffee. He knew what was coming. “He’s a natural! I promise you Davey boy, he just needs a break and well, here you go right?” David moaned a sound that came off as a half hearted refusal. “C’mon Hyde, “ the sponsor pressed on, “as a favor to me. One I know you won’t regret!”

David had nothing but regret. He wanted nothing more than this mountain of a mishap to be over with. He was 2 days late for an assistant director’s gig in LA. The unfortunate circumstances and David’s reputation bought him a reprieve, but he needed to wrap now- today!

“OK Troy, “ he said calmly. “You can do it.” He looked at the talent as he coached him again. “Just ever so slight, look at Lana as you go by, subtle - you do know what I mean by subtle, right?”

Troy nodded looking like a bobble head doll. David thought Troy had a better chance of flying than acting but “here we go again” he thought.

“Ok places!” David barked into the megaphone. “This is it people- this is the one!” “My god, please…” he said under his breath as he passed the loud-speaker to his assistant and sat back in his chair.

“Quiet, please!” The assistant pleaded. “Seeing Double? Take 28 - and…”
