**No More Novembers by Mitch Obrecht**

We stared at the TV in shocked silence. It looked like something out of a bad sci-fi movie, but every station ran the same news.

They landed - thousands of ships, across the globe. Within hours, the major cities were gone. Not destroyed, exactly. It was as if a giant ice cream scoop picked up the cities and transported them… somewhere.

My roommate Mark looked out the window. All he could see was a greenish-gray mist. He couldn’t even make out the house next door.

For hours - days, maybe? - we watched the news. It wasn’t until Brian asked where the signal was coming from that we started to freak out. Atlanta was just… gone. So how was CNN still on the air?

We’re running out of supplies. Tomorrow… tomorrow, we’ll venture outside, into the mist. For now, we’ll keep watching until sleep claims us.
