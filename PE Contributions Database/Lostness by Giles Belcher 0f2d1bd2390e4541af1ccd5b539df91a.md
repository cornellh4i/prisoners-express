**Lostness by Giles Belcher**

Staring at the person in front of me, seeing a brown-eyed gaze lost in thought? Female at least, but I am guessing at that assumption. Just trying to figure out if the person is lost in thought over something, stoned out, or looking at something or someone? I am somewhat startled by the gaze and lack of expression on the personâ€™s face! Are random thoughts, memorize, or just utter lostness swirling around inside? Is the past being remembered, some idea of a truth coming to life, maybe good or bad intentions? Just very hard to say. A shadowed face staring out, lost in thought, memory, or whatever has started this will soon be done!
