**"Return to Me" by Kevin Vorshak**

September twenty-third. As Sung Li watched all the events transpiring on CNN, that date reverberated in her head, oozed down her spine, and congealed in her belly. What did it mean. How uttered those words “Prepare, for September twenty-third approaches” on her cell phone barely an hour ago?

Sung Li tried to shake it off as a cruel prank. The caller ID displayed no name, no number, nothing at all. The voice resembled that of her husband Charles, but he’d succumbed to pancreatic cancer the previous year.

She picked the remote up from her lap and muted CNN. She then retrieved her bible from the coffee table. Charles and become almost fanatical the last few years of his life to reading prophecy and other materials about the so-called “End Times”. He stressed to Sung Li the need to keep a close relationship with Jesus Christ.

She had maintained that. She began that relationship in a water-filled Vietnamese ditch where her aunt, her cousin, and her cousin’s son died. When her aunt jerked and slumped against the ditch, Sung Li know they’d been spotted. She prayed as bullets struck around them and then pain exploded in her head.

She came around sometime later, blood soaked and with throbbing pain in the back of her head. She felt the gash left by the bullet, which fortunately only grazed her. Her family lay dead around her. Their killers must have believed her dead as well.

Sung Li didn’t understand why she survived. She didn’t understand why God allowed her family to die, but she did believe that God spared her.

Eventually she found herself in Saigon. There she met Charles, who appointed himself as her protector. He listened to her, helped her come to terms with what happened in that ditch, and fell in love with her. He brought her to America.

Now she wondered if he still tried to look after her. Charles always felt that America more and more turned its back on God and that God would send a sign. To him, September 11, 2001 was that sign. Seven years later came the crash of 2008. Still he fretted of America’s lack of faith and feared the coming of 2015. He always pointed out the growing civil unrest, the simmering and anger glorified by the media, and what he perceived as immorality encouraged by the government.

Sung Li gave him a sympathetic ear. She know how quickly a country could dissolve into chaos. In the past year following his death, the news seemed to make the entire world appear to be going mad. What if the call somehow did come from Charles? What if the call portended another even worse financial meltdown, or even another horrendous attack on the nation’s soil?

Impossible. The call had to be only what it appeared--a prank. Yet, the phone call persisted in tormenting her thoughts. Fumbling for the remote, she shut off the TV and sat back in the quiet, lost in her thoughts. Then, while her eyes remained closed, she randomly opened her bible and placed her finger against the page. It was something she’d often seen Charles do.

Opening her eyes, she red the verse from the book of Malachi 3:7 -- “‘Return to Me and I will return to you,’ says the Lord Almighty.”
