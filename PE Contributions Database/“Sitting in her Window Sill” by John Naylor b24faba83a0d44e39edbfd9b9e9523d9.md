**“Sitting in her Window Sill” by John Naylor**

“I always wanted one of those, but they leak.”

“Do what now?” I’d asked, half listening. I thought, *Well then you should have a big windowsill to sit in.* We built our own house after all. She declined, the ambition of youth. She wasn’t surprised and felt loved all the same. Sometimes people just figure ways around.

Well then again, I guess some may just call it substitution. We used to have a microwave stand. Fact is, I’ve been in the custody of the state for fifteen years now. So I guess I’ll just have to assume that we still have it. There was a vacation many years ago where we stopped by Bass Pro shops. And they had the largest selection of Lodge cast iron we ever saw. Mom got every Dutch oven she wanted. And man, that’s a lot of iron. Since we had a suburban [home] the transportation back to Indiana wasn’t a problem. Maybe there’ll be a saying one day: “One woman’s window is another woman’s Dutch oven.” I helped clean the factory coating off and season. And I made some excellent sloppy joes with biscuits a few times. Though I should’ve used them more while Dad was still alive and I was free. November is next month as I write this. That’s when he passed on last year.
