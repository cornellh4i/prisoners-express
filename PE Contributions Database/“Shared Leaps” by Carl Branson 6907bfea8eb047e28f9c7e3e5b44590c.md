**“Shared Leaps” by Carl Branson**

As prisoner-authors, I suspect that we all share one or more “leaps of faith” which have us where we are now.

The reason behind the conduct for which we have been convicted is the first in a series of shared leaps of faith. On this point, I believe we fall within one of three categories: (1) we thought our conduct was *not* criminal, (2) we knew our conduct was criminal, but we were convinced we were smart enough to avoid “getting caught,” or (3) considered the conduct worth whatever the cost. Regardless of which category you or I fall into, rest assured that there is at least one other among us manning the oar on the other side of the boat.

The second shared leap of faith was trusting our attorney--be it paid or appointed counsel. We were convinced that the attorney(s) would do their best to either: (1) “get us off” or (2) obtain a more lenient sentence. What we forgot is that even with attorneys, at least half of their graduating class is in the bottom 50% of the ranking. How many of us thought to ask where our attorney ranked in their class? Hmm…

Let’s not forget post-conviction proceedings, be it direct appeal, habeas corpus, or some statutory form of action available to challenging the legality of the conviction or sentence. Again, we trust our attorney(s) to do their best but more often than not are disillusioned by the quality of their performance versus the quantity of their promises made. Since the post-conviction arena seems to be open continuously in one form or another to combatants, this allows us to visit the abbey of the “jailhouse lawyer.” Observation of his cloistered society yields mixed results. These persistent students of law occasionally make inroads and obtain relief where trained attorneys have failed. A leap from this cliff requires caution and far more questions than we failed to pose to our attorneys.

There may be other “leaps of faith” common to us all who have gone through the criminal justice system. These areas just reviewed qualify as the “big three” which I believe all prisoner-authors can relate to.
