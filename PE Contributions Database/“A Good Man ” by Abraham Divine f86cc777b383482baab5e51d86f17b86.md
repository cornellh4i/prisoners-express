**“A Good Man?” by Abraham Divine**

****I met a man today on the train. He said his name is Bill, I told him “My name is Abraham”. We shook hands. While we were shaking hands, I noticed something strange about his hands. Mr. Bill had tattoos on his hands.

I asked, “Mr. Bill why do you have tattoos on your hands?”

Mr. Bill said with a smile, “I did it because I do not like to lose a bet.”

“I bet people everywhere I go that I can keep an eye on them even if I cover my face.” I said “No way”, he said “Bet”. So I bet Mr. Bill, and he showed me how he won all those bets. He simply put his hands in front of his face, I knew then he had won.
