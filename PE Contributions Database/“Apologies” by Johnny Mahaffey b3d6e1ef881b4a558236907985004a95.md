**“Apologies” by Johnny Mahaffey**

Having remorse for my thoughts, or actions that are wrong, is one thing; but having to be apologetic towards criminals that have not - nor do they intend to - change their ways, is not my nature.

I DO NOT like child molestors, or sex offenders in general - especially those in here that make no efforts to change. They’re not enrolled in “sex offender” classes (only those close to release are required to take the classes); but thousands need it), every single one of them with sex crime related charges should be forced to take anti-Chester classes for the duration of their sentence.

I will not apologize for my thoughts; I am not the only one with these opinions. I’m a teacher, and a sizable percentage of my students are sex offenders. I remain unbiased in class - but outside of class, the things I see, the true nature of sex-offenders, is deplorable!

One of the first things a Pedo does here is pick up a Bible, and make sure everyone sees it; some will even teach a class on it. Imagine that, a pedo-preacher. They walk around, sporting a cross,with Bible in hands - spewing lies about being pro-education or programs, claiming to want rehabilitation. But when the cell door closes, and prisoner administrative eyes are elsewhere, their true nature emerges. And I’m supposed to apologize for them? For what? Knowing who they truly are…

A lot of people are owed apologies - but sex offenders are not among them. I am an advocate for harsher punishments for sex offenders; a murderer deserves less time than a sex offender because the sex-offender subjects a victim to a living death.
