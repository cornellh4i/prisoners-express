**by Catherine LaFleur**

I don’t think my boyfriend realized my sincerity. There, I was standing on the couch preparing to leap onto the coffee table. “What are you doing,” he asked. “It should be perfectly obvious,” I gasped breathlessly, nailing a perfect landing on the sturdy wood. I briefly thanked Broyhill for manufacturing such blocky styles. I paused to assess the desirability of the love seat or the recliner. Both equally leapable from my perch on the coffee table. “The thing is awake!”

George shook his head. “What thing? You mean under the couch?”

George and I had just finished watching a horror movie which had the inevitable effect of making up The Thing That Lives Under the Couch. One of my greatest Cthulhu bogey fears. Even though I’m an adult, it still bothers me. When George asked me whether I had seen the scary movie, I should have confessed then that I can’t watch them, not even the campy ones like Freddy Kreuger. I don’t mean I do the fake girly, squeaky thing. Something deep in the hadal region of my brain awakens, and I get that heebie-jeebies feeling, that fight or flight response. And for me, it’s always flight because The Thing has huge claw-tipped, sucker-padded tentacles and is hungry. Always hungry.

I was infected by Twilight Zone Magazine as a young teenager. Someone, and I suspect my dad, gave me a subscription to the ‘zine for my 13th birthday. Exactly what was he trying to say? Thirteen is a bad number? In the first issue were two stories that thrill-chilled me. One was by Stephen King about a monster living in a lake and teenagers trapped on a raft. Another was about something cool and gray living under the bed that snatches the unwary by the uncovered feet and drags them down, down down. And thus was born my fear of The Thing That Lives Under the Couch (and/or Bed). It only shows up after you have seen a scary movie or TV show.

As I determined which direction was best to leap to confuse the monster, George got up and moved to the stairs. Obviously this is something a person in league with The Thing would do to reassure the victim that it is okay to get off of the furniture. He’s laughing hysterically as I make flight from the table to the loveseat which has no dust ruffle and is perched on long, slender spindles, thereby leaving no space for the tentacled Thing to hide.

He asked me if I realized how ridiculous I looked, and so I snarled, “Just ask yourself if you’re being helpful. Because you aren’t!” George turns and whistles for Gracey, our Whippet who needs one last outing for the night. She ran into the room and sniffed interestedly around the loveseat. Aha! I think there’s something there, but Gracey is obviously lulled by whatever “it” is. Hmmmmmm.

Just as I fly onto the rag rug, George and Gracey disappear out the door. I had just enough time to scramble and snick the lock into place. But what I was really thinking was crap, Windigos! George gave an inquiring glance over his shoulder, and I mouthed the word “Windigo” as I twisted the blinds shut over the glass window. He really shouldn’t have picked a movie about those ghoulies. Especially since we are vacationing in the mountains, and everyone knows it’s the Windigo’s favorite lurking spot.

I charged up the stairs, hair prickling on the backs of my arms, not because it’s cold but because The Thing has probably snuck under the open risers while my back was turned. I successfully reached the top of the stairs and flew into the bed, wriggling under the covers. Undressing, I tossed my clothes onto the chest under the window. I laid there contemplating the fact that I am the sort of girlfriend who locks a man out with the Windigo. I laid there listening to the cabin settle for the night, creaks and a breeze blowing over the shingles. There was a large thump and the click of nails on the hardwood floors. Obviously not a Windigo--they don’t have opposable thumbs to use a door key.

George thumped up the stairs then stood at the foot of the bed, removing his clothing. Sliding in, he whispered, “You’re cold.”

I whispered back, “I’m always cold when I’m scared.” I rolled toward him.

“Don’t be scared,” he said. My nose fits right under his ear. We lay there for a moment before I whispered back.

“George.”

“Yeah?”

“I’m not cold anymore.” I let the covers slip off my feet. His body moved to cover mine, and we kissed for a long time, touching everywhere.
