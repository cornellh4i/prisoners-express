**Do You Believe in Magic? by Anthony Johnson**

The summer sky was dark chocolate smeared with clouds of fluffy white meringue and the majestic Himalayan mountain range strained against the storm crawling up its back.

Three o’clock in the afternoon, we’d been scheduled to reach base comp five around noon. I knew we weren’t going to make it there today. The demeanor of our Tibetan team had changed as we’d began to cross the final plateau. Madoo, the lead guide told me that it was because the local team believed mystical spirits play tricks in the summer storms.

“Mr. Madoo, I’m thirty years old, an attorney, and this is my second trip here- I don’t believe in mystical spirits, and just for your information, tricks are for kids; so save it” I snapped. Madoo looked away as he said that the best thing to do would be to stake down the tents, get some food, and wait for the storm to pass. I was restless.

I loaded my Nikon Zoom with Kodak 200 for some photos of the encroaching storm, found a grassy spot directly facing the mountain and waited.

...Caressed. A slow wind, warmed by distance and laced with traces of evergreen, so fragrant, so intoxicating, so rhythmic- I fell into its magical lullaby. Cradled…

“Rock-a-by-baby...the cradle will rock...go to sleep sweet baby…” Mama’s voice echoed soft, distant, safe…

“Willow wake up you sleepy head, Dada up early and he’s in a hurry to get to the sale barn,” Mom chirped. “And you know he don’t like waiting on us girls. So rise and shine, that is if you want to be there when we pick up your pony.”

Mom brushed the hair from my face and planted a kiss on the end of my freckled nose that smelled like fresh brewed coffee and honey buns.

“Lets go!” Mama used her ‘I mean it’ voice. She pulled the bedcovers back, and… “So you’re dressed already I see.”

On the long and boring ride to the sale barn Dad was quieter than usual. Most of the time I could read his moods, but this morning- weird; Mom wasn’t saying much either. Here I was, excited about getting my first pony, and my parents were acting as if we were on the way to a cousin’s funeral.

Dad takes the exit for the Flying W truck stop. I was so glad. I had to pee, and one of Dad’s road rules was- don’t ask to stop and pee.

“Dam! Damn!! Damn it!!” shouted my father. “Did you see how that car cut me off-- caused me to clip the curb with the new tire I just put on the horse trailer, did ya’ll see it?”

I noticed a smile flash like day lightening across Mom’s face; I held most of a giggle back, but Dad, being Dad heard a hiccup of laughter that managed to escape me.

“Willow.” Dad’s voice rolled like slow thunder. “You got something to say young lady?”

“NO SIR.”

“Do you or your mother find anything funny about me hitting that curb?”

Mom looked at me and I looked at Mom, and we burst out laughing.

Dad stopped in front of the gas pumps--he looked at Mom, then he looked at me and said, “hitting the curb...was their fault...not mine.” Me and Mom cackled like two caged hens as the rooster turned three shades of red.

“Mom, open the door. I gotta pee bad!”

As I cleared the truck door I shouted back at Dad, “Not your fault, uh!”

Mom was right on my heels laughing and screaming… as I grabbed the door I heard her say, “Willow, you are sooooo bad.”

I don’t believe in Santa Claus or Flying Reindeer; I know I’m getting a pony and I’m at the sale barn, but still-- I’ve got a bandana tied across my eyes… parents, go figures.

“Surprise!” shouted my parents as Dad pulled the banada from my eyes.

“It’s old” I said at last.

“No Willow. It’s not. It’s a Shetland Pony,” said Dad.

“But, but it don’t even look like a pony Dad,” was all I could think to say.

Dad just nodded…

Mom looked puzzled…

“Willow, Shetland Ponies are supposed to be, well, long-haired. Sweetie just look at the way he’s staring at you; he likes you. And look, Dad bought you a new saddle; so go say hello to Shaggy- your new pony.”

Mom patted me on the back and pushed me forward…

“Pssss- Pssss, Willow wake up you sleepy head,” whispered Madoo.

“Uh? What the… Shaggy? No! It can’t be.”

“Willow, shhh, don’t be frightened, it’s just been standing there staring at you-- I think it likes you.”

“Madoo...”

“Where’d? Ah, how’d it get here?” I ask.

“Don’t know,” confessed Madoo.

“Madoo...”

“That’s… that’s the saddle my dad gave me when I was thirteen.”

“The summer storm Willow.”

“Madoo...”

“Yes, Willow?”

“Make it go away...”
