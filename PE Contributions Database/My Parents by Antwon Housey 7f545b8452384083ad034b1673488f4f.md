**“My Parents” by Antwon Housey**	

I know most people who are given the chance to speak about their parents always have pleasant and soothing words to share. That’s great when it’s the reality of their memories. As for me, I’m going to express those emotions that are submerged within my subconscious. On February 28, 1992, a handsome baby boy was pulled from the womb of his mother. Unbeknownst to the little newborn was that the woman from whom he was pulled totally hated the father who offered his assistance in the conception process. She had such disdain for the father that she attempted to kill him with a fatal knife stab through the skull. This is because he was entertaining the company of another female while she was seven months into her pregnancy. Now, this little act of violence set forth many different events. My father, whom I only had the opportunity to meet once when I was 14 years old, used that as an excuse to leave Savannah and head back home to New York City. This little act of violence also presented my mother with the opportunity to lie to me about who my biological father was. I grew up calling a stranger my father. My mother disliked my biological father's great passion, and the more I matured, the more she began to see the resemblance I shared with my father. She did not see the face of her newborn. I never really figured out why my mother said things to me that I know a mother should never tell her only son. I always wondered why she cared and nurtured for her step children more than she did for me. It is still confusing to this day how she could throw me out of her house, while knowing I was on parole. She seems to only care and nurture me when I’m in a controlled environment. She told me once, “I told your daddy that you were in prison, and he said why are you telling me, that’s his problem, not mine”. I understood the logic behind his words, and I now understand the psychological torture behind hers. As for my parents, I’m grateful that they met, fucked, and birthed me. However, I vow to never treat nor abandon my children the way my parents do/did to me. My mother only treats me the way she does because she still hasn’t given up the pain my father brought to her. Maybe, she is telling her absolute truth whenever she says, “I should’ve swallowed you instead!” I thank my parents for having me, and I also love because they’ve shown me the type of parent I never want to become.

Peace
