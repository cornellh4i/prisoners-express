**Making Ends Meet by James Bauhaus**

I don’t have to make ends meet. I’m a millionaire by state AND corporate slow death camp standards. I was just begining to work my way up when the cops’ drug-snitch pal tricked them into choosing me to pay for his victim’s murder. I appealed for 13 years before finally proving that the judicial system is completely corrupt, top to bottom. So I escaped their slow-death camp, found the killer for them, then returned to rub the facts into their crooked faces. Meanwhile, I had gotten a big pile of money from working, despite the hardship of having to lie to everyone just to survive. I got two fat corporate pensions that pay me every month now. Also, I invested in the stock market. My blue chips paid off. Well, even after the periodic mega-threats by the biggest crooks on the planet in 2008, 2012, and 2020.

I’ve got more money than I can ever spend on price-gouged prison junk food at $50/week. I’d die of old age before running out of money. But I don;t waste much of my $ on tripled-priced sugar, salt, carbs and fats that they try to sell me. I don’t waste any $ on caffeine, or the nicotine and trash dopes that the prison guard mafia smuggles in for their inmate lackeys.The guard-’carts can’t stand it that I keep almost all of my many thousands of dollars outside, where they can’t get their greedy claws on it. They did get lucky once: the imbeciles at brokerage sent me over $10K to this prison. The dirty shitz here swifty snapped it up, managing to steal it “for me” for over 101 days. Before I could pry it out of their thieving hands, they managed to steal more than $135 in interest while costing me maybe $500 in lost dividends and extra fees.

One thing that offsets their thievery, however, was that the stock that I was trying to buy (AT&T) crashed along with the rest of the market when the SARS Virus arrived from China. (Global Acute Respiratory Syndrome) I was trying to buy it at $38-42/share when it dropped suddenly to $27/share at its lowest. After incredible amounts of bureaucratic bullshit, I was finally able to buy it at $30.61/share. Thanks to GEO prisoncrats stealing my $, and the idiots at computershare refusing to simply take some of my money out of their right pocket and put it in their left pocket, I actually saved $8-12/share!

So! Now I should thank these three groups of people and the credit union I belong to for wasting months of my time to accidentally get me a good deal while they were all raping me as I tried to make ends meet!
