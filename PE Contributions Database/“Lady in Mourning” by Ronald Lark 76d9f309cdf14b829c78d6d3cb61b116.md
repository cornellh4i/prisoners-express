**“Lady in Mourning” by Ronald Lark**

Dressed in black, signifying the mourning of her loss, she thinks back to the beginning, trying to figure out how she got to where her life has led her. Why such a pain has taken seed within.

The home that she was born and raised in, whie isolated from most people and worldly things, was filled with love. Her parents made sure that she wanted for nothing, and that her days were filled with the excitement and security that she needed.

She was a curious girl, always wanting to learn, always finding fascination in everything her attention found itself focused upon. Always wanting to know how things worked, dissecting everything within her mind.

Like when she would come across a flower that grabbed her attention, she would study every aspect of it. How it was put together, the textures, the colors and how they worked together to create such harmony. Her excitement always rose when she found an insect upon it, or flying to it. This allowed her a more complex puzzle… the details of the insect and its strange connection and attraction to such beauty.

Throughout her life she found a constant wave of never ending lessons to be learned. Whatever her situation, within every aspect of life, there was always something to learn. Along every road she travelled, or path she chose to take, she was always looking for the new lesson to learn, no matter the outcome, and with enthusiasm.

Needless to say, she became well travelled, discovering the beauty of the world in all forms that it held, and always meeting new and exciting people along the way.

Though not all of what she learned was pleasant, nor appealing, she was still thankful for the lessons’ guidance, the direction in life that it allowed her. However, not always seeing the good within the lesson learned at the time. Often it wasn’t until she got further down the road, or path, that she was on before she realized the value.

Along the way, she inevitably found that life and people could be cold, with no remorse for what they put a person through. This makes it unbearable for some, while this coldness is contagious to others.

She realized one day that this coldness can seep in and take seed within its victim, when she noticed a bitterness growing within herself, that most people wouldn’t catch. The bitterness attempting to settle in as a coldness toward others, as it had been towards her.

This being just one of the traps, or pitfalls, of life, her determination took hold, to overcome this bitterness, this coldness trying to install itself, and avoid any other possible threats. Thankful that she caught it in time, and for the armor to guard herself from it with, she vowed to always stay alert in the future, ready to defend against such things when they presented themselves. Lesson learned.

From this she found a new awareness, paying even more attention to the world around her, especially its people. She noticed that she wasn’t alone within this endeavor. She could now recognize the look in another’s’ eyes that told her of the struggle within, and whether or not they were succumbing to the constant assault.

At times this was heartbreaking to her, when she saw that someone was losing their battle. Always wanting so much to help, yet not knowing how. Being at a loss…

Dressed in black, she is mourning the loss of many things, from her life, as well as from within others’ lives. Yet, the pain that grips her is for others, for whom a new determination has arisen within her, to help them… her new direction.
