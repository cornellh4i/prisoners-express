****This picture reminds me of the Puerto Rican prostitutes I used to see all the time when growing up in North Philadelphia. They mostly congregated on the corner of Kensington and Allegheny, in front of the El stop. They always fascinated me with their big hair, heavy makeup, short skirts, fishnet stockings, and high heels.

“Who are they?” I’d always ask my mom.

“Working girls,” she’d reply.

Where did they work? I wondered. They certainly didn’t look like any of the girls at my mom’s office. And what kind of work did they do? I never saw them do anything but smoke cigarettes and get in and out of cars.

As I got older and realized who and what they really were, those “working girls” fascinated me even more. I used to love talking and flirting with them, and they responded in kind. I was a typical street punk rocker, wearing torn clothing, leather, chains, and spokes. They loved my brightly colored hair-dos.

Though I never secured their “services,” I did pay them a few bucks to buy me booze when I was a teenager. I’d sit on those pissy El stop steps, drinking and talking to them for hours. Most of them were just trying to make money the best way they could, considering their circumstances. More often than not, they came from broken homes and abusive backgrounds and had addictions and/or kids to support. I could really relate to them and found their lifestyles romantic.

Prostitutes still hold a special place in my heart. I’ve always wanted to write a romance novel about a “hooker with a heart of gold” but hear it’d be too trie. Maybe some day, I’ll find a way to write a story worthy of paying tribute to those “working girls” who fascinated me all those years ago.
