**by Conscious Brother**

In the old days men...women...and children

Were chained...bought...and sold,

Whipped...starved…’till they were old (They were the lucky ones),

After a time some in society felt the injustice done to these,

They suited up, went to war, and fought to

“Give...Us...Free”

Now centuries pass, but alas things remain the same, the plantations are now prisons and the night riders wear badges.

Just like “in the old days” men...women...and children are chained...bought...and sold!
