**“Walking My Track” by James Schmidt**

As I walk alone along the railroad tracks

I step on a rock. It reminds me of my daughter throwing a big rock into a pond.

As I walk down the metal rails it reminds me of my son rollerblading down the street.

With the warm sun on the leaves it reminds me of the warm hugs once given.

As the winds howl through the brush it reminds me of how they used to say *I Love You*.

The train tracks go on for seconds

The train tracks go on for minutes

The train tracks go on for hours

Coming to the fog that would not Vanish, it reminded me of all the love my wife gave me.

The railroad timber under my feet cracked and broken reminds me of the hard times.

Looking over to the other set of tracks, I wonder what my life would be like if I walked them.

The idea, the thoughts come and go as I stay walking my track.

I wonder what or who will be there once the fog clears. Shall it be love, shall it be freedom

I’m full of hope in my heart that on the other side of the fog is my Loving Family and that they walk with me Further on down the tracks...
