American Tradition by Cesar F. Villa

My mother’s father’s name was Aurelio. He was from the indigenous tribe Akimel O’odham (Pima). Her mother, Abigail, was of Spanish descent. In genealogical terms my family’s line is distinct: Mastizo. Anthropologically speaking we descend from the Hohokam Indians. Linguistically speaking, the Uto-Aztecan family. For the culturally challenged… to use layman terms… to the neighborhood kids who (quite frankly) didn’t know better… the sons, daughter, grandchildren were-- how can I put this politely-- bat $#!7 crazy American Aztecs on the loose. So, you could imagine, in this particular household in Redwood City, California a broken English sentence on a Saturday was the best you could hope for.

Once, when I caught my cousin cheating at hide-and-seek, an argument began on our grandparents’ porch. He was adamant that he didn’t have to cheat to beat me. I interpreted this as a gross American affront, pushing him through a plate glass window. Straddling his chest I gave him what for. My grandfather, who’d been watching Big-Time Wrestling, one of his favorite American shows, jumped up from his chair, removed his belt, and went to work on my back, shoulders, waist, and legs. But hardened by American experience (not to mention I was clothed, I continued my work. It wasn’t until he yelled, “Little f---ers,” that I rose stunned. My cousin rose. We couldn’t tell the level of his anger because, well, you know, he had that whole native thing going on. But we both settled on one thing, we heard the f-word clear as day. Anger, frustration, hatred, the f-word, part of the American tradition. We ran back outside to play our American games. My grandfather crossed his arms, which in those days was the second grossest American affront. The first-- sitting cross-legged on the floor, Indian style.
