**“Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapters 7-10” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

**Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 7**

Midget sat on Plymouth Rock, a medium-sized boulder marking the edge of the white’s territory. He was tall at 6’2”, but in a family of giants - even his baby sister, at 16, was 6’5” - he was a “Midget”. ‘Funny how life changes so quick’, thought Midget, reminiscing his recent past.

“Are you freaking for real?!” said Danielle. 

After dragging my attention from a smoking hot chick in a red halter top, skin tight low-rider jeans and five-inch stilettos, I couldn’t muster much in the way of embarrassment. What do you want me to say? I’m a diehard horndog. I didn’t know what to tell Danielle, but I know what I was thinking about. I looked again, for a rear view. I had to. “What a killer body…” Did I happen to mention I had another bad habit? Thinking out loud.

“Oh My God! I can’t believe it, you’re such a jerk!” Yeah, I probably was, but as soon as Danielle stormed, a prefuntionatory slap, of course, I went lowrider hunting…

Midget’s smile wilted around the edges. Now, he had to go on some suicide mission. ‘If I never would’ve chased that skirt’, thought Midget.

“Okay, so, Rafa’s disappeared. Vic’s disappeared and Georgie’s -”

“Desaparecido,” said Manuel, “todos están desaparecidos. Just like -” snap of his fingers “- all three, gone.”

“¡Ay! Qué carajo, we should f- up them morenos. Give ‘em a real good paliza,” said another voice, to which a chorus of consensus followed. Elie and Julio looked at one another. ‘It can’t be helped,’ they thought.

“¿Qué vamos a hacer?” was everybody’s question. If not, it was some variation of that. Eli, Julio, Gabe and Rafael, locked away all day, had been doing just that: figuring out what to do next.

“Mira hombre,” said Julio. “Vive maybe un poco loco pero es mi hermanito. Georgie’s like a brother too, ¡qué va! Even Rafa’s like family now. I can’t, I won’t, just let this go…” Eli, oh-so-reasonable Eli, had committed the last 3 hours of his being dissuading Julio from going all ‘Rambo.’ It didn’t help that Gabe was all for a little blood letting. Rafael was as good as useless. “Si vamos a la guerra, bueno; si no, pues, también esto me cae bien.” War or not, it didn’t matter.

“¿Estás de mi parte o no?” had been Julio’s final question, an ultimatum really. Of course, Eli was with him, they were all they had, nuestra gente. This probably explains why he’d agreed to Big Apple’s assassination, why he was sneaking out to clip the other zones’ wáter lines, why they had lookouts, strapped up for Mongoose, guarding their line; and, most importantly, why Eli’d helped to plan every step of their offensive.

The problem with prison is nothing’s private. Come up on some dope, people somehow find out. Score some porn, liquor, smokes, or whatever, convicts just knew. There’s always a pair of eyes, scoping; a pair of ears, hustling; a set of lips, loosening. There’s never really any secrets in prison. ‘If not for inquisitive minds then, the rumor mill,’ thought Midget, watching the latinos maneuvering with purpose; they’re up to no good. Just like I was with that red halter top…”

“¿Qué chingada! This is almost as bad as the f-ing torture.’ I was gritting my teeth so hard I was sure I’d crack a molar; physical therapy?! ‘Murphy’d done a number on me.’ I can’t walk without help. ¡Cabrón! I can barely piss without falling off the toilet, I thought. I guess I made out alright, though. Only a couple of things broken, a dislocation or two, plenty of son-to-be scars and flesh wounds, and one good-and-well herniated disk; how the f- am I going to get away? What the f- was I-‘

“Well?” asked Murphy from the doorway. His ‘helper’ (read peon) looked up, whites showing all around his irises – fear? He stammered out, maybe a week or two more. Murphy flew into a rage a minute later. Just myself and an unconscious peon. “I know how to escape?” Yeah, worst lie of my life. I closed my eyes. I still had time.

A thrumming silence fell over Lucky Hole. The wind carrying muted, indistinguishable noises. A quiet prison except for a revitalized plink, plink, plink. Midget meandered his way back. Through and past No Man’s Land watching in every direction. He was just entering his home turf. He could relax a bit. That’s when he fell face forward into a puddle of mud.

‘Mud ain’t red,’ though Midget, holding a bloody hand up to his face.

**Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 8**

Murphy turned on the shower. As usual, the water took a couple of moments to warm up. Once nude, he climbed in, enjoying the warmth sliding down his chest, paunch, legs, and jumping off his feet. He smiled. ‘Ahhh… Dad may’ve been a son of a bitch but his ass was right. It’s the small things, the small things that -”

“Huh?!” said Tonka. He tapped the faucet, uncomprehending: “what the f-?”

Abdul and Louie were babysitting for Big Apple. He’d spent a week straight watching Deón. They still had to drug him. At the moment, Deón lay unconscious.

“Can you handle him for a minute?” asked Abdul. Lucky Hole had been extra quiet for the past 36 hours. As quiet as it had been before the last war.

“Yeah, sure,” answered Louie, “bring me back some ‘kay?” A nod then, Abdul closed the door. He sighed, “f-…”

“What do you f-ing mean goddamnit?!” demanded Greed. Tonka wasn’t the sharpest blade in the kitchen. Greed had to be certain. He could be wrong, he could be…

Georgie felt the screams reverberating through his wasted frame. Something about the water? What about it? His mind struggled, bringing his scattered intelligence to bear. What was wrong with the water?

Big Apple lay crumpled at Midget’s feet. He had at least 12 stab wounds Midget could see. There had to be more he thought. There was too much blood for the wounds he could see. Midget turned green. He’d seen death from afar, a lot of violence from up close. Seeing Death in her grand leisure and indolent pleasure, seeing her with no make-up or filter. She was gross, gross and shameless. Worse still, Big Apple hadn’t died yet. ‘Holy mother f-ing Christ!’ thought Midget; I should’ve stuck with Danielle.’

“¿Ya se le acabó?” asked Manuel. Gabe was calmer than usual. Joshua looked as if Santa Muerte had claimed skin and bone and kissed him tenderly. Julio… Julio was changed – Sid Vicious incarnate.

Midget burst in on Tonka and Greed mid-discussion. “Big Apple! They… He’s… I-”

“Can’t you see we’re f-ing busy dips-!?” spat Greed.

Midget sucked in a lungful of air, then rapid fired Green and Tonka. The Latinos were up to no good. What exactly? No clue but definitely bad, nasty even. Big Apple lay dead just inside their zone. Ol’ Georgie had gotten himself nabbed by the S.O.’s…

“…and the water didn’t work,” added Tonka matter-of-factly. Midget experienced a sense of vertigo. Just four years ago he’d been walking with Danielle, as happy as a horndog could get. Then, he’d seen that whore of Babylon in lowrider fashion. Then, Danielle had stormed off. Then, he’d gone chasing lowriders. Then, came two years of chasing heroin highs followed by a pharmacy robbery turned all bad. Then, -

“Hey!” yelled Greed, “What. Did. You. Say?” His eyes narrowed like a hawk sighting prey. Midget gulped, “I, I, I’d said, I mean, the Latinos- ”

“No. No, after that.”

“Big Apple’s dead.” The words sat Louie down. He’d been beaten with baseball bats once. But this felt worse. Abdul had left to find Big Apple and came back black and blue. ‘Well, if he hadn’t been so dark he would’ve been,’ though Louie, bitter irony on his tongue. It’d been more than Abdul’s militancy which had saved him. It had been a fierce fight, he explained. Big must’ve taken most of it out of them. Turns out no good deed goes unpunished. Louie sat desolate, in command.

Rafa wheeled through the library. Quiet, abandoned. Nothing changed since Georgie had gotten kidnapped by Murphy’s gang. Rafa had found both his blades and the book he never went without – Of Love and Shadows, by Isabel Allende – along with Teresa’s photo. ‘Wherever Georgie Boy is at,’ thought Rafa, ‘no está contento.’

With Big Apple dead, water lines severed. Victor still missing, Rafa still awol, nobody knew what had happened to Ol’ Gerogie Boy. Lucky Hole’s inhabitants had had just over a month’s supply of life sustaining water. In a matter of 36-hours, that reservoir was reduced to zero. Zero for everyone except the Raza. Still, the die was cast. The final judgement had begun.

**Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 9**

It’s not often you see a grown man cry, no, openly weep. Rarely ever in prison. Midget had never seen anything like this. There was Greed, literally a mountain of a man, swastika, SS bolts, white power tattoos. More than four notches on his belt. What all good, little prison-bound Aryans aspire to be. There he was, Greed, a pillar of white supremacy. And, he was bawling his eyes out, enraged – over the death of some coon? Tonka wasn’t anywhere close to Hawkins but he knew when a man needed privacy. He did know people. He’d seen the question in Midget’s eyes. He ushered Midget out before the kid could get himself killed.

Sour breath insulted my senses. I opened my eyes, immediately wished I hadn’t. Murphy. His demented mug greeted me, “Well, Georgie Pooh…” his sarcasm was thick, “you’d besta pray to whatever idols you little, brown savages sacrifice to. Because tomorrow, your time’s up. You either get the hell outta here. Or, imma split your ass in two, comprehnday holmes?” Yeah, I got it. Lo comprendo, puto. Only one thought tore through my still addled brain. It sent chills up my spine.

All day after it became common knowledge that the water supply wasn’t limitless. That there was no more water at all. The 300 had a full showing of its talents. Black, whites, boys, Murphy’s numerous peons, and even a few natives all ‘walked the line.’ Desperation drove madness. By sunrise the next day, the smells of copper, cordite, voided bowels and rotting friends soaked heavily throughout Lucky Hole. To some it might seem odd having a burial while so many other corpses littered here and there decomposing. For Louie, Abdul and a few others who could drag themselves from the hopeless abyss, Big Apple’s funeral was an imperative. Even Deón had shaped up for it, still sluggish from the drugs. Louie stood regal, grim, deep in thought. ‘We can annihilate each other or find a way out of this hell hole. Darnell’s death can’t be for nothing. I won’t let it!’

After Marshall Law, the first wars, things had settled. With so much arable land and machinery at their command, what else would you expect red-blooded, good ol’ boys to do? Well, moonshine of course. Idget was drunk, but functioning more or less the same. Lord help him if he could stand without face-planting. Tonka – the loyal enforcer – held his jar, taking small sips, awaiting any attempt. Greed? Well, he was trashed beyond redemption.

“Well,” said Midget thinking, “you know how I came to this here prison?”

“Yeah, yeahs sures…” paused Greed, “didn't cha waste them docs?”

“Yup, at the pharmacy,” replied Greed, “well, there’s a story behind that. And it all starts with that skand Bethany… you recall my old lady Danielle, right? My highschool sweets, bestfriend, tortured martyr in love with a dog? Yeah, so I was curbing my ways, getting serious, trying the whole family thing or whatever. Anywhos, s- was great till I saw her. Dude, she was smoking. Long brown hair, cupid’s bow lips, green-hazel eyes; I mean everything. Sexiest bod… like f- man! Red halter top, dolphin belly button piercing, high heels and those painted on-”

“You know something?” said Greed, “we’re dumbasses.” Then, came a real story.

Sophomore year, Jenna was attending Louisiana State University; Shawnice, Loyola. They shared an apartment close to Loyola in a rough, predominantly black neighborhood. They’d learned long ago racism is colorblind. Whites would hate blacks as quick as browns could hate other browns. What they’d learned freshman year was that the world was full of misogynistic pricks. Darren and Darnell, both highschool freshmen, varsity football players and best friends, were always begging them to come back home. Their sisters always refused. But, they called everyday, no matter what; a hurricane couldn’t change that. Then, they didn’t. One week, then two. Then, a marked police car carrying two giant detectives and a smaller beat cop came. Shawnice had been murdered. How? Gang raped. Jenna had found her. Later, she’d hung herself. Nine black youths from their neighborhood were arrested and later convicted. At trial, it’d come out they’d targeted Shawnice, not for being a lesbian, but for loving a white girl. Their egos could barely stand she didn’t like men. That she didn’t even like black women was too much. They all got 20 years. Darnell became a black revolutionary, a Black Panther…

“…and me, huh… I became a white supremasist and never told my brother how sorry I am,” finished Greed. His eyes closed. He was dead to the world.

**Lucky Hole Chronicles: Chapter 10**

All hell had broken loose. Fools charging the 300 as if they forgot how effective it had always been. A couple of wars broke out. Old treguas – treaties of necessity – collapsed as people saw their last opportunities for revenge sailing away. The blacks went loco. Some came for us, others for the whites. Almost six days of pandemonium. This may sound real heartless, but I couldn’t give a f- less! The more chaos and confusion there seemed to be in each zone, the more Murphy let me be. Sad to say, but the more other people died, the longer my reprieve. I dreamed about that happy brunette; those butter soft, leather seats, that purring, red European beauty, those smooth, levelled roads. Mostly, I dreamed about taking in that lungful or two of clean, crisp air – no thick, sickly sweet, coppery tinge to it, no meaty-ness, no uncleaned tripas. Just that pure air that swirls pale purples and faded ceruleans after a storm shower. Not even my conscience, battered and bruised as it had been, had anything to say. Just, ‘please Dios, please! Don’t stop, don’t let Murphy remember Ol’ Georgie Boy.’

‘What the hell was I thinking?!’ thought Midget as he cleaned out a few new war wounds; dumbass! Could’ve been at home right now, on Danielle’s parents’ couch, eating Little Debbies’ snacks, watching M.I.L.E Juggs 2. But, nooo… you wanted to go lowrider chasing. Stupid skirt! Stupid small head! Stupid heroin! Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!’ They were fighting the blacks, fighting the Latinos, fighting each other, trying to keep the ship from sinking. Greed had gone awol. Tonka too, and about nine other woods. James and Killer Kyle were in charge. That is, until Killer Kyle lived up to his name again. Now, James was dead and the woodpile scattered. Few held the lid. ‘And for what?’ thought Midget, ‘,more permanent tattoos I’ll never be able to tell my grandkids about?’

Julio never moved with more purpose in his life. He was everywhere, a constant intensity, bordering on madness. Nothing like grief to change a man. Or blood lust to drown his guilt. Which is why Julio lost himself to revenge with complete abandon. Big Apple had only been the first in what was becoming a long line of soon-to-be customers of Revenge-R-Us. Julio brooded, ‘they killed Vic. Killed Georgie. Got Rafa. And I let it happen, I failed you Papá. Lo siento mucho pero te he fracasado Papá.’ It drove his insatiable appetite and he impulsed their movement.

“I don’t like this Tonk,” came the careful whisper.

“It don’t matter. Our general says move, you move or… you can join Brain Dead Joey?” answered Tonka, where there had been a growing murmur of consent. After mention of the chopping block, nobody seemed to think otherwise, all six agreed.

Water was scarce. The Raza maintained an ironclad hold over the water lines. Greed had been siphoning and warehousing water from the beginning. So his circle of loyalists had a small, but good supply. Big Apple, Abdul and Louie had started to do the same. Whoever said it was better late than never was right. They had a slim supply – only enough for drinking. Most went without, dying of thirst or suicide. Those who had, hoarded. Those who didn’t often died trying. Outside of the Raza, only Murphy’s zone had a steady water supply. The infirmary had a large tank in the absement where the boilers were. It wasn’t much – only 30 days’ worth – but Murphy was calmer. It also meant I still had time. ‘Thank God for basements full of -’ my mind stopped, like a lightbulb exploding; basements! ¡Pinche sotano!’

Rafa rolled into the housing unit, “Eli! Ey guay, Eli!” Heads turned as they stared at this ghost on wheels. Bodies parted until Rafa came face to face with Julio. Julio blinked, blinked again. “Rafa? I, I thought they killed you too…” ‘Killed me too? Who’s dead? Who killed who?’ ran Rafa’s jumbled thoughts.
