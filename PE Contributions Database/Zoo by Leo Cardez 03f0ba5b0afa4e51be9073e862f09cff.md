**Zoo by Leo Cardez**

3:30 A.M.

My eyes pop open. My internal clock is set around our “feeding” schedule. My stomach churns. I’m hungry, it’s been over fifteen hours since my last meal.

3:45 A.M.

I hear the jingle of the CO’s (correctional officer) keys, the crackle of his radio, chuck holes (feeding ports) opening and closing, and the creaking wheels of the food cart...breakfast is served. I silently pray for a decent breakfast: nope. Two pieces of grey mystery meat, two pieces of stale white bread, and a small carton of skim milk (slightly warm and questionably safe). I hand it to my cellie (cellmate). I’m not THAT hungry yet. I’ve lost 12 pounds in the last week. I can see my ribs.

3:50 A.M.

The CO has returned for the tray. Somehow my celly managed scarf all his food down in less than a couple of minutes. He burps loudly.

*It’s amazing what we’re able to endure when we have no choice. I don't even notice the stench of this place anymore. I’m somehow able to block out the relentless noise and sleep through the blinding, ever present light.*

4:00 A.M.

With nothing else to do, I go back to bed. I ponder if I came to prison as my punishment or for punishment.

7:00 A.M.

It’s Saturday, yard day. Today we got two or three hours outside on a concrete slab. We make sure our cell is in compliance and stand eagerly by the cell door. I;m starting to feel like the family Beagle waiting to be let out.

7:30 A.M.

Still waiting. I’m starting to get nervous. Palms sweating and biting my nails.

8:00 A.M.

We got the bad news. Yard is cancelled – apparently three was a light drizzle. Without a window I have no way to confirm or dispute it. I’m upset, this makes three weeks in a row. I need some fresh air. I need to see the sun. I need out of this 8x10 sinkhole.

8:30 A.M.

I read. I read anything I can get my hands on. I don’t discriminate. I’m not too good for an urban novel and won’t why away from a historical nonfiction text either. I average two hundred pages a day. I don’t know what I would do if I couldn't read. My family sends me books. I request books from various organizations that donate books to prisoners. I trade for books; book for book or sometimes meal tray for book.

*They say there is a prison library book cart, but I think it’s just a jail house myth.

Today I’m reading a George Washington biography. I’m on page 240 of 678, I should be able to finish it by the weekend. Frankly, it’s much more interesting than I thought it would be.*

10:30 A.M.

Cock-in-a-sock (encased sausage) and beans: lunch. I pick through the beans and before eating, last week I chipped my tooth on a pebble.

11:00 A.M.

Workout. Push ups, sit ups, burpees, and squats. I wish I could do more but I’m limited by my tiny cell. Also, our deficient diet isn’t conducive to muscle growth – I tire quickly.

Noon

The nurse is on our desk passing out meds. It seems as if half the prison is on some type of medication. I one considered faking “crazy” in order to get some psych meds that could help me sleep. I still think about it sometimes. My celly is at the door trying to steal a peek. He’s a “gunner” (someone who masturbates when woman walks down the tier). We’ve talked about it. He knows how I feel about it. We look at each other waiting for it to pop off. It’s torture just being in the cell with him.

*He’s a bug (weird, demented, odd, institutionalized). I’m pretty sure he has PTSD. He’s been locked up for over twenty seven years, many of those in max solitary. He gets panic attacks and is paranoid that “they’re listening”. He often talks to himself (and answers himself) and has mentioned suicide more than once. Last week he went to the boom boom room (suicide watch room) where they stripped him down and watched him for three days. He said he spent most of his time masturbating to the nurses coming to check on him.

1:00 P.M.

Cleaning time. I scrub out the toilet to wash my sheets and clothes. I take a thorough bird bath in the sink. I mop the floor and wipe down the walls with a rag. I’ve become OCD since arriving to prison.

1:30 P.M.

The animals are awake. My cell stands on the sink to yell in the vent and talk to his buddies in the cell below us. He send and receives kites (notes) via lines thrown out our chuck holes tangled together with other inmate lines. He knows how to “jail” (used as a verb). He can “pop the cuck” (open our feeding ports from the inside) and knows all the angles to get what he wants.

3:00 P.M.

The neighbor decides to “shut it down” (making so much noise it’s impossible for inmates to talk or hear each other). I’m grateful.

4:00 P.M.

It’s our shower day – once a week for ten minutes. I grab my shower shoes, can’t forget them, last month I found a steaming pile of shit in the shower. The water starts out freezing cold and quickly heats up to scorching hot making it virtually impossible to get all the soap out of my hair and eyes before the CO is back to escort me back to my cell.

4:15 P.M.

I return to my cell to find my celly pasting magazine pages over our overhead light. It’s against regulation and could cost us a ticket, but I understand so I don’t say anything. He’s stuck on the top bunk, just inches from the blaring light and constant buzzing twenty four hours a day.

4:30

Dinner. More cold slop. I check the veggie mix for insects and insect parts. I spill some fruit juice. It quickly stains the cement floor – I wonder what they put into the stuff.

I save some bred in case my pet comes to visit tonight: a baby mouse. I think he’s given up on me. I don’t usually have any food for him. It’s funny I used to have a strong aversion to rodents – prison cured me.

Well, that’s it for food or movement for the day.

6:00 P.M.

I’m tired of reading, but not tired enough to fall asleep. I day dream. I imagine different realities. I’m not in prison. I go back in time and make different choices. In my dreams I still matter.

7:30 P.M.

Mail call. I have nothing to send out, but anxiously await any incoming mail. I love getting mail, but am also anxious about what it might be. I don’t think I can handle any more bad news: a death in my family, a denial of some sort, a confiscation notice.

Nothing. It’s both a relief and a stab in the heart.

I start to obsess about a letter I’m waiting for from my family. Are they mad at me? I rerun every conversation we’ve had and dwell on any slight. I feel abandoned. Buried alive.

10:00 P.M.

My day is over – nothing left to look forward to.

I pray.

I slip off to another dreamless slumber.
