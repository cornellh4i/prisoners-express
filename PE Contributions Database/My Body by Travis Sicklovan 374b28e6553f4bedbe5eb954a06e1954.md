**My Body by Travis Sicklovan**

My body tells many stories. It is a thirty-six year old R-rated canvas that I’m hoping ends in redemption and triumph. As good a place to begin as any other is my tattoos. The oldest reflects a vehement pride for a neighborhood that I’ve terrorized. Another relates my disgust and aversion for those who cooperate with law enforcement. Another still, is a garish celebration of sex and violence by way of a naked woman half wrapped in a bloody sheet, a pistol in each hand and a cigar hanging suggestively from her red lips.

Scars tell stories too; I have scars galore. I have a large one that splits my left eyebrow in half. I like it, it kind of makes me look badass, gives character. I earned it inside a rowdy club in downtown Seattle after being smashed in the head with a bottle without warning. I didn’t fall down but was kicked out of the club. Bleeding badasses don’t exactly get the girls thirsty. I stalked the front of the club for the next hour, trying to convince my friend to give me his gun. He did not and for that I owe him. Two other scars came from being stabbed in the hand and through my left arm. At the hospital my girlfriend made fun of me for the holes in the elastic band of my boxers. I was 17 years old, still trying to show the world how cool and badass I was. Who gives a shit about new boxers? You can’t see them! After healing up I went and shot up the house of the guy who stabbed me. This, I thought, made me cool and tough. The next morning I went to the Bonmarche and stole some new boxers. And a couple Tommy Hilfiger jackets. Hey, it was 1999, give me a break.

My hair has been styled the same since fifth grade; slicked back like DeNiro in Casino or Goodfellas. I idolized real life mobsters and gangsters when I was young. Guys like Carlo Gambino, John Dilinger, Dutch Schultz, John Gotti. Those were men. It didn’t matter to me that most died before their time. I didn’t have a father figure to tell me or show me the absurdity in my affinity for gangsters.

My eyes are green, like the devil’s. (who the fuck found that little factoid out, by the way?) These eyes of mine have seen some serious shit. Some of which was enjoyed. Some regretted. Some justified weakly but thoroughly. A lot of it would make the average man squirm, scream or cry. Soon I’ll be able to see my four year old daughter’s face. That will probably cause me to cry a little bit. I could give a shit if that’s though or cool.

My hands are stained, figuratively, with the blood of other men. These hands have pulled triggers, tied people up, stolen, hit and attacked people. They are the only part of my body that when looked at cause me to feel shame and regret. The good thing is that after prison I can use the same hands to do good things: pick up my daughter, wave someone to go in front of me at the checkout line, plant a tree, or write some words that may reach someone in a way that uplifts them.

My body may not be a temple, but it doesn’t have to be a slum. It’s a work in progress and only, hopefully, halfway to completion. Hopefully you’ll do better than I did, hopefully you won’t take thirty six years to realize that your body is your tool to make our shared world a better place. It’s either that or make it worse, and that story is getting old.
