**“Too Hard.” by Lucas Martinez**

In the beginning, there was one Man and he was born into a hard World. This man, however, did not want to become hardened by the world he inhabited. Over time, the Man and the World came to an end, for every time the World threw its ideals and philosophies at the Man, he did not rebuke them or criticize them, he gave them understanding and took them on with a new outlook.

The World told the Man, “I gave to all those that surround you mind altering substances.” To this, Man says, “Ah, this is nice of you. Many people around me have felt the hardness you’ve shown much more than I have. So an opportunity to relieve this is most gracious,” The World watched this with an analytical eye.

After some time the World told Man, “It is time to introduce violent men into your society. So all those that are still soft will feel their wrath.” The Man looked on at this for a great while then finally replied to the World, “This is a harsh thing you have done. Although, in the end, I believe you have done them a favor. Surely, they would have been crushed by your embrace. Still, even the most violent of men cannot be as hard as the World.” The world heard this with frustration.

Then the World told the man with a smile in his voice, “Okay, would you look on happily if I took your home out from under you?” With that, any time the Man tried to rest his head in an abode it would rudely be ripped away. Then with an even larger smile that had no need to be faked, the Man said, “World, in this you have done your greatest good. I might never had understood the beauty of the night sky and Oh! The people I have met while looking for warmth. I think I may have been incorrect in my assumption of your hardness. Not only will I apologize to you, but from the very bottom of my heart, I thank you.”

The World became outraged and thought of his most devious plot yet, realizing the common thread in the Man’s every defense.

With that, the World surrounded the Man inside a solid stone box and told him, “I have cut you off from everyone you care about. You will never feel love from another again. Soon, all will have forgotten of your very existence.” The Man began frantically trying every method to escape he could conceive to no avail. He then sank to his knees and told the World, “Alas, you are harder than I could have imagined. I have always given and received love, even to you, and that has made my life enjoyable.” The Man began to weep into his hands. The World barely heard the man say, “I will never know joy, I will never again know love. I will become as hard as the World.”

This is how the World and the Man got the best of each other because the World wept as well.
