**“Life’s Purpose” by KC** 

Since February 17, 2013, my purpose is my Husband the Lord Jesus Christ. I am a “blushing bride of Christ”. He is mine, I am His, signed, sealed, delivered. I’m His according to Ephesians 4:30: I surrender all to Him, to my Blessed Savior, my thoughts, my ways, my life, my family, my friends, my dreams, my all according to Corinthians 10:31.

I serve Him by showing Jesus died on the cross to take our sins, crucified, buried; in 3 days he rose again, conquering Satan and death, so I may have eternal life and be with him forever. According to John 3:16: Corinthians 15:55-58; VICTORY IN JESUS.

My purpose is to love and help others out of their despair, old habits, hurts, hang-ups! The Holy Spirit empowers me to keep on keeping on to do HIs High Calling according to Romans 12:9-21, Philipians 3:12-14, Colossians 3:12-17, 2 Corinthians 1:3-7.

Life’s Purpose is to be what our Creator created us, designed us to be-His Children, and to have fellowship with him as he created Adam and Eve to do, before they gave up on God to believe Satan’s lies. Help us, Lord Jesus.

Life’s Purposes is to not desire this earthly life for it is temporary, yet to desire to be a citizen in heaven, rejoicing and being rewarded that we made it, and now live with our Father God eternally. What a day of rejoicing that will be when we see Jesus, we’ll sing and shout the VICTORY.

Philippians 3:20, Revelations Chapter 21-22. Life’s Purposes is to stand on the Word of God Jesus Christ and Believe in our hearts He is Lord Jesus-confesses it ever our mouth. Romans 10:9-10. Let’s Get Busy!
