**“When Life Gives You CHAOS make MUSIC” by Terry Lytle**

1.

(Such as)... I see beauty in the disastrous

Calm in the chaos

I see my shadow family, standing

As waves of an ocean lap at our feet

The smoke-filled horizon, paints the sunset

better than any **Afro-Bob** piece…

And the mountains still overshadow

The lost plains of foliage

Burnt black, like the heart-

The soul, that I am

Being…

Just as one lone tree, standing

Refusing to succumb to the fiery darts

Of Satan…

While a wildfire rages on

Out of control

As my hand - like a hunter, consumes

Firefighters’ lives

Sade, is the truth… as I manage;

Held within,

The picture of a beautiful sunset’s horizon

(OR)

2.

Something…

Like a white snake, escaping bombs and torpedoes

‘Cause I can’t seem to look at you - or look up…

So just, close the door - settle in… (It hurts too much)

The memories ’r’ like, daggers in my back (knockin’ me off track…)

Something like… dancing… with… bombs and torpedoes…

I feel like I’m in the wake of a raid

Where war plane, meets airplane (seems all the same)...

Stranger than this strange land

Is the air I breathe out there: No loud voices,

No banging doors of cells…

There’s… more false lighting than any sunshining

I could ever hope to see out there…

It turns my eyes three different colors

Like torn-up books, with folders for covers -

I can’t tell which is real: prison, breath, or death

With, posted-over walls (and floors painted colors

Of my last cars)

I wonder, at the bars…

Who needs cages, at Central Prison’s Walls?

We’re all just barters - don’t hollar!

At the warehouse doors…

To, bombs and torpedoes

Driving, insane - all!

So where’s your scars…

As C.O.’s escort, wherever we go…

“Remove your hat, sir” - as you come thru

The Door
