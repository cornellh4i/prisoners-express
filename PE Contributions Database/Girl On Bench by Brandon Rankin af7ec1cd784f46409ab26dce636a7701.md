"Girl On Bench" byBrandon Rankin

My “Love, my darling,” I see you shining! “Know you in the wrong, (miss) don’t care,” cause “love is your song… Why,” must I (feel) like I’m breaking the LAW?” I’m in your midst and it’s your beauty that got me feeling, “like I’m breaking the LAW!”.. It’s a true crying-shame, I can’t hold, something like that in my arms…

For the streets and it’s fruit, “I gave up a love,” as sweet, as you. do I hate myself, for doing such a thing, so vain? Best believe “my love, I truly do”... Loyalty you may have but are you my true,” ride or die chick?” We talking bout, “through thick or thin, even when the pressure is so thick, with a razor, could cut it paper thin?”

If only know, I wasn’t a king without a crown! In a concrete jungle, where only the tough guys “rumble,” the “wise” guys get they crown back and the weak and un-hearted step aside, to be soon departed. Just like the “RED-SEA,” when it parted “SHAWTY,” my mystery with you, had yet to get underway. Not that it never can, “my love,” but it never will, my “darling, darling baby.”

Oh, but it’s not me “my love,” it’s yo beauty, that got me going, “GO-RILLA.” I was in my prime, with you my darling. But that young, “knight in shining armor,” your beauty got started!, was wrapped up, in the Ganster-Brawling. So, “I stopped pursuing you,” I even stopped calling…

It’s the type of ending that gets a, “we never broke up, we just stopped talking…” though, I had closed off, our connection, because I knew my “Gangster, Gladiator and Gunstanger,” West TN balling, would wake, the “sleeping Giant,” called “DEATH,” and my end, would no longer be stalling… I do still love you, “baby,” but the judge gave me 40 years at 100% at the age of 17.

I truly loved you more darling and still do, believe me but after a year or 2, you cut me off and now the soul is starving… I cut us off, though “baby,” because I couldn’t entertain the thought of breaking your heart to pieces and thus “dam,” your flow of greatness and ruin your calling. Now I’m going overseas for that “love” you once gave me. A king without a crown, I may be but overseas is and will be my calling. See you in my dreams, my “love,” for my sentence was overturned. -LOL-

Although I wish you got the man, I took a Kodak picture “baby,” oh what’s that.., I was blocking out that image of you dancing. But, all I want to know is, how come every time a prince charming fixing to get out, of this jungle, of concrete, all the ladies start, flocking like they thirsty for a drink of water?
