**“Life Has Purposes” by Brian Lowe**

I am not a believer in that life has a purpose. I believe that Life has multiple purposes. Some are shared by all Life in general, narrowing down all the way to each individual person’s unique and personal purpose.

I’ll briefly expound upon Life’s purpose in general to start. All living beings have the purpose of living, growing, reproducing and dying. Everything that is alive has mastered one of these aspects, thus has served Life’s purpose. In the past was alive, present is alive or dead, future- will be dead.

The next category is also general but more narrowly focused than all Life, is humanity collectively. Humankind has the same purposes as the rest of Life, plus many more based on the special position they hold-that of being the only known intelligent being anywhere. In truth, many of these purposes are also great responsibilities. Some of the purposes in this category are simple, like long term planning, and others are so complex that only our entire accumulated pool of knowledge allows us to even guess they exist. Use your head and think about humanity’s role in Life and you will get a peek at the tip of the iceberg.

Now, to the Life’s purpose that most people focus on: Their individual sense of purpose and meaning in Life, what makes Life worth living. Remember this, if you don’t have a purpose in life, you are just an actor, never a director. You must find your own purpose, here is how to get started:

First, you must know yourself, inside and out, before you can begin to identify your purpose. Second, once you have a hint of your purpose, you must formulate a plan to guide you to it. Third, do not be afraid to revise your plan. Things change. You cannot see the future, stuff happens. You can either work around it towards your purpose or you can surrender and lose your purpose. Lastly, be true to yourself and your purpose.

There are many gradations and degrees of Life’s Purpose, the key being to remember you are unique and what works for one may not work for another. So if something does not work for you, don’t let it discourage you from your purpose, and try something else.
