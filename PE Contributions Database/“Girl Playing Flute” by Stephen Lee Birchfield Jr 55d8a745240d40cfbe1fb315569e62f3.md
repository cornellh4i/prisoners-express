**“Girl Playing Flute” by Stephen Lee Birchfield Jr.**

I hate my parents for making me pose for this atrocity of a photograph. My folks were a bunch of hippie idiots. Were they trying to prepare their daughter to be the chief fellatrix of a porn company? Come on! What were mom and dad thinking? Or were they? Thinking, I mean. What is it with white people trying to be Indians? Is this a form of Stockholm Syndrome in reverse? Mother is vegan and daddy dearest is meat free. They argued over eggs and milk. Yet, here they have me draped in fox animal skin and decked out with chicken feathers. Does hypocrisy ring any bells at all? It is just typical of the sort. Daddy drove 30 miles out in the country to “find the perfect spot” for this-dare I say-photo op.

Here we are in the middle of nowhere in late fall. Judging from my parents’ decision making abilities pot should not be legalized...ever. Our little Boston Terrier, Stripe, was bouncing all over the place and bounded away as soon as the Maverick’s door was opened. We followed Stripe’s lead to a little tree filled dell. It was idyllic as I recall. Dad got his photograph for some tree hugging group while mom smoked dope. My parents were so anti-establishment that they refused to watch T. V. or listen to the radio. We had no clue that the season’s first winter storm was about to be a blizzard. It was snowing so hard by the time we got back to the maverick the visibility was almost nil. Mother-bless her heart-left the key to the car in the “on” position. The battery was dead and Maverick was pointed uphill. There was no push starting him.

In the car we sit freezing, watching the snow pile up around everything but especially around the car. Even Stripe wants in the modicum of warmth the car provides. Daddy gets the brilliant idea to build a fire, but there is already 2 feet of snow on the ground. He lights a fire in the overflowing ashtray, but soon runs out of fuel. Soon it is dark and unbearably gellid. We are all going into hypothermia, and are starving. Or, at least very hungry. The snow saved us. The maverick became our igloo. The question of food is very prominent in our minds.

Two days have gone by. Daddy tried to eat Stripe’s dookie and threw up for his trouble. The car smells horrible. Stripe hiked his leg and pee-peed on Momma. Never have I seen her so mad. She killed Stripe with the tire tool. Daddy looked like a ghost, but we now have a nice juicy Stripe to eat. Mother the vegan ate the lion’s share. She even knew how to some what dress poor ole Stripe out. To this day I can not eat a raspberry snow cone. Over the next 3 days we ate Stripe. I shit out a hairball so big I had to go to the hospital. We were finally found by an elk hunter who had killed a huge elk. Mother and daddy immediately began ragging the dude about it, with Stripe’s blood on their faces.

The End
