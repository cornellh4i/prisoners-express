**“More Than A Look” by Robert Johan Richter**

When is a look just a look? Never, as far as your woman is concerned. She is biologically programmed to be hypervigilant for any sign of defection. She cannot ignore anything that signals the tiniest possibility that you will run off with another woman, leaving her to raise your child (or children) by herself.

“But we don’t *have* a child!” you cry, “She isn’t even pregnant! *And* we use protection!” So what? Her hindbrain doesn’t know this, her instincts are not affected in the slightest by what she “knows.” Knowledge can’t counteract feelings that are wired into her brain. Birth control has no effect on her feelings. People have sex because it feels good, and it feels good because sex makes more people.

Maybe, just maybe, you can play the “make me want you” game, at least once in a while. Women are naturally insecure, in a way men can never feel or understand. Play that game too often, or in the wrong way, and it’s GAME OVER! You have to know the rules, and obey them, and few people do.

Rule one is *Don’t Get Caught*. That’s it. Men look, men cheat, and women know this. As long as your woman knows, beyond any doubt, that you won’t leave her, she’ll tolerate anything. Nobody taught her to feel this way, and she doesn’t know why she does. It’s instinct.
