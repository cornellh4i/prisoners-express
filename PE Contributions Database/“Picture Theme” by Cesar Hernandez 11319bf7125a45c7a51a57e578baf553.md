**“Picture Theme” by Cesar Hernandez**

Reliable people don’t make promises easily, but once they do, they keep them. One promise is worth a thousand pounds of gold.

There lived a man named Bob who attached great importance to promises. Once he promised something, he would do everything he could to fulfill it, no matter how difficult it was. When Bob was educating his children, he was as strict with himself as he was with them. Once, his wife was planning to go to the fair, and their daughter started crying to persuade her to take her with her. She didn’t want to bring her and said, “You stay home and play as much as you like. When I get back, I will kill a pig and cook it for you.” Hearing this, the daughter was delighted and stopped crying. She only said this to fool her and soon forgot about it. However, Bob went ahead and killed a pig for her.

After returning from the fair and discovering what had happened, Bob’s wife became angry and said, “I only said that because I couldn’t think of another way to put her off. How could you take it literally?”

Bob replied, “Children shouldn’t be tricked. She will only imitate us. Fooling her today is teaching her to lie in the future.” As parents, you must keep In mind the long-term effects of your child-rearing choices. If you lie to your children, they will learn that it is acceptable to lie, no matter what you teach them with your words. Any appearance is illusory.

If you understand this, it really helps to lessen your suffering. If you think when encountering frustration or unhappiness,

“All this is the work of mind. Without attachment it would not be like this,” then what is at first unbearable can become magnificent.
