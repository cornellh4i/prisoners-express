**“Buddy” by Brian Lowe**

It was almost time. Buddy’s original owner was coming to take him back home. Deb and I would miss him terribly. It turns out that Buddy belongs to a little girl named Molly, who lives a couple of towns over. One day, last summer, he wandered off from his yard and ended up here on our porch, starved of both food and affection. I am not sure how he made it this far. I thank God that he did. For you see, Buddy is a miracle worker. He may not be able to talk, yet he makes up for it with his loving nature. Part of the miracle is his personality, even after all he has been through. One of his hind legs is missing. It appears to be bitten off by a huge animal such as a shark. The nearest ocean is a thousand miles away. Only the poor guy knows what really happened. Buddy is also deathly afraid of children. He cannot even watch a television show with them on it without shivering uncontrollably and peeing himself. Poor guy just goes into fits! Strange that his owner is a child. I wonder how he is going to react when Molly and Mark, her dad, show up. I almost hope that Molly rejects him. Then he doesn’t have to leave, he can stay here. Wishful thinking.

I just got off the phone with Mark. He needed directions again. We live out in the sticks, with the nearest neighbors several miles away. There aren’t any street signs on the dirt roads, only local landmarks to go by. Turn right at the tree next to the cow pasture with the green gate. That kind of stuff is normal here. I am tempted to lead them astray. More time with Buddy. I mean Shiloh, his Molly-given name from before. I am truly dreading his departure. Deb has already locked herself in the bathroom, sobbing. I don’t know what to do.

I wonder why Buddy won’t answer to Shiloh. When he was found, he was not wearing do tags, or even a collar. Not even one of those chip things. We took him to the vet to check! If I didn’t put that “found dog” article in the paper, Buddy could have stayed. I wanted to find the poor guy’s family, but somewhere in the wait he joined ours. Wait a second, Buddy doesn’t answer or respond in any way to Shiloh! Maybe there is a mix up and he is not Molly’s dog! Or worse, Buddy escaped from them, just look at his leg and how he responds to children! What if they are just trying to steal Buddy? I won’t let that happen. If Buddy reacts badly to their appearance, then I’ll know for sure.

I am ready. Machete behind the porch swing, wedged in the back of the seat out of view. Hatchet in the flower pot, hidden but easily accessible. I don’t have to worry about any neighbors, one of the many benefits of living in the countryside. Should I tell Deb? Would she understand? No, she’s not ready yet. Maybe never. I have to do this alone. She must never find out. What she doesn’t know won’t hurt her. And we’ll have Buddy!

They’re here. I walk Buddy out to the drive to meet them. Joyous reunion. I’m devastated, heart-sick. I can still turn this around. Lure them to the porch. I can claim they never showed up. It will be simple. But, no, I can’t do that to Buddy, I mean Shiloh. He is happy with her. Molly is young and has her whole life before her, with Shiloh. I am just an old man, with an old wife, whose life has passed by.

I can still hear Deb crying behind the bedroom door. Machete in one hand, hatchet in the other, I  rap on the bedroom door. Teary-eyed, Deb opens the door. I end her tears. This is a finality that finishes all her pain. I arrange her on the bed and leave for the garage. Through my own tears I finally find the gas can and return to our bedroom. I douse Deb and the bed first, then the rest of the room. Then I crawl into bed and hold her one last time. Now I light a match. We were old, now there is nothing left. Together in nothingness.

At an intersection, down the road from the burning house, an excited Shiloh is jumping around the car, Molly laughing and giggling at his antics. Then Shiloh falls between Mark’s legs, accidentally hitting the gas pedal. The car surges through the crossroads into the path of an eighteen wheeler. The tractor-trailer rig plows through the car. Mark, Molly and the other driver are killed almost instantly. There is no other traffic, no one to render aid.

A three-legged dog, with a soulful look on his canine face, crawls from the wreckage. On to the next mission.
