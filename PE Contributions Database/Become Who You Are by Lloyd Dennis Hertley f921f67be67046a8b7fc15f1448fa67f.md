"Become Who You Are" by Lloyd Dennis Hertley

In 1992, I attended my first outdoor concert from “the cheap seats” to impress a hippie. Janie was one of those early nineties girls who wore the clothes that my parents donned in the late sixties. Tho decades now separate Janie and I, but I recently heard an old Buffalo Springfield song that tied those two eras under a simple snapshot.

“Tin soldiers and Nixon’s coming. We’re finally on our own,” Neil Young snarled after four students were slain by police during the Kent State massacres. I saw a TIME magazine photo just the other day of students reading lazily under the canopy of trees on campus only hours before the protests.

In the early seventies, my parents tried to explain the feelings that could turn a peace dog into an anarchist. We were listening to Stevie Wonder, and I couldn’t have wrapped the flag any tighter, despite my protests festering inside. Vietnam… Nixon… adolescence. I was pissed. As my dad passed the bong, I was already seeking higher ground.

Twenty years later, I’d spent thousands of dollars on music, attending concerts from gold circle seats just for the show onstage. I would sometimes look back at the party people throwing frisbees from lawn chairs and think, “They don’t know what they’re missing up here.” Still, I couldn't find release in the music. What were those students listening to at Kent State?

Lollapalooza was the signature event of 1992 on my concert calendar. Janie was the silver-spoon fed teenager whom I’d coveted since she came to work at my Little Caesar’s. Blind Melon, 311, straight long hair, no makeup, about to leave for Chapel Hill in the fall...that kind of girl.

She wanted lawn seats. Of course.

They were the hardest set of words I’d ever had to say at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning, “Two lawn seats,” I protested. The Ticketmaster ticket mistress looked puzzled. She knew that I always camped at her door for front row seats. Janie tugged at my sleeve, signaling a trip down the used CD aisle for another “jam band” disc to torture me on the long ride home.

I never kissed Janie. I never held her hand. At 29, I just wanted to feel the things that she expressed so well. If love came, UNC would take it away. So I chose the innocence of roaming with Janie that summer.

I met my brother at Lollapalooza. He had won cheap seats, so we both longingly admired how high the stone wall loomed that separated us from The Ministry banging out industrial metal only twenty rows beyond. When I went back to find Janie, I almost tripped over her outstretched hand. I looked back and froze in the heart-catching tangles of her breeze-blown hair. She posed on elbows, an open book by her side. Who reads when The Ministry is on? Suddenly, I got it. As I looked around me, the autumn air whispered change while it did those magical things to my summer muse. Janie smiled her pseudo-hippie happy smile and danced while lying still. An illicit puff (or ten) later, I started to panic. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming! It was dark! People were gathering blankets in a pile! Fire!

I’d only danced once in my life, at the ill-fated wedding that I’d stumbled into with wife number one. I saw my brother spinning near the growing pyre. The band was playing “Give it Away,” and I ran into the melee. Lost in a sea of synchronized struts and flailing arms, I danced around the fire. We pushed and shoved. It was the end of communication… the birth of the internet. No one held up phones for a memory. Maybe we were just protesting the impending implosion of Kurt Cobain, but it felt like war to me.

The Chilis ripped into “Higher Ground,” and I thought about my dad explaining Kent State while Stevie played. Those “in the know” know that Anthony Kleidis spews the words until the band breaks into mosh-pit punk at its finest.

On that bridge stands Janie.

Janie is moving, but in a snapshot memory she forever stands still. Suddenly, she is an aggressive blur, charging towards me with that book outstretched towards our blaze. I know that it was only a few seconds, but at the cusp of everything it is forever. Janie hurls the book at something burning between us. She looks up in rage and almost flattens me with a thrown shoulder. It was more intimate than sex I’d imagined. It was deeper than love.

There were other songs, and yeah, we laughed a few more times after the fire that we shared had burned away. On the long ride home, we discovered the latest Juliana Hatfield CD together. It was called Become Who You Are, but when I checked it was almost midnight.

Janie left for college the next day. I haven’t spoken to her since.

Maybe that is what I was protesting. Maybe it was the change we both sensed that would lead Janie to Carolina blue, and me to the woman at Circle K who would become my wife only months later. Her name was Jeanie, an aberration of only one letter from perfection. On the lawn that September, we all stood at the brink of technology, but my next decade would only bring simple things, like the leukemia to a daughter that I hardly knew. It would bring another divorce and a son who was never really mine. It would bring the sudden death of a parent and close in prison at 39. I wonder what became of Janie.

This year, Lollapalooza will be streamed live and even available on TV. Thousands of people will scramble through Grant Park in Chicago, iPhones searching like periscopes for what my eyes saw in 1992. There will be no fire, only the lighter flame apps on books too expensive to toss in protest. Individually, social media will vent the rage that I felt until some kid buys a gun. I guess Janie would know better than I do, a dozen years removed from her world. I wish that I knew why she threw her book, or even what it was. The truth, however, is a feeble thing. It resides in the tone of my daughter, now 26 and cancer-free.

She packs her blanket and a book to see Lana Del Ray on her “Ultraviolence” tour, and Tara will lie on that same lawn where Janie and I burned so brightly in 1992.

I hope that Tara bumps into Janie there, too.
