Big City by Joshua S. Balistreri

I grew up in the city. As a child I never noticed the hardships, and toil that makes urban living so very hard. I suppose that is because my parents did their jobs well. They made sure I didn’t have to see the darker side of the city until it was right for me to. For that I am grateful.

As I grew older my experiences grew with me. My view and perceptions broadened. The more freedom I had the more I discovered how things really worked. I began to see how some had to struggle just to survive, and how others, no matter how hard they struggled were unable to do even that.

Oh, how grateful was I of my upbringing.

Then, when I was in my early teens, I began going to my aunt’s cattle ranch in Oklahoma for the summers. This was as far removed from the city as I’d ever been. It was like nothing I had experienced. The air was fresh, and the water clean. It was a new world to me.

My cousins and I were put to work around the property, as is everyone on a ranch, and of course as an adolescent I resented this. We would paint fences, drive cattle from one pasture to another, and I even learned to drive a tractor, and operate a combine for plowing the fields, and baling hay. It was incredibly hard work.

However, when the work was done, we were free to do as we pleased. I learned how to ride horses. How to hunt proficiently with a bow, and how relaxing it could be fishing for bass in the early hours of the summer mornings. And of course there were the nights we’d spend camping in the woods.

And though in these times when I was away from the city, even as I was having such a wonderful time, I’d find myself homesick. Missing the city.

The time I spent in the country, no doubt, was good for me. I would come home tanned, and my body was firm, and supple, and toned. Yet no matter how much I enjoyed my summers away, I would always be glad to be back. Back in the hustle of the city. For all of its faults, and complexities, the big city is where I am from. It is and always will be my home.
