**Protected by Keith Costa**

Is the idea of being protected anything but a naive illusion? Were the victims of my crimes protected? Are prisoners protected from inhumane guards? Are innocent people protected from contracting horrible diseases? Are we protected from ourselves?

Maybe being protected is a warm and fuzzy idea born out of convenience.

Ultimately, all you can ever do is be prepared. Be prepared for the moment when the “protected” ceases to protect.

If I come off as cynical, it’s due to a life of witnessing the lack of protection.
