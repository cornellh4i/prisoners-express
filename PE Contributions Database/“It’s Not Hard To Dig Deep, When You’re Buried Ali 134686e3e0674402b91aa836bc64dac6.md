**“It’s Not Hard To Dig Deep, When You’re Buried Alive” by Nate A. Lindell**

When I read Nabakov’s son’s translation of his father’s tales, I wondered where he got inspiration for his mostly sweet, hopeful stories. When I read Kafka’s entirely dark, despairing tales, I wondered if I was him in a past life… not that I’d want to be (I’d rather have been a corrupt politician, reincarnated as who I am as punishment…).

For the last 22 years I’ve been in a desperate struggle to stay alive, to develop/improve myself, to connect with other humans trying to be; a sophisticated organization has hired delusional hypocrites to cut down my beanstalk, every time it’s about to blossom, each time concocting a different excuse for doing so than the last excuse, while swearing, “It’s not that we have a problem with you having a beanstalk” (I guess it’s just me having a magical beanstalk…).

Having a mom who, when I was a child, expressed her love in various painful, sometimes near fatal ways; being raised in a Church that let priests molest kids, while preaching about heaven and their God’s love helped stretch my imagination and normalize the bizarre for me.

So, I’ve come up with dark, surreal tales like, “The Boy With Onion Skin Eyes”, which is my effort to let others out their “like me” know that they aren’t alone. Such others are my true inspiration, because they are me: you could fairly say that my writings are selfish scribblings to myself, ultimately written to myself. But they really are more; they are part of my struggle to enlighten those who are ignorant or narcissistic rip the skin off of our onion-skin eyes.

The eye-peelers, who curiously prosper and remain oblivious/indifferent to the pain that they cause/permit/project on others, can’t be directly enlightened; they may not be enlightened at all, at least not humanely. But tales like “The Boy With Onionskin Eyes” may do so, … if they make the mistake of trying to understand what I’m saying.

My advice to those who think that their thoughts are too bizarre, their stories too disjointed, too abstract, is … they may be! But your story may let someone else know that they aren’t alone. It may - like a butterfly … or a bat :) - flitter on down and land in someone’s soul, letting them know they aren’t alone.

Solidarity.
