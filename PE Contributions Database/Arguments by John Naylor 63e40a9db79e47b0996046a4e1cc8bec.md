**Arguments by John Naylor**

Growing up it seemed I was never too far from someone arguing. Conservatives are passionate as any liberal ever thought to be. And sometimes part of what each side is saying is partly right. Though I think it’s rare that it’s more accurate to say any candidate was completely right on all issues. I enjoy conversation, going down memory lane at times too. I detest arguing. Though debating can be interesting. Exciting even.

Looking back on my passionate stance against arguing I thought of what I read long ago. No it wasn’t an excerpt from the Bible. It said the whole purpose of arguing is to try to get the other opposing side to see your point. Though I think in the heat of the moment it’s more than that. In the heat of the moment, in the passion you want them to admit they’re wrong! And maybe even wrong, and stupid, just plain dumb for standing so firmly on being wrong and stupid.

I suppose it’s ironic though. Someone as opposed to arguing as myself sits in prison reading law books, case laws and often building arguments. I suppose the contrast is it’s more like collected calm debating. And with the law on your side, you’re never suppose to look wrong and stupid. Sadly this fear of failure defers men until they can’t grow or fight for justice. So I pray you pour all of the passion and anger. I often hear courtside and on the cellblock into productive arguments. And as for me I won’t be a hypocrite. I may be off into magazines, GTL music and cable tv the rest of the evening. But tomorrow it’s back to arguments. I wish you Godspeed!
