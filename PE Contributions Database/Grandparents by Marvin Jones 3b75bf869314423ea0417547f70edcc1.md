**by Marvin Jones**

****In 1997, I was locked up in Boston, Massachusetts, doing 8 to 9 years. It was to be my last time being incarcerated, where I had a daily routine of weight room training and boxing ring sessions. I became somewhat of a legend in the penal system. I began to believe all the hype myself; I felt as if nothing could weaken me or harm me. I went from 190 pounds up to 289 pounds of solid muscle during those years. My fighting skills increased almost as much as my muscle gain. I feared no one, nothing. But I didn’t know God, and that’s where the chink was in my armor. He has a way of weakening the strongest of the strong, and He got to me through my grandmother.

One day, while sitting in my cell, an officer came and told me my counselor wanted to see me. The only time they want to see you is when it’s time to sign your release papers (but I had 3 or 4 more years to go) or to give you bad news, so I slowly walked to his office wondering what’s going on. Did something happen to my kids or wife or mother? Once I got there, he made me sit outside his office for 20 more minutes, so I decided to leave: he can keep his bad news, I thought.

Just as I reached for the outer door to leave, he calls me into his office (crap!!). After I take a seat, he says, “Marvin, I’m sorry, but I have some bad news.” (Wow, I’m so surprised!) “Your grandmother died yesterday.” I thought, did he say my grandmother? The woman who loved me more than I loved myself? The woman who thought I could do no wrong in her loving eyes? The woman who devoted her life to God? That’s impossible, I thought. She can’t die. God wouldn’t do that to me.

I don’t know how or when I made it back to my cell, but for the first time in 20 years, I cried. I cried like a baby. People who heard me were scared to tease me or even come to see what was wrong. I grieved like that for 3 days. I talked to my grandmother’s spirit as though she were there with me! Nothing can replace your grandparents. For those of you blessed enough to still have them in your life, cherish them and the love and knowledge they have to give.
