On top of the mountains surrounding the city are centers sending the controlling waves that echo through my mind every waking minute. The television, phone, and other electronics amplify the signals, making escaping them all but impossible. I am trapped.

I don’t remember if there was ever a time without the voices. It is like my mind is tied to another mind, and the thoughts get sent through tendrils inside my head. These “other” thoughts are not mine. They are trespassing, and sometimes, it makes me want to leave this place for good, just to have a little peace and quiet.

I grew used to the looks people give me, as if I have another person growing out of my head or something. Don’t think I am so stupid that I can’t see that you don’t believe a word I am saying. I know you think I am crazy.

I’ve been on the medicine before. It saps my life energy and leaves only an empty shell of who I am. True, the voices leave me then, but along with the very soul of who I am.

So my sister mind and I are going to sit here awhile near this high, open window and make ourselves some hard but necessary decisions. Whatever happens will be the right choice for *both* of us.
