**An Island Vacation by Myron Martens**

It was a hot summer day when we packed the truck with about three weeks worth of clothes, food and other supplies for the both of us. I had also packed the cooler with ice and drinks. I checked the tires along with the oil and we were off to our vacation destination.

With an uneventful safe trip, we arrived at Southport about four hours later to catch a ferry to the island just in the nick of time-- close call #1. I quickly grabbed our luggage and hauled it over to the dock where an enthusiastic attendant took over after checking out tickets and reservations. Had we arrived five minutes later, surely we would have missed the ride.

Within minutes we had found our seats on the ship and I caught myself admiring her beauty. With her long, brown, curly hair blowing around in the wind, the beautiful backdrop of the white waves off the vast Atlantic Ocean and the partly cloudy bright blue sky, it was absolutely gorgeous as we made our way to approach the island.

That moment was short lived, however, since we docked on the Bald Head Island just twenty minutes later. We then boarded a tram which promptly took us to the beach front house we had rented for the week. It was an awesome beach house too! The dwellers even left us a housewarming gift-- champagne and a party platter. She didn’t like the intoxicant, so I drank the entire bottle. We shared the complimentary snacks.

There were no cars allowed on the island, only a few maintenance vehicles. In the garage sat two golf carts plugged into an electric outlet. I must admit, I was eager to take one for a spin around the lovely island. Since I am an adventurer and golf carts were the only means of transportation, I would get plenty of opportunities to explore in one.

I drove all over and around that island in that week, even went places where there were no roads. One time we stayed out a bit too late. As the sun set, it got real dark out there on those winding narrow roads. With no headlights and a light drizzle in the dark, it felt like we were in a rainforest or something. It was great! It was almost as if more wildlife came out after the sun and set on the island. As I struggled to see the road that led to our return that night, a raccoon ran out in front of us. That was close call #2-- I almost ran over a raccoon. But somehow we made it.

We did a lot of sightseeing on the island that week. We visited a museum, hiked a lot of trails, climbed Old Baldy-- their lighthouse. We even saw a family of alligators up close. I almost got bit by one! That was close call #3. Nah just kidding, but there is another close call coming up, I promise.

On the last day of our island vacation we had rented a kayak to tour around in on the water, she hated the marsh. I guess we had stayed out there far too long because she got sunburned pretty bad. Her pale, bright, fair skin always just seemed to turn pink under the sun. I even gave her my T-shirt to cover her badly burned legs with. The sun didn’t burn me so much, but I had to take her to the hospital to treat her 2nd degree burns after we got back.

It was there on Bald Head Island, that week in 2008, that I had decided, I knew I wanted to marry that girl. Shortly thereafter, I bought her a princess cut diamond ring. While she did say yes and I believed her, I now realize that I had made some unfortunate decisions that would eventually tear us apart. Close call #3 (as promised) I almost got married to my Jenny.
