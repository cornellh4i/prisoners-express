**“Shackles of Shame” by Jeff Wager**

Our parents left our faces shamed, left us chained to godless leanings. They taught us to focus on differences, to point fingers at others, and to cast blame. They taught us to follow a spirit of divide (a devil spirit): us against them, color vs color, science vs religion. They taught us to separate God from all things, to not pray, and to not pledge an allegiance to a nation “under God.” Rebel, rebel, rebel. Our parents have not taught us well.

Our parents have allowed strangers to come in, strangers who demand that god never came in the flesh. They teach us to show honor, respect, and allegiance to gods of our own desires, lifeless gods. “To each their own,” “every person for one’s own self,” “ Everyone has a ‘right’ to their own opinion.” Really?! Does anyone have a “right” to any opinion that disputes God?

Is it possible that people confuse the “freedom” to choose god (or not) with the “right” to do so? Freedom of choice allows for individual consequences. On the other hand, if we have the “right” then we can’t be judged, not even by God (It’s our right). O why! O why did our parents teach us that lie?!

We do have the freedom to choose whether or not to believe in God. We do have the freedom to choose whether or not to repent from what he stipulates sin to be. We do NOT have the “right” to set ourselves up to be to only “god” to be served. We have the “freedom” to make that choice; but why didn’t our parents teach us that? The only thing we have “earned” or have by “right” is death. It is God who has freely gifted us with the “freedom” to choose life instead of that death. He came in the flesh and died the death we owe. Of course, all religions do not teach this as truth; but why would our parents not teach us this one? Why would they teach us to ignore or to remove God who gives us this freedom to choose?

We like the idea of being able to choose for ourselves. We are thankful for the “freedom” to do so. We wish our parents would have taught us the truth about Jesus. We are just little kids. We were taught to hide our shame, to not let anyone see who we really are. We are shackled, chained to godless leanings screaming, “It’s our right!” This is the result of what our parents taught us. We were taught to “be whatever you want to be,” and “do whatever you want to do;” but why didn’t they teach us to be who God wants us to be, and to do what God wants us to do? Why did they teach us we could live in harmony, right now, with all people (as one people in our own country) as “one nation under God”? Why didn’t they just tell us the truth about God’s gift of freedom from the bondage of sin so that we could choose for ourselves-life or death? Can we make that choice now?
