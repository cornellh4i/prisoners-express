**"Practical Joke" by Colin VanBilliard**

One of the funniest jokes is when someone fell asleep with his feet were hanging out the bars, and I put matches between his toes and lit them on fire.

Another time, someone wrote this guy’s number on some homo stuff just to see what he would do. We were standing in front of his cell, and he started blowing everything out of his cell. I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.

Also, I sent this girl candy, a card, and a photo of a puppy and asked her if she loved me. Kept doing this for like a month until she said I got this crazy sending her this stuff. I’m standing there trying not to laugh.

Another time, my boy said he needs a female, and so I had my girl prank talk to him. They arranged to see each other at Mickey D’s: she was going to be in the booth. I bought a blow up doll, dressed it, set it up in the booth and sat on the other side. Then the fireworks jumped off, we had speakerphone in the pocket of the blow up doll. He didn’t notice that he was talking to my girl. Then he noticed and ran over and wanted to fight. This was the best. Then when my boy was drunk and passed out in the chair, we put empty beer cans on his shoulders and cigarettes in his mouth then took photos. We were dying of laughter!
