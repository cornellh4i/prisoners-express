"**A Time of Danger" by Corey Higgins**

****A family stands in muddy water in an embankment waiting, holding each breath in trying their best not to make an inch of a sound. The older women of age around seventy seem to lean over on the embankment feeling the hand of her youngest daughter holding her up. A baby halfway in the water wondering why his Mother has him in the muddy water, the baby looks around with amazement but still silent. Two sisters, one holding her Mother up and thinking when will it be over, the other holds on to her baby waiting and praying all is silent enough to get them to leave.

They can hear the voices of the soldiers yelling and calling commands, the little but comfortable hut being thrown into bits and pieces. Only given a second of thinking about their personal belongings being torn to shit, then the youngest sister gives up on the thought, and starts to ask herself “How long can Mother stay in this muddy water”. The little baby lets out a sigh to say his amazement has come to an end and both sisters give a worried look.

Then a snap of a branch breaks and footsteps come closer along with yelling. Right on cue, the oldest sister puts her free hand over the baby’s mouth keeping silent as they could, a few more footsteps but soon a pissed-off Chinese soldier starts breaking orders and the footsteps soon leave off in the distance.

Soon after they left and no sounds were near the oldest daughter let out a cry, and jumps up out of the embankment realizing that her baby was not breathing. She cries trying to breathe into her baby’s mouth as she thinks she has killed her baby, the youngest sister jumps out letting her mother lay on the side of the embankment. She pushes her sister out of the way giving small breaths into the baby’s lungs and little pushes on the chest.

No sooner as the baby lets out a loud cry and tears start to come out not just the revived baby, but both sisters cry for the little wet clothed now breathed life once more. As they sat in the mud holding and crying the little baby they finally thought the worst part was over, but as they got up to get their sick mother. But soon they would know that right when their baby breathed life again, their mother took her last one.

For this is just a small story in time of danger of a time of war.
