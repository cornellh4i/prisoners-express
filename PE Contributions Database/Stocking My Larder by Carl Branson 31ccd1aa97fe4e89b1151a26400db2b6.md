This month’s theme of fill in the blank made it difficult to come up with a unique or clever title - particularly when the first thoughts on the topic resulted in: when life gives you manure make fertilizer. No doubt the first question in every reader’s mind is: where did that come from? This essay answers this question.

Although I was city born and bred, mom always had both flower and vegetable gardens gracing the family property. Therefore, when I had my own apartment in a Western suburb of Chicago, having gardens was a foregone conclusion.

Ok, gardening might not be viewed as a “macho” topic, but that is a myth in my mind - just look at who is behind the plow in most of those old westerns and who is typically driving the John Deeres today; so, gardening is just farming on a smaller scale.

One day at lunch by pure happenstance conversation initiated by co-workers (all men) turned to the upcoming gardening season. The information I gained from that discussion resulted in two valuable components: 1 - there was a local men’s gardening club (which I immediately joined), and 2 - that one of the largest mushroom growing facilities in the country was only a few miles from my house. The second bit is the source of this essay.

Certainly, everyone has either heard or used the retort: “I’m the resident mushroom, they keep me in the dark and feed me bullshit.” Well, that is only partially true in a commercial growing facility, or so I learned.

In the commercial environment, fresh cattle manure is blended with hay and/or straw before being spread into “growth frames.” This blend goes through a temperature cycle as the components decompose. The temperature is closely monitored because the spore is “sown” as the heat of decomposition declines (I recall it being around 125 degrees). Once the mushrooms are harvested this organic compost is no longer usable commercially, but makes for a nutrient rich fertilizer for the home garden.

For local gardeners the operator of this “farm” made the discarded compost available at either $1.00 per cubic yard if they loaded your dump trunk or free to those loading their pickup truck or U-Haul type trailer themselves.

Although the roughly 1,000 square foot area that I set aside for my vegetable garden was already a rich, black, humus, I transported enough of the mushroom compost with my pickup truck to provide a six inch thick coating in the garden which was then tilled into the soil.

My fellow garden club members sang the praises of the mushroom compost as fertilizer, but did not warn me about how it would effect plant size and harvest production. I learned about this aspect all too rapidly.

I was accustomed to Mom’s tomato plants being about 3 feet tall and 18-20 inches in diameter producing fruit adequate to supply the family’s needs during harvest season. Since my garden area was ten times that of mom’s, I figured that I could plant seven each of Heinz-57, beefsteak, and roma tomato varieties to have enough “excess” crop to do some canning of various tomato products.

I did the same thing with bell peppers, green beans, radishes, beets, and a few other personal favorites. I also experimented with sweet corn interplanted with a pumpkin variety specifically hybridized for pies. Strawberries were also a new crop for me, but I figured “what the heck” since I had the space and barefoot plants from the nursery I dealt with were surprisingly cheap.

My Heinz and Beefsteak varieties had to be staked with 8 foot 2 x 4s because they were between 5 and 6 feet tall and 3-4 feet in diameter. Production was well over 400 pounds of ripe tomatoes and another 50-75 pounds of green tomatoes still on the vine when the first frost hit. I spent many days in the kitchen canning every imaginable variety of tomato product. Then there were the cucumbers for pickles, green beans, corn, beets, and can’t forget the strawberries consuming more evenings and weekends in the kitchens. I was in gourmet heaven! As it turned out, the frozen and home canned garden produce were enough to last me and my then wife until the following year’s harvest.

So, as you can see, for me manure is marvellous once you make it into fertilizer.
