**“What’s Wrong With People?!” by Nate A. Lindell**

Two cups of coffee, my T.V. don’t work, the world’s full of stupidity - it’s time t’ rant!

Sex-Offender Politicians + Powerful

Y’all notice how all these cats being accused of sexual misconduct look like they’d be hiding behind bushes wearing nothing but a raincoat? Weinstein, Franken, Bill Clinton, Conyers - I can’t see Trump hiding behind a bush, but I can imagine him paying a domi’ to piss on him. THose creeps aside, it’s putative Sen. Moore’s scenario that tells me we all ain’t tuned into the same reality: initially multiple times, Moore’s denials were weak, faltering and he blushed like a kid caught with his hand in a baby’s diaper; and multiple women don’t all lie about such things, while victims of childhood sex abuse often wait for decades to speak about it.

Yet that cho-mo has support from the majority of voters!

Prisoners get killed for less evidence than that against Moore! (Speaking of which, if either Slick Willy or Trump found themselves in a U.S. Penitentiary, they wouldn’t be extorted - the whites would kill them, quick, for being sex offenders). But them greedy-ass Republicans got Moore’s back!

Delusions. So many people live in an alternative reality and don’t even realize it, like brainwashed cult members.

Reality

Some people embrace (or have imposed on them) faulty beliefs about what constitutes valid knowledge. Their psycho-epistemology is tainted, making it possible for them to believe up is down, and that the world is flat, that the Earth is only 6,000 years old, that Trump gives a crap about the working class or anyone other than himself, etc, etc.

People are capable of believing this crap because their minds lack a crap filter or they’re so desperate to believe what they believe that they turned their crap filters off.

Religion is often to blame for disabling crap filters. “Scriptures” often demand “blind faith,” or cult leaders demand this, which is why so many fundamentalist Christians refuse to believe in or care about man-caused global warming (Jebus is coming back soon and promised to recreate Eden on Earth!) And, as Romans Chapter 13 commands, blindly obey and trust authority figures such as Moore. This is ironic , because religions also teach that God made us, thus made our brains, and if God made our brains they are good and should be used… yet thoughtless, uncritical belief requires turning our brains off (and what kinda “Almighty” God would give a damn about a human’s criticism or questioning? I’m merely a fallen angel and I love valid criticism of myself!)

Why True Truth Matters

Next time someone runs up on you with a shiv, believe it’s a banana and tell me how that works out. Let ‘em mush that banana on ya a couple times.

You free people, next time a car’s coming when you cross a street, believe it’s a beach ball. Let it bounce off ya and tell me how fun that was.

Reality matters, so wise people tune into it.

Look at Trump’s recent tax plan, literally targeting those who seek and teach higher knowledge (grad students) - knowledge scares the shit out of his kind! - throwing a toothpick at the middle-class and a pizza party for the billionaires and corporations. Ignoring the true truth about Trump is as ill-advised as believing that car is a a beach ball - it’s, gonna, hurt.

Solution

Delusions are hard to pop, especially religious ones that threaten hellfire for merely doubting them, especially when a person is a follower and surrounded by sufferers. The more sure you are about your beliefs and the less willing you are to critically examine them, the more likely it is that you are deluded. If that describes you, now’s your chance to open your eyes.

And the rest of us homo sapiens sapiens need all the open-eyed people we can find if we’re to continue existing and, hopefully, free ourselves from the deluded oppression.
