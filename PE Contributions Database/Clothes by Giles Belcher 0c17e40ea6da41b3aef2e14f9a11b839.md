**Clothes by Giles Belcher**

Man I like these new cowboy boots in black size 13. Good fits, oil resistant, rubber heels and soles should last a long time! The black, blue, and grey denim jeans fit well. They won’t wear out anytime soon! Several new shirts and long sleeve shirts in plaid, grey, white, black, and blue block patterns will work. Not bad for 2-3X shirts, a drover’s coat (a trenchcoat) will keep wind and rain off of you real well! 2 cowboy hats, black and grey colored 2.75 inches fit well to shield eyes from sun, and rain off of your head as well. Have to bend the brim in front down some to set better shade over any eyes. Going to be at least 1000 maybe ? Several overalls for work and shorts, gym clothes to lounge in added for good measure! Simple attire for casual work, or at date night out of town! I’ll deal with hunting and fishing stuff later. I’ve got to go to my new job later on today. Got to be ready to work and look good as well! Appearances and punctuality needed now more than ever! Still relax and look business-like too! They say clothes make or break a person? Just want to be comfortable and not have to buy clothes a lot. Simplicity and durability to lose a good long while! Fun to work and look good doing so! How about you?
