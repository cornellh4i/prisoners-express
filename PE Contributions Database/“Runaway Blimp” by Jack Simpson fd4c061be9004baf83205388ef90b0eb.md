**“Runaway Blimp” by Jack Simpson**

“This will be the trip of a lifetime” is what the sign had printed on it. A man yelled out over the speaker, “Take a ride in the sky, soar like a bird. Enjoy a breathtaking ride. For the price of only five dollars you can enjoy all of this.” I can tell you, when they handed out brains, I really must have been in the sucker line.

A couple of my friends coaxed me into this ride. “George, you would bite into an apple just to make sure there wasn’t a worm in it.” Of course, Fred was right. What he didn’t know, I have a fear of heights. When my family bought a TV antenna, I wanted so much to be the one who mounted it. The back of the house had a small height to it. The front, on the other hand, needed a long ladder just to touch the roof. That sure ended that idea.

“What are you waiting on George? You know you can do this.” Fred just wouldn’t let it go. He kept pushing the idea of going up. “OK, it is settled. I’ll take one ticket.” The cabin was smaller than it looked from the outside. It held one pilot and two passengers. One was a young female around 23 years of age.

No sooner than we lifted off, I had a feeling this was not a good idea. The few hairs on my legs began to stand out. Not from fear, but cold. It was nice and warm on the ground. Of all things, shorts was a mistake. The ride itself was going to last thirty minutes. To my opinion, that would have been twenty-nine minutes too long. We kept going up and up. I wasn’t going to complain about it. After all, it was my idea.

“Oh, look at the mountains in the distance. They look so small.” The young lady kept on and on. Sure didn’t need to hear that. There was no way I was going to look over the edge. My knuckles were already white from my grip. Keeping my eyes level became a task. Once I see Fred again, he is going to get an earful.

Not once did either of us care about time. It seemed like hours since we left the ground, we floated along so slow. I believe a snail coated with Vaseline would pass us. I just had to ask, “Is this thing moving?” The pilot replied, “Sure we are. We are traveling at four miles per hour. One thing you don’t want is a head wind. It would affect our speed.” This was no help either. “How about a little more positivity on this trip?” “Sure”, he replied. “What would you like to talk about?” I knew that he sensed that I was afraid by the cracking in my voice.

The blimp shook as if someone had grabbed it in their hands. Now, I was about to spill everything I had eaten. “Oh my, you look a little green in your face. Do you feel alright?” She kept on and on, she probably thought she was helping. But it didn’t. I think I lost all of my blood Anything that had color to it had to be my feet.

When the pilot said “We are in trouble”, that pretty much put the icing on the cake. It lurched forward and started to drop. Right then, doom hit me and this is isn’t going to be pretty. For some reason, he had lost control of the blimp. No matter what he did, it just would not respond. Of all the things that could happen. Yeah, you guessed it. The woman had gotten hysterical and started to scream. My nerves were shot and before I could say anything to calm her down, the pilot reached over and let some helium out.

The nose of the ship started to rise. I was too scared to speak. The lady had fainted and hit the floor. I felt a little better after that. The poor pilot was busy trying to keep us in the air. He hadn’t noticed her. Several minutes passed before it started down again. He had some control but not a lot could be done.

The ground was coming up. But not too fast, as I could tell. The main thing was that my feet would be back on the ground. It hit with a thump. That is when the lady woke up. The pilot helped her out as I was already on the ground, kissing it.

Fred on the other hand didn’t fare too well. He wore a shiner for a while but we are still good friends. My fear of heights, you may ask? Lets just say that if I have to use a chair to change a lightbulb, I’ll stay in the dark.
