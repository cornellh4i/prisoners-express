**Keeping Calm by Paul Pommells**

Keep calm and have patience is a great piece of advice but sometimes it’s hard for me to do. I have learned that it is harder for me to remain calm and patient when what’s at risk is something or someone I care a lot about.

My life history has taught me to be over protective I believe that I must worry for the things I love I guess my rationale is that if I’m not worrying then I don’t care enough. And somewhere in the back of my mind I must have been tricked to believe that self-imposed worry will strengthen my powers of concentration, but the drawback is that it frays my nerves overtime and can make it hard to remain calm. I’m obviously re-evaluating things.
