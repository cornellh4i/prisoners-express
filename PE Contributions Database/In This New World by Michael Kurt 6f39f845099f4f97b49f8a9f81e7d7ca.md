**In This New World by Michael Kurt**

No longer do I have to be dreaming

In this new world filled with screaming

Whistles blown, shots fired, alarms sounding

In this new world, awake or asleep, it never stops howling

One more body being carried away

In this new world I must endure every day

My chest rises and falls with each breath

In this new world of living with death

Plenty of fears where no one shed any tears

In this new world serving and surviving many years
