**‘Thank You!’ by Edward Williams**

Sometimes it's tough to find inspiration in a world full of evil. Sometimes you'll find the wrong inspiration.

Take me for example. I was treated badly by people and the physical world in general. So I looked to fantasy characters for any inspiration. Yeah, yeah, it’s my fault, I know, for believing these things, but my mind wasn’t well, so don’t stone me. This is a thank you letter from a “recovering” schizophrenic to his inspirational heroes.

Thank you, Goku, you god of a being, for convincing me that it was possible to train the body and mind to become super fast, super strong and super energetic. I’m sure my heart thanks you for giving me such a strong zeal to be like you that I mildy poisoned myself by drinking too much caffeine, trying to juice myself up. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

Thank you, Agent Smith, for teaching me your nihilistic doctrine. It was actually your quote, “The purpose of life is to end”, that helped me to commit a murder, even when I really didn’t want to. Your lengthy speeches really moved me. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

Thank you, Albert Wesker, leader of the Umbrella Corporation, for boosting my already anti-human mindset. I mean, you did try to kill 98% of the human population. With a viral missile! Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

Thank you, Albus Percival Wulfirc Brian Dumbleodre, for not sending me a Hogwarts letter at eleven. I really appreciate your oversight. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

Thank you, Voldemort, for making me think my evil thoughts were okay. Your dark deeds inspired me. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

Thank you, Inu Yasha, for teaching me to sharpen my nails into claws, preparing to slash people’s faces off when they made me angry. I only did it once, in fifth grade, before I had sharpened them. I’m sure he appreciated your mentorship of me. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

Thank you, every person who ever got powers in a movie or comic or book when they turned 16, for bolstering my deep expectation that I, too, would find that path. Indeed, my disappointment was more motivating than the hope. Thanks for helping me find inspiration.

There are more, of course, like the X-Men and Vegeta and Frieza (very villainous, He was) and Jack Krauser, but I can hear the Oscar music playing me out. So thank you all for helping me get locked in a box for a grand total of LWOP years. My fault, yes, I take responsibility for it, but you helped. You really helped.

Suffice it to say that my inspirations didn’t always help me to pursue what was health and/or righteous. You might think, “Well, I’m not schizophrenic, so I can’t be tricked like that.” Perhaps. But many people have been duped by subtler things than overt themes in fiction. Here’s a rule. If you find yourself inspired by something, check to see if what you’re inspired to do is in line with God’s word and if it helps you and your fellow man. If it doesn’t drop it quickly. You might end up like me.
