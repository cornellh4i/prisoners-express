**A Pantoum for Darren Raney by Catherine LaFleur**

An officer is allowed to scald prisoners to death, as long

as she works in the Lock-down unit of the prison.

Meling the skin of the prisoner to the shower tiles

Is not a taboo if that prisoner is mentally ill.

As long as that officer is female, women in power are able

To execute. Mental illness is punishable by

Death as long as the patient prisoner is deleted

If that prisoner is mentally ill.

Women in power are able to execute, but a psychologist

Must look only at the patient prisoner’s imaginary food tray.

The patient prisoner is deleted.

His emaciated body must be covered up

The psychologist must only look at the patient prisoner’s imagine food tray,

And never look at skeleton skin.

An emaciated body must be covered up.

A punishment for humanity is starvation.

To look at the skeleton skin,

Will confirm the patient prisoner is never forgiven.

The punishment for humanity is starvation.

It is illegal to have relationships with a prisoner.

To review the course of events in the written log:

A phone call is required to inform the family of the patient prisoner’s death,

But it is illegal to have relationships with a prisoner.

It is legal to hide the corpse, so long as

A phone call is required to inform the family of the patient prisoner’s death.

An officer is allowed to scald prisoners to death.

Still it is legal to hide the corpse,

So long as an officer is allied to scald prisoners to death.

(*Darren Raney was a mentally ill prisoner held in the lock down unit at Dade Correctional Institute in Florida. He was severely underweight. He was locked into a shower and over several hours scalded to death by corrections officers. The officers had adjusted the temperature valve on the water heater as a punishment. The two officers in command were female. All the officers were acquitted and no wrongdoing was found in Florida Courts in 2017*)
