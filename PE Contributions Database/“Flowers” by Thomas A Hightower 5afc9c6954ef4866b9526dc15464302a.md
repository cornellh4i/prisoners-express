**“Flowers” by Thomas A. Hightower**

I learned early in life that flowers are a most precious way to tell someone how you feel about them. It’s a proof of inner emotions you may not be able to express in words.

Flowers to someone who is sick, injured, or down in the dumps blues, lets that person know you care about them enough to want them to feel better soon. The acknowledgement that you do care, and feel their pain, sparks uplifting feelings in the recipient of your heartfelt jester. The sight of the smile of gratitude is your reward, which in turn causes endorphins in both of you to be released. This biological reaction has amazing healing powers on the mind, body, and soul who was ailing- a real miracle cure. It bonds the two of you closer. It also sparks humanity in you, the giver, which will make you desire to do such acts of kindness over and over again That is what makes us all more human, the source of all healthy humanity.

Flowers in nature are all part of the cycle of life. A major part of a healthy ecosystem. Wild flowers are God’s gift of rebirth to humankind. A sign that life continues to grow and renew each Spring. No human artist can compare to God’s palette of color, for where do you think artists’ colors originated? Flowers are the original colors in paints, dyes, inks for eons- even cave paintings used flowers, earth, and soft rocks as the base of the color palette. Today, modern non synthetic paints still use plants as the raw coloring.

Flowers are signs of respect for our dead. It acknowledges the life of the deceased prior to death. As well as the rebirth of the spirit or soul to the afterlife. It eases the pain of loss the deceased family feels.

Flowers express love. Since time began for the human species, men express hidden desires by giving flowers. Women express love with flowers to their mates as well. Even primates have been seen participating in such rituals.

Equally important- a gift of flowers to express remorse to the receiver, for slights, or cross words done in the heat of passion, or to express contrition for forgetting important rituals such as anniversaries, birthdays, and the like.

The home of many humans, have at least some flowers planted around it or within it. For it brings life to an inanimate structure- making a house a home, or any dwelling small or large.

Our parks and public spaces have become museums of flora and fauna. Great pride goes into heritage parks, memorials, public spaces. This system of public display of horticulture prowess is centuries old.

Flowers are very much a major part of life on our planet. We are often too busy to see just how much our lives are affected by the presence or absence of flowers. So next time you are out of the grey lifeless concrete of your prisons, look around and smell the flowers. Appreciate God’s glorious painting of our planet. Without flowers, blooms, life would not exist. So pay careful attention to these pollinators who spread the nectar of life from bloom to bloom worldwide. Protect the bees and butterflies, as well as the flowers of our world. Just look at how sad, dreary a prison is- it’s because there are no gardens, no flowers, no signs of life’s simple joys. Now imagine a world that was colorless, lifeless, as a prison’s concrete landscape. Stand up for life- plant a garden first chance you get- sponsor a beehive so our pollinators thrive. Be part of a healthy, beautiful humanity. Let your green thumb show through.

Next time you’re outdoors, take the time to appreciate the gallery of colors God has made!
