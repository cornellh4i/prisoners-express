“Grandparents” by Jennifer Robinson

My grandparents have all passed from this life, but they all left me their legacies in some form or another. Not all of them have been good. My dad’s mother left me a legacy of love. She loved me more than anyone else in my family. She taught me to love unconditionally. She also taught me that spirituality and religion was important by following Christ. My dad’s father left the legacies of hard work and perseverance in life. He was an amazing man who worked hard to provide for his family and give them the life they deserved. He lived a long life and many people saw the good in him. Now my mother’s mother had her good side, but I have a hard time remembering it. The legacy she left me was a struggle with self-doubt and second-guessing my every action. I struggle with this to this day, especially as a parent. My mother’s father was mentally ill. I inherited mental illness through my mother’s side. I take medication and sit in therapy sessions. I also use spirituality as treatment. These legacies my grandparents have left me are a part of who I am today. I honor the good and the bad.
