**“Tuned In” By John Naylor**

Ever hear your name and perk up? Or walk by someone like they’re invisible when they’re calling out to you? Our psychiatrist Dr. Perry calls that a post hypnotic state. You’re technically unconscious I guess you’d say. Growing up deep in thought my mom would say “Dennis, I need you to tune in here,” and he defensively reacted, “I was thinking.” she never said, “Don’t hurt yourself.” That’s just not her. And he’s not the type to take a jab without a perry band(?). I always thought it was strange. It seemed as if he was caught breaking a piece of fine China. Maybe he got in trouble for thinking at some point in his life. He went to Alexandria High School in north Madison County, Indiana. It’s not IPS. but they may still punish kids for thinking, “I’m not sure”. Still when I hear that phrase I think of my mom and dad. “I was not thinking!” Which is a close cousin to the dramatic pause defense to an interjection “I was taking a breath!” Dramatic pause, “as I was saying…” Even an odd interaction was a moment to make a memory. My mom I know some today would be. I credit that to her character and understanding.
