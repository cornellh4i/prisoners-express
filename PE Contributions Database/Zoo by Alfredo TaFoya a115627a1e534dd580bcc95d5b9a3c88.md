**Zoo by Alfredo TaFoya**

I remember the field trips to the Zoo I took as a child fondly. Seeing a Polar Bear stand up in front of me was a thing of wonder. The Zoo was a place of odd creatures and wonderful beasts. As odd as it was it lacked a natural feeling. My young mind back then was still able to comprehend that the animal's spirit wanted to be somewhere else. Now as a convict, a healthy disdain for enclosures and guardians in uniform has developed. This dislike has affected the way I feel about Zoos, frankly I believe they are abhorrent. You take a creature out of its natural habitat and you also take its purpose. An animal's purpose in life which is its ability to positively impact its environment. That delicate harmony of the ecosystem which sustains life for all its inhabitants misses a note every time an animal is killed or plucked away for entertainment. Since the animals are no longer fulfilling their divine purpose, their life goes to waste. No contributions can be made to the ecosystems through the confines of the Zoo. I recognize I’m making some overstatements, but it's my paper I can write what I want to. But more than the fact I’m incarcerated, I also have become acquainted with naturist concepts. I do believe humankind should live in harmony with Earth. Instead of destroying our sustainable existence of Earth and that of other species as well.
