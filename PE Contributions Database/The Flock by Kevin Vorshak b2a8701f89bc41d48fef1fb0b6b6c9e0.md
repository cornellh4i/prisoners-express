***The Flock* by Kevin Vorshak**

****Mark marveled at the effortlessly synchronous flight of the birds. His friend Bill said they were starlings. Whatever they were, the flock seemed endless -- easily numbering in the thousands. They flew back and forth in intricate patterns. The contrast between their lighter bellies and darker backs added a certain depth. How they avoided smashing into each other and raining downward in a flurry of feathers and broken bodies seemed like a God-given miracle.

The sun laid high on an unseasonably warm November day. Mark dug his peanut butter sandwich out of the bag beside him and leaned back against the tree. He checked his watch and still had 45 minutes until his psychology class.

He pulled out a package of kettle cooked potato chips and a bottled water from the bag. Tearing open the chips, he set it in the grass before popping the cap from the water and taking a sip.

Mark took a bite of his sandwich, fished a chip from the bag, and regarded the starlings. A part of the flock snaked across the sky, forming a lazy “S.” He took another sip of water and a chip while the birds cut back across. This time, he thought he made out an “A”. But when the next pass produced a well-defined “R,” he let the half-eaten sandwich slide back into the bag and studied the flock more intently.

“Mind if I join you?”

Mark jerked his head around to find Sarah Lombard standing behind him, smiling and wearing a pair of faded jeans and a light blue sweater. She carried a dark windbreaker draped over her arm. He stole a quick glance at the birds which seemed to be acting as a flock should, before replying. “Umm… no, not at all.”

“You OK, Mark? I’m sorry if I scared you,” she said as she dropped down beside him.

“I’m fine, I guess. I was watching the starlings. They were…” What? Spelling Sarah’s name? How is that possible? And why? Mark returned his gaze to the flock which now simply swarmed en masse.

“They were what?”

“They were… flocking.”	Sarah laughed. “Yeah, they do that this time of year. I love to sit and watch them.”

Mark liked her laugh. “Me too. I like the quiet while I eat and enjoy their anties.” Was that a question mark they formed? Were they questioning him now?

“And here I am jabbering and disturbing your quiet time.” Sarah started to rise.

Mark reached over and gently grasped her elbow, “Please stay, Sarah. I like you. I didn’t mean it to sound like that.” He felt her relax and let his hand slide down to hers. She didn’t pull away.

“I like you too,” she said. She slid closer to him and laid her head on his shoulder.

Mark decided to skip his psychology course. As they watched, he thought for a moment that he saw a “thumb’s up.”
