**Helping Hand by Christopher Welthuysen**

When a person who has been incarcerated asks for a “Helping Hand” it is very much appreciated when he/she receives it; because as anyone who has been incarcerated as long as me (32 years now) knows our resources are very limited, and In my case; more limited due to lack of funds, poor job pay, and much Federal, State, Institution Fees (4,200 accumulated over 10 years now); So when a family member suddenly pops-up after 30+ years and offers to (assist me), (tells me they love me), and (offers to advocate for me to the parole board), (come VISIT)-I just “pray to god” for his loving helping hand!!!

Has anyone else experienced similar helping hands from family, friends, or loved ones? Do you wish to share? Write to me.

Is “anyone” willing to “helping hand” me through my “parole hearing” and willing to be my representative, write fast as It Is coming up soon. Who can provide me with (any) assistance for (If) I’m released to guarantee my chances of parole success If freed? (Disregard this parole I was denied already).

A “Helping Hand” will be needed as I’ve been incarcerated since (16 years old), (now 48); So I will be literally starting over, and have done all I can to receive a parole, (I have a +7-high probability of parole on my P.E.R. parole eligibility report), (I’m In S.A.A. program for my sexual addictions with a sponsor Joe), (Just finished the start now program here at: Oaks Correctional Facility), (have never been fired or written a misconduct on the job In 32 years, and have received no work performance reports below average score of 28); (have received a lot of certificates in floor maintenance, gardening/horticulture, General library, typing, computers, small engine repairs, welding, furniture making, business/accounting),(have completed A.A., N.A., group counseling, work keys, anger management, and start now programs), (have received my G.E.D. 1996, along with post-G.E.D. classes In business administration, accounting, American government ,U.S. History. College level math-trigonometry and calculus), (have enrolled in creative writing classes, resume classes, poetry writing and book writing clubs), (have maintained employment). In conclusion; a “helping hand” can benefit anyone!
