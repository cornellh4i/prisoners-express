**My Body by Tamara Angelique Allenbaugh**

Listen up, I am more than my body. Don’t judge me based on my anatomical structure or the body I was given at birth. I am a woman, hear me roar! Countless have judged me on what they see, a male body. Hurtful words have been thrown at me, wounding more deeply than any knife you could cut me with. People don’t understand the concept of gender. Most believe what they were taught—only two genders exist. Transgenderism doesn’t equate in their narrow minds. I am a woman, regardless of how my physical body may betray. My spirit and personality are female, as is my mind. Regardless of what others may say or believe, I am a woman. Why do you hate me? Why do you hate what you cannot understand? Why do you hate what is beyond your narrow conception of reality. My body—appearances may be deceiving.
