**Thankful by Cesar Hernandez**

I usually drive around my boss in their Rolls Royce. My boss frequently shops at Saks Fifth Avenue. I shop there for a few things. I can’t afford to buy several five hundred dollar shirts. I can at least buy one three hundred dollar shirt.

On this day I had no idea there was a surprise for me. This was about one week before my birthday. We arrive at Saks Fifth Avenue and valet park. What I don’t know is that my boss already called ahead. My boss wanders off to another department while I go to the men’s department. I see that my personal shopper is working today. She seems extra nice today. She is always nice but today she is in a great mood. She starts pulling all kinds of very expensive things. She knows I only buy expensive things, not very expensive things. After a while my phone rings. My boss says that they are done shopping and to meet at Starbucks. I say goodbye to my personal shopper without buying anything.

When we get to the valet the shopping bags are already in the trunk. I drop my boss off at their house. My boss tells me to get my shopping bags out of the trunk. I remind my boss that I didn’t buy anything so I don’t have any shopping bags. In the drunk are eleven shopping bags. Five of those are mine. I had no idea that my boss called my personal shopper to pick lots of things I liked. When my boss and I were at Starbucks everything was paid for and put in the trunk of the car. I thank my boss for buying me nine thousand dollars worth of clothes.
