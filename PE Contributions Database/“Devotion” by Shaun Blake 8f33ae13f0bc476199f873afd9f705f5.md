**“Devotion” by Shaun Blake**

The morning of the big day Safayah arose early from bed. She walked to the cheval glass, admiring herself, gently massaging her face. Loving her smooth, light brown complexion, her thin frame outlined under her thin nightgown— beautiful.

A knock on her door. “Come,” Safayah said, turning from her reflection. It’s time. Two servants enter and set about their business. The older woman never spoke, but the younger one never shut up, chattering constantly as she worked.

They filled her bath with hot water and scented fragrant oils. The girl pulled Safayah’s nightgown over her head and helped her into the tub. The heat felt cleansing. The older woman washed her hair, gently combing out the snags. The girl scrubbed Safayah ‘til she shined pinkish-brown. She told Safayah how lucky she was. Safayah said nothing.

When clean the servants helped Safayah from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed Safayah’s hair until it gleamed like polished ebony, while the older woman applied cosmetics and anointed her with jasmine perfume at key locations.

They dressed her in the yellow-chiarosured gown intricately arabesqued with gold and silver threads and precious gems. The girl braided Safayah’s hair, decorating it with moonstones that dangled over her forehead. The old women adorned Safayah’s fingers with gemstoned rings and slipped various precious-metaled bracelets on her wrists— one dangling a small key like a charm. They attached a priceless ceremonial torc around her neck. Lastly, the old woman slipped gilded sandals onto her feet, the girl affixed a gown-matching headdress. “Now you look like a princess,” the girl said breathlessly. Safayah glanced at her image in the cheval glass. She felt goosebumps pebble her body.

After the servants departed Safayah’s mother entered, admired her daughter, and escorted her out of the house. Proudly displaying her daughter to the cheering crowd that awaited, Safayah’s mother paraded her daughter through the streets to the Shrine of Deliverance where the ceremony was held. The proud mother reveled in this signal accomplishment of Safayah’s. Her family would rise in rank this day.

The sun was setting as they arrived at the Deliverance, the sky blazed with mystery. The Shrine of Deliverance is a simple courtyard for worshippers with an altar at the western edge. A priest in amethyst robes stands at the altar. Nobody else is inside the Deliverance. The courtyard is surrounded by hundreds though. Safayah kisses and hugs her mother— clinging desperately for a moment— then walks to the altar. Bowing, the priest hands Safayah a lit and an unlit candle. She bows in return, lights the unlit candle, sets it on the altar, extinguishes the priest’s lit candle, and disguards it. Kneeling a short distance from the altar, Safayah steeples her hands, bows her head, closes her eyes, and prays.

He joins her at the altar. A severe-looking young man in ceremonial warrior-priest dress, a long sword hanging sheathed at his side. He stops slightly behind and to the left of Safayah. Without looking at her he sets his feet, left hand resting on his sword-hilt, his eyes straight ahead into the setting sun.

The priest takes an ornate chest from the altar and sets it reverently in front of Safayah then returns to this former place. Opening her eyes, Safayah pulls the chest closer and takes the key dangling from her wrist, opening the chest. A small vial of clear liquid is inside. Taking it out she kisses it, pulls the stopper loose, and kissing it, sets it inside the chest.

The priest speaks for the first time: “This solemn ceremony is dedicated to our fertility god, Zoridyah. We gather at this time that symbolizes an ending. This wedding ceremony solemnizes a new beginning— with this sacrifice of life, for life.”

Looking closely at the two figures in front of him he asks, “Do you willingly enter this joining?”

“I do!” Safayah answers loudly, quickly drinking the liquid from the vial.

“It is done,” the priest says. “You are now married to our Lord, Zoridyah.”

With these words the young warrior-priest unsheaths his sword, brings it up over his right shoulder, his right leg stepping back a pace, and with a soft grunt he swiftly sweeps his sword down and through Safayah’s tender-fleshed neck.

Safayah’s head falls to the ground with a dull thud rolling a couple feet into the side of the chest. It stops with her beautiful, smiling face illumined by the last glint of the setting mystery.

The crowd cheers!
