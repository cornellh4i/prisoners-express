**“Waiting for Opportunity” by Michael Lanning**

Remember the phrase “Being at the right place at the right time.” There is a great importance where one waits for their opportunity in life. Waiting at the wrong place means not understanding life or not being awake to loving. It is like waiting for the subway at a bus station or a ship at the airport. Someone might laugh at you and ask if you are waiting for a blimp.
