All these fellas are listening to me as I told them about our mission. They all knew that we were embarking upon a new era in American history. Never before had blacks been able to participate in an ongoing war campaign.

I told them that as a white man I was just as proud (or more so) of them as any other soldier. I told them not to let anyone degrade them or look down on them because of their skin color.

I am the leader of our platoon. I told the whites in our platoon that if they treated the black men any different than the other men they would answer to me. (I only had to reprimand one man.)

I am proud to say that all the men you see in this photo returned from the war unharmed physically. I am sure they saw some things theyâ€™d rather not have, but that is war. I still remember every one of their names, and I even talk to a couple of them every few months.

I am proud to have been the platoon leader of the first black American soldiers!
