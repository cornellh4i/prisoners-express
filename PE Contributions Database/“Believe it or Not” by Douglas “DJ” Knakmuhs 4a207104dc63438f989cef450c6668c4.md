“Believe it or Not” by Douglas “DJ” Knakmuhs

Believe it or not, I know an angel. She’s the most beautiful woman in the world. She’s got a heart of gold and everyone that knows her, loves her. You see, this angel is my mom, and she’s awesome. She’s had my back through everything. Believe me, “everything” is a lot too.

I remember when I got locked up at the age of twelve, my mom used to come see me every visiting day. I felt special because most of the other kids in the juvenile detention never got visitors. I remember my mom used to bring me extra snacks on the visit so I could smuggle them back up to my cell to eat late at night when I was hungry.

Believe it or not, my mom never gave up on my. Even when I was strung out and in the grip of madness. My angel always loved and believed in me. To this day she tells me that my life will only be as limited as my dreams aspire to reach. She makes me want to be a better man.

Finally!

This angel is my best friend. I can tell her anything and she never judges me. If you asked her, she’d tell you I’m the greatest person alive. Without my angel, I really don’t know what I’d do. I truly feel blessed because I’m lucky to have the mom I got.

She’s that mama bear that would die to protect her cubs. She’s that beautiful bird that toils all day long to bring back food to feed her young. She’s that water buffalo that valiantly fights off the lions as best as she can to protect her young. She’s that pitbull that you don’t want to approach after she has her pups because you know her instinct to protect is stronger than her urge to eat.

She’s all that and more.

My angel lifted me up out of the dirt after I wrecked my bike as a child and cried out “MOMA!” I remember one time when I was in kindergarten and the teacher wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom and I peed my pants in class. When I came home and told my mom what happened, she changed my clothes and told me to get in our car. It was an old Vega and I’ll never forget how mad my mom was. What normally would’ve been a ten minute drive was driven in three minutes flat!

Let me tell you, when my moma is mad, she is MAD! That day, she was livid. She marched into that principal’s office and smacked those wet pants on his desk and gave him the business! My mom was an archangel that day. I’ll never forget that.

My mom saved my life one night. After battling bouts of extreme depression, I decided to end my life one night and when my mother and my step-dad realized I had swallowed a bunch of pills, they took action. My mom called 911, and my step-father gave me CPR.

We live out in the boonies and my mom was forced to run down an old farm road to guide the ambulance to our house. My mother, who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day and smokes all the weed she can, RAN down a farm road. She saved my life that night, along with my step-dad.

So believe it or not, I guess I know two angels.

I love my mom more than anything and now I’m thirty-eight year old and I worry about losing her. What would I do without my angel? I’ll tell you what I’d do; I’d keep moving forward. Or as my mom always tells me at the end of all her letters, “Keep a stiff upper lip!”

That’s a hell of a saying ain’t it? Never let the world see you with your head down. Hold it high and keep a stiff upper lip!
