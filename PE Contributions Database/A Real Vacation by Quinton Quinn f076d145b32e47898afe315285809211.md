**A Real Vacation by Quinton Quinn**

Leaning against the smooth surface of the boulder I could feel its heat penetrating my aching back muscles. The clouds above my head flooded so slowly across the translucent grayish blue sky, that I too drifted away…

“You kids better be ready to go when I hit that door. If not, I’m going to work and let you all walk to school by yourselves, I want to see good reports; remember good grades equals vacation.” Shouted my mother from the bathroom.

I can’t remember the first time my mom promised us we’d go on a real vacation if we got good grades. Like usual though, the summers came and went.

Before we knew it the first day of school had arrived again. So when mom said vacation again it fell into broken ears. When we got home from school momma was sitting on the porch with a big smile on her face. She had changed into her housecoat and slippers.

“Why are you smiling?” asked my sister.

“First of all good evening to you too. And since you ask so nice, I would prolong the surprise- we’re going on vacation!” screamed mom. We’re going to Astroworld, but we’re going to attend Mr. Perry’s sister’s wedding first.

We started doing our happy dance when mom suddenly yelled, “Where are those report cards?”

“All of our grades were good so we quickly handed them out.”

We met at the dinner table at our usual time. Mr. Perry had arrived and was seated at the head of the table. He’s my mother’s boyfriend, and always seems to show at dinnertime. My Perry was a cowboy to his heart, and from the few Christmases we’re known him he’d always give us cowboy hats and boots. Neither one of us boys was trying to be cowboys. But my baby brother, he would wear his cowboy boots and rise his imaginary horse in the front yard yelling, “Bang! Bang!” all day long.

Once the dinner table was cleared, momma told us to get packing, because we’re leaving for Texas tomorrow evening.

Saturday evening we were all packed up and ready to go. We loaded up in Mr. Perry’s old Chevy pick up with the camper and headed for the highway.

Seem like we’d been on the road forever when we finally crossed the border from Lousianna into Texas. I don’t know exactly when I fell sleep, but when I opened my eyes we were pulling up to a big white house and it was leaning like the tower of Pisa.

Mr. Perry’s family was huge, there were people everywhere and lots of food too. Some of the best fried chicken I had ever tasted besides momma’s.

Mr. Perry’s nephew who they called Dam Dam pulled me by the arm and asked me to come with him to feed Lilly.

“Who is Lilly?” I asked.

Bam Bam casually said “You’ll see”

“Why they call you Bam Bam”

“Because I never wear shoes or a shirt, just my cut offs,” he answered proudly.

When we got to the backyard I noticed a big fence in the shape of a square, and there was something inside, looked kinda like a cow or a sick moose.

“What the heck is that?” I asked bam bam.

“I don’t know, my uncle won it in a poker game, and he says its a yak. But granny said that yak’s only live in the mountains, not Texas.”

“Well Lilly is ugly and smells bad- feed it and let's go” I said, “And hurry!”

It was the third day that we had been in Texas, and I noticed something wasn’t right with mom, out of the blue she decided we needed to go shopping for a few more summer clothes. Mr. Perry wasn’t there, so his sister dropped us off at the mall. I guess her and mom knew something that we kids didn’t because they hugged like they were never going to see each other again.

We never went into the mall. Mama waved down a cab. We were in shock as we got in.

“Greyhound bus station please,” She looked at us and said “Don’t ask any questions, we’re going home.”

And that was it- vacation over.

The first day of school arrived. We all left at our usual time, so momma was able to walk us to school. Back to normal, I thought.

The first thing our teacher asked us to do was to take out notebooks and write. At least one sentence about our summer vacation. I wrote three words- worst vacation ever.

The sound of crunching grass suddenly snapped me back and there it was ten feet away, a big ugly Yak! I raised my 35mm, and zipped off a few shots… I thought to myself, after thirty years, finally a real vacation.
