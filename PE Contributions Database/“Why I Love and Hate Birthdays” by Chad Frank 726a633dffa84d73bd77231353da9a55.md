**“Why I Love and Hate Birthdays” by Chad Frank**

I have a love/hate relationship with birthdays. When I was a little kid, I loved birthdays for the same reason most little kids do: presents, parties, cake and ice cream. My favorite parties were the ones I had at Chuck E. Cheese’s when I was four and five. I especially loved the mechanical band that came to life to perform just for me. My mom would always go all-out, buying party favors and decorations, even customizing cakes to match my latest obsessions---He-man and WWF wrestling were recurring themes.

I hated birthdays because I was born on September 8th, which usually falls on Labor Day weekend. As a result, my birthday party also often served as a Labor Day barbecue, which took the focus off of me. Some years, I had to go back to school on my birthday---if that’s not a party-pooper, then I don’t know what is. I guess it could’ve been worse.

Once I became a teenager, I’d celebrate my birthday by getting drunk and stoned. For my 21st birthday, my mom took me out for drinks. That would be my last “real” birthday. I got locked up shortly after my 22nd birthday, and have spent every birthday since in prison. When I was in higher security, where there’s more vice, I’d drink some moonshine and smoke a “cap” of weed. None of that’s going on here, so I have to make due with tamer celebrations. As I write this in late March, I’m coming out of a barrage of birthday celebrations, since many of my friends were born this month. My boyfriend Jess is usually the one planning the celebrations, which take place in the computer room after pizza, cheesecakes, and other dishes made by inmates that rival free-world food. It may not be much, but it helps knowing that people care enough to celebrate your birthday with you.
