**"Extraordinary Happiness" by Jeremy Brown**

When I was younger around 14 years of age, my biological father and I drove from California to Florida. My dad’s name is Donny Lynn Brown. He grew up in Kentucky, but was a surfer at heart with a mane of yellow. At 54 years of age, he taught me a lot on our road trip.

“Dad?”

“Yes Son?” he’d respond.

“Let’s get a bow and arrow, I want you to teach me archery.”

“Are you sure? You’re a city boy. You don’t really want to learn, do you? You’re still all electrified from the city, although not so much as when you came up here to California.”

“Yes I’m sure Dad. But before we do this, let’s go to church.”

“You know me and God don’t believe in each other right?”

“I know it’s just I feel the need for some church! Free coffee and doughnuts! Me and you both know it’s a business, sometimes it’s good to fake it and be around others.”

“Alright this one time.”

My father really hated church, but I was a little son of a bitch who liked to play tricks and get under people's skin. This quaint little church had a great group of eclectic individuals. Very optimistic and positive people. At a young age, I was very intelligent and knew that it would be good for my father and me to be around new people and situations. Life is full of different places and faces and I wanted to see it and experience them all!

After we finished our church adventure, my dad was grumpy and real quiet. He could be like that, very moody and sensitive at times. Maybe it was because I had put my foot on the brake pedal and jumped out of a moving vehicle to go to church. Haha. I was bold, too bold. In contrast, when dad was happy, his energy was magnetic. His aura just drew people out of the dust, I must say!

We drove to an army surplus store and picked up a handmade bow made of oak. With arrows for 500 dollars, I was very happy. My dad sure as hell wasn’t because of the price, but I was spoiled as a child even though we didn’t have a lot. We drove out to the desert and were now somewhere in New Mexico. We first set up camp and then fired off on targets. Back then, my dad had a compact bow with a scope!

“Let me try yours, Dad!”

“You ain’t strong enough Son,” he spoke like a cowboy, or John Wayne, whom he idolized. “But I love you enough to trust ya. Take a good pull and see if it doesn’t do you in,” he replied. I notched an arrow and it took off so fast, it busted our 15 dollar styrofoam targets in half. I had set up all targets in a special angle, one behind another. “Holy shit, there goes another 15 dollars but damn, you’re strong boy!” He actually started whooping and hollering. His girlfriend Loretta was from Texas and she remained in the background the whole time, as if she knew the inner power I had within. Her and I liked each other a lot. She told me if I was 18 and had a beard, she would be with me and we’d date. But I was too young and she said she, “...wasn’t no cougar.”

Later on that night, my dad fired us up some smokes and let me drink some white wine. He wouldn’t allow me to smoke weed. He said I was too young and he wouldn’t be babysitting. He was pushing me to be a man at 14 and to be honest, I loved him for it and hated it at the same time. I was always somewhat of a rebel as a kid, yet I could be good too. There’s the duality of human nature. “Son, this is the only time I will allow you to drink, I don’t care if you smoke. You’ve shown great skill and here’s your reward.” That was one of the times my father was truly beaming with energy, when I started to show promise.

Eventually, we made it to Mississippi while picking up a few hitchhikers along the way. They were really strange and cool. One stood out though. His name was Tiny Tim and he was a carnie. What a fucking character this guy was. He could stand on his head, fix anything, shoot, and make everyone laugh as well. He had some bad luck when he lost his job after he came to work drunk and lost a finger setting up one of his rides. After doing a variety of jobs, people began to call him Tiny Tim because of his middle finger is so small. He flicked off a lot of people too, so the name stuck. One day he said to me after we smoked some ganja, “I was tired of it, so one day I left everything. My house and my woman and I got up and went just about everywhere.”

I asked, “How old are ya Tiny Tim?”

“22 I think. I can’t remember much. Too much drugs.”

Later we got a hotel, turned on the news, and we soon discovered Tiny Tim had killed over 10 people and escaped a mental hospital for the criminally insane! Good thing we weren’t killed. As my Dad went out to get groceries, Loretta cried on my shoulder and we kissed. She was a tall buxom blond with red ruby lips and a full bosom... But that was it. “That’s only a taste of what real manhood is,” she said to me. Dad came back with some liquor and weed. “Y'all deserve a treat for my ignorance, coulda got us all killed.” That’s the first time I had ever seen him tear up. I received extraordinary happiness later that night when I was high and got to see my dad’s girl strip for both of us. The freakiest road trip ever. **My dad was a biker and Indian, so this was his treat to me teaching me about our “other side.”**
