**“In the Blink of an Eye” by Mark Hanson**

In the blink of an eye a new song sang to my heart. It all began with these crazy, recurring dreams that always haunted me long after I awoke and rose from that mad, enchanted fairy-land. Somehow, deep down, I know someone - God, my spirit-guide, whatever the case may be - was calling me to a higher purpose than the trivial B.S. I’d wasted and devoted so much of my old life to. It was a scary thing, this learning to trust in the unseen, supernatural, however you choose to believe, but I had nothing to lose with a life sentence and a world that had long since given up on me. So I ventured off on my own little spiritual odyssey.

Big pun intended in that description, for these winds of fate were taking me off the beaten path to the extreme. Epiphanies like violent squalls and banshees did me most good. Though I wasn’t so thankful when those freezing gales were howling down, seemingly intent on my misery and extinction.

So what am I really saying? Am I claiming to be some “noble avatar” sent to lead struggling, suffering mankind on from here across the fiery bridge to the other side? The answer is no, no, and no! What little I’ve figured along the way has only multiplied my questions and quest to the Nth degree. I just want to be as one with our vast, mysterious Universe so profound and unknowable, me a little “knower” or grain of sand on the infinite seashore of possibility. If that sounds like so much transcendental BS, to each his own. Or hers, for women possess some subtle wisdom and drink from a hidden cup or sacred well men never see.

Consider this. We each have a unique calling and a hand to play in this strange game called life, so get in where you fit in. And never quit, keep reaching and seeking ‘til you find, then do it again. Fake it ‘til you make it, and if a storm blows you ashore on some deserted island? Burn your boat, then make you a home! And if it’s lonely? Listen close, for seagulls and the whispering wind want to be your friends. Then listen again, and keep doing it, ‘til their song begins to make sense. This miracle of synchronicity will speak in midst of these so-called “simple” things, and that’s when you’ll know you’ve found your own. Let them speak to your soul like a sweet sunrise after a long dark night. No need to overcomplicate this like some big jigsaw puzzle - even children sing this song. The smarter we are, the harder it is to hear this beat. Stop thinking so much and just be, then you’re free. Does anyone hear this song to a restless sea? Dream on and always believe. Peace.
