**Tricky Business by Douglas Knakmuhs**

Sometimes in life we’re confronted with a situation that is so intimidating that we feel at a loss. We all know that the “system” can be tricky in the best of times. If we don't know the law at all, then how can we enforce the rights we have left? In prison, we’re stripped of our pride and the only way we can get that back is through facing our fears and overcoming them. By doing that, we come to see that we are strong individuals.

A year ago, a guard in the prison I’m at took it upon himself to be judge, jury and executioner with me one day. I was on the phone when he came in the wing, told me to get off and when I didn’t move fast enough, he started to hit me In front of everyone. All I could do was put my head down and cover up. He slammed me to the ground and kept on beating me until the other guards pulled him off of me. I was knocked out, my eye was swollen, my head was split open and my ribs were broken. Needless to say, I didn't win that one.

So they took me to the “hole” and the nurses refused to help me at all. You see; the guard said I swung on him first and he was therefore justified in the force he used against me. As we all know, all staff stick together and so the nurses wouldn’t help me.

So I was written-up for “assault” and I’ve been in the “hole” ever since. I didn’t really care that the guard did what he did to be honest, what bothered me is that he lied to cover up his actions and because of that; I lost my outdated and I’ve been confined In the “hole” every since.

So I decided to fight back with the only thing available to us. For the past year I’ve studied civil law in order to right the wrongs done against me. Three months ago I filed my very first “1983” and to be honest, I’ve never been more intimidated by anything else In my life. Not because I don’t understand the things I’ve taught myself over the past year, but because as anyone knows that has been down this road, It’s a little bit tricky.

I am doing the best I can at this point because for once in my life I’m in the right. Lucky for me there was a camera that caught the whole incident on tape, but I still feel intimidated because what if I mess up? The court creates traps for people like us in an attempt to take our voice from us. It’s the trickiest business in our land. So I stay in the law books I’ve obtained in order to give me the confidence I need to do this. I’m far from a dummy and at the end of the day, I’ll win this fight. I have to.

I look at it like this, the only way to bring about change within our lives is to educate ourselves so that when we are faced with a “tricky” situation, we can face It head on and prevail against all odds. At times we are surrounded by enemies because of the life we choose to live, but we don’t have to be victims any longer.

I’ve become a staunch advocate of the small rights we have. I’ve got that fire within me now and even though I know the road ahead of me will be “tricky” at times, I have truth on my side and at the end of the day, the truth will always come to light. So wish me luck everybody.
