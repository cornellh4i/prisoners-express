**Untitled by Terrell L. Gravely**

When I first received this newsletter, P.E. Express Newsletter Winter 2019, I was more than astounded by its perfect timing. I felt immediate gratitude and was humbled down in that place we reserve for thinning hopes and past glimpses of life’s gifts we have received that have sustained us through our most defeated periods of life. I instantly recognized the Anabel Taylor Hall address that I had written to a couple months ago with 7 or 8 other addresses listed as “resources”. Yet P.E. was the only responder.

I’ve always written, yet never completed anything outside of legal motions, letters to those fleeting souls we once trusted and held dear, so diatribal works fueled with anger, past wrongs and other pointless rhetoric that only breeds continuing pain. But I have found myself in an isolated environment, alone but for my captors who have shown me unconditional love and respect that is far from any required duty. During the year I’ve been here I have been betrayed on the most vile levels, and had my life’s possessions blatantly stolen, meted out in conspiracy, with a girl I loved dearly and two of my oldest closest “friends”, each friend of 40+ years and we are all only 50. There was seemingly no remorse or consideration for me whatsoever.

I’m facing a lengthy prison sentence for something I truly did not do so, I once again found myself filing motions, battling my attorney, and just trying to survive my own hopelessness each day. I finally was able to file some charges via the magistrate only to have them sabotaged in court by the local commonwealth's attorney office - quite purposely - and blatantly.

However, I was able to show the girl and my two lifelong friends what I was feeling being alone, separated before them, and ignored by the prejudicial judge, and the unsupportive prosecutor, but as I saw their smug faces fade to shame, the most unexpected feelings emerged at the moment.

I felt compassion. I felt sad for them. Healing is slow but I’m learning the art of patience. For me, writing has been instrumental in processing all these emotions and reconsidering my initial goals to retrieve my stuff and for them to be jailed.

I found the reward for me to be in the entire forgiving process, and they have lost me as a friend, I was stricken from the courtroom, Juvenile and Domestic, because the girl and I had lived together in the previous 2 months prior, so I wasn’t even allowed to watch the case after giving my own testimony, which they allowed for about 5 minutes. The bottom line is I’m in an orange jail suit so nothing I do, did, or said meant anything. They whisked me out, my handcuffed hand trying to hold all the pictures and letters of confessions, evidence spilling all on the floor. Having to get on my knees in front of everyone, shackled and handcuffed - gathering my months of preparation, was the most humiliating indignity of my life.

So when I began to write about the picture of the blimp for this project, my first impulse was to write about the horrible May 6, 1937 Crash of the Hidenburg and the deaths of 36 people, but I decided to wait and began to wonder why I was so hesitant to tell what I know about the theories of why it crashed, who is to blame, etc. I thought maybe it was a subconscious reason because of my dad being a pilot and my mom a flight attendant earlier in life, and my fears of airline crashes.

But I’ve come to believe, or what I’m choosing to see in this picture is not a tragedy at all. It is an image of hope and serenity. Of the amazing progress man has made in aviation not only through incredible accomplishments in the field of aerodynamics, but also the simple physics concept of heated air.

By re-examining our initial goals, or feelings as they relate to situations, images, or anything really. We can choose to be patient and consider our current mindset, emotions before we act on impulse. Because I waited until some very melancholic emotions passed, I was able to see this picture in a more positive light, and now to me, the picture, the Blimp is an anagrammatic image because: Beauty Lies In My Perspective.
