**“Making Love” by Teddy Lewis**

Everytime I wake up it’s like the Earth makes sweet love to me. No, I’m NOT talking about sex, but love in the midst of my disposition. I feel like God presides all over the prison and the greatest followers shall come from the prison system. It’s a pure euphorical thought of making love to this pen that writes these words which cause my mind to suddenly fluctuate so far beyond prison that true success on any level is within my grasp. Life’s journey is filled with ups and downs, trials and tribulations but if you look closely at your sudden surroundings you should notice what making love is all about because the Earth is making love right at this moment to you.

Peace,

T. Lewis
