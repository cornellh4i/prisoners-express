I went to my girl’s cosmetology class and sat in her chair so she could do my nails. I’m not going to front: the girls were really nice so I asked how do I get in here. My girl asked everyone if they’d like me there, and they responded, “What do you think? Yeah, he’s ok.” After, three girls cut my hair, and this was the best haircut I ever had since I was surrounded by girls who were hugging and kissing me. Ultimately, I changed my class from physical fitness to this, and I learned how to cut hair and do nails. I had the most fun cutting hair in this class.

Remember sitting in the barber chair for the first time,

the red cape around my neck, then I heard the chimes of the door.

What will it be, baldy, OK, he turned around the chair so I can see.

Hair was fallin’ off, started from the top fall down the front.

The floor had my hair on it, the barber wiped my head. “There, youngo.

$5.” Looking in the mirror, wow, rubbing my head in the mirror.Went and got a durag, I was the man with all colors of durags.

Mad girls said, “You is nice

without your hair.” Thank God for that haircut.
