***Scratch Marks* by James Smith**

Why do I believe that is some sort of man! What “else” could it be, and who else will it be? Although, a bit bowed at the knee. Yes, it’s still a striking figure, with, of all things, flourescent hair, spikey too! Orange skin?! Oh my! Now I’m afraid I’ve seen it all. I do believe that it could be a recently descended alien species, of obvious unknown origin. Well, step too close, and in too aggressive a manner and you will experience the “teeth” which gives identity to this rather common Earth species with long snout and perpetually wet and sensitive nose, long sloppy tongue as well. Umm, I detect a series of internal rumbles likely to lead to a sustained eruption of barks. I think it is best that at this time I must run, might be in my best interest to do so! Although, short of stature it is, it is much taller than I, with powerful appearances. Hey! It seems about to speak. Is it? No, only seeks to yawn. Also, it appears to exhibit a disdain for those with fur and long tail, and bent close to the ground on spindly legs. It must think me to be significantly off. Harumph! Well, at any rate, my unshod feet are getting appreciably cold, gotta run, keeps up critical circulation - loss of heat can cause hallucinations, you know. See ya! Next time. But, now, I do believe that was only Jim!
