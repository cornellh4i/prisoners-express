**“Tracks” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

Unions wanted money.

Railroads needed tracks.

He said “Build more highways.”

Workers got the ax.

Rabbits in the garden

Left me just their tracks

Sharky wanted money,

Gave me forty whacks.

Pushers want more money.

Needles leave their tracks.

Feds brough guns’n’badges.

I ain’t paid the tax.

Trains no longer rolling.

Weeds have claimed the tracks

Rich folk building prisons

Bread the poor folks backs.
