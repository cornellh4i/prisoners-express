**The Doll Hospital by Catherine LaFleur**

J14175

My sister’s purse smashed into the garage door followed by the tinkling of broken glass make-up and perfume bottles as they spilled out of the open zipper. Paloma stood in the driveway of our 1970s ranch style home screaming curses at Eddie, her latest ex-boyfriend, as he gunned the engine and sped away.

I slipped out of the dark garage and began gathering together her clothes strewn across the white concrete. I was secretly glad she was back. Paloma had wild wavy hair, baked incredible bread, and was an adult, an adult who was not a part of the strict religious community my parents lived in. We shared the same father but different mothers.

I was the baby sister, sixteen years younger than she. Sometimes, people would confuse us for mother and daughter. Sometimes, I wished she really was my mother. No matter how many times I asked for the “truth,” her story never changed. Also, there were massive amounts of pregnancy photos of my mother. Paloma was living with my parents on the day of my birth and had plenty of stories about me.

Paloma drifted in and out of my life, always showing up just when my mother had enough of me. Her mere presence was enough to distract my mother for months. She played endless games of tea parties with me and made hand-made doll clothes. Whenever one of the dolls broke, she would whisk it away to the “Doll Hospital.” I truly thought there was such a place. My sister would encourage me to fill out get-well cards for my toys while they were in the hospital getting better. Meanwhile, she expertly fixed up dangling ears on Bunny, a tattered paw on Bear, and gave my rag doll a new embroidered face.

Paloma earned her money as a beautician at the Styles of Magic Hair Salon in town. The name alone was enough to spin my parents into a religious fury. One of the best treats for me was being allowed to go to the salon during summer vacation when school was out. Otherwise, I would be stuck in the garden or have to be in religious education all day because both of my parents worked.

My favorite activity at the salon was going through Palom’s purse. I would spread out all of the pictures in her wallet and name each person: myself, mom, and dad, Paloma’s other brothers and sisters, Patrice, Jean, and Michel. I would also investigate her make-up, testing the colors on the side of my hand. My favorite object of all was a pink plastic compact shaped like a daisy with a mirror on the inside.

The day Eddie returned to Paloma, the compact was smashed along with other things. I gazed at the broken flower with shard of glass glittering all around it. Paloma put her hand around my shoulders and told me not to worry about it. She and I would go shopping for a replacement at the flea market that weekend. Eventually, I grew out of sending my dolls to the hospital.

At a time, I was housed in a large prison complex in the north part of the state. The women there kept mostly to themselves. There was a lockdown unit, a psychiatric unit, and most importantly, death row. Three women had made it off the row and were commuted to life without parole sentences.

One of them was Winnie. She allegedly stabbed herself repeatedly with pens and pencils, making a gangrenous mess of her leg, which had to be amputated. Legend has it that this act saved her from death row because at the time, the law required you to be able to walk to the chair under your own power. Whether or not this is true, Winnie was confined to a wheelchair.

Prison is a harsh place and there are plenty of mean girls here. People get shattered by the prison experience. Winnie was involved in a notorious case involving several deaths of children. She was also diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder. Who knows if that is true, but she certainly had emotional and mental problems. At some point, one of the women had made Winnie a doll.

Winnie treated it like her real child, dressing it, rocking it, feeding it. The toy seemed to give her comfort. She would ride it around in the back pocket of her wheelchair. One day, a few young girls decided it would be fun to steal Winnie’s doll. However, they didn’t just steal the doll. They ripped it’s head off, pulled out the stuffing, and threw it in the handicapped shower where Winnie would be sure to find it. The doll was utterly shattered. They hoped Winnie would be too.

Winnie didn’t find it. I did, while I was cleaning the shower. I immediately knew who the doll belonged to. So I took it to my cell, thinking, I guess, maybe I could repair it. I had a lot of hobby craft supplies. One of the great things about being in a two person cell is that you can shut the door and work on projects. I pick out all the stitches and cut out a new doll body. Then over the course of three weeks, I had sewn a new doll for Winnie, trying to make it as close to the original as possible.

When I was done, I walked up behind Winnie and dropped the doll into the back pocket of the wheelchair. I said nothing to her and she did not notice what I had done. The next day, I saw Winnie cradling the new doll and crooning a lullaby.

Sometimes the mirror is shattered but its shards still show pieces of the truth.
