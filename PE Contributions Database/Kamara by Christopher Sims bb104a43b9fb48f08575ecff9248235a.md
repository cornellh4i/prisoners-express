**Kamara by Christopher Sims**

Our children grow up so fast. She was only one when her father, Chris, was incarcerated. Fifteen years later, she is now a grown woman in the eyes of some men. At only sixteen, she has physically mature years beyond her wild, Her body receives attention only women get harassed about. Her mind is a poison from the reality ratchetness on TV and Instagram models on her phone. With all the attention she receives, she is quick to lose her virginity to a guy much older than her. Thirsty for love and temporary pleasure, she enjoys the fact that an older guy has shown her attention and made her feel like never before. She soon drops out of school and runs away from home because her mother doesn’t understand her and her father is still incarcerated. Eventually she gets pregnant by her much older boyfriend that denies her and her baby. Due to the expensive care of a child that she can’t take care of, she is forced to have an abortion. Soon after, she finds herself half naked on a pole in a strip club dancing. Kamara is now getting money and attention she craved for, that her father was never able to give her.
