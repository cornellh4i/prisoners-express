**“A Close Call” by Al Coleman** 

I was nine or ten years old. My family was staying at my aunt’s house in Cocoa Beach, Florida, for some kind of miniature family reunion. We didn’t get to see my cousins that often because they lived in North Carolina and we lived in Florida, so my brother and I were having a great time playing with them. We were also allowed to stay up past our bedtime, which was a rare treat. I took full advantage of this privilege, staying up until very late talking to my older cousin, even though I was exhausted by the day’s activities.

I remember being told that there was a special surprise that next day, but these surprises were not usually that special so I didn't spend much time speculating on it. Probably just pancakes for breakfast or something, I thought.

The next morning, though the underwater haze of half-consciousness, I hear my dad bark “Get up if you are going to eat breakfast” or something to that effect. It was like was like five in the morning, pitch black outside, and of course I was groggy from staying up so late the night before. Definitely more tired than hungry, I listened to the others eating breakfast down the hall as I floated back to slumberland.

A little while later - maybe minutes, maybe an hour - I hear my dad’s harsh voice telling someone to “leave him be - his worthless ass is still in bed,” loud enough so he could be sure I heard it. There was no one in the world who could put more contempt or disappointment into the word “worthless” than my father.

A few minutes later, I heard him say loudly, “Forget it - he is too lazy to even go to Disney World.” I remember thinking what a transparent ploy this was to trick me into getting up for breakfast I didn't even want. I tossed and turned a little bit before finally looking in my bag for some clothes to slip on. I was moving very slowly - it was still dark outside, for crying out loud - who eats breakfast this early?!

Gradually, I noticed that all of the voices and bustle that I had been hearing had disappeared, replaced by an eerie silence. And that’s when it hit me - the special surprise the adults were hinting at the night before. Could it actually be…

I tore down the hallway half -dressed with my shoes in my hand. There was no one in the dining room, the kitchen, or the living room. My stomach dropped. Right then, the front door opened and one of my aunts and my mom walked in.

“Where is everyone?” I asked, my voice trembling in fear.

“THey just left. They are going to Disney World,” my mom answered with a hint of pity. I didn't believe her. I couldn't believe her. I ran past her to the driveway that was full of cars the night before. There was only one car left. Right there, as the sun had just begun to rise, I fell to the concrete and sobbed.

I spent the longest day of my life stuck in the house nearly alone. I couldn't believe anyone could be so cruel, taking all of the kids but me. Yes, I didn't get up immediately, but I didn't think Disney was a real possibility. We had only been once before, and I don't think my parents liked Disney. We didn't have a lot of money as well, so I couldn't take the prospect seriously. I was so disappointed.

I remember when everyone got back that night, laden with souvenirs and stories of Space Mountain. My dad looked at me and said, “I guess you will do what I tell you next time.” to him, this was an important life lesson. And it was. But i don't want to think I learned the lesson he wanted me to. As you can tell I have thought about this a lot since then. On one hand, I see how spoiled I was. No one is entitled to go to Disney World. But on the other, I just see what feels like cruelty and unfairness. I think maybe both could be true.
