**“I Came, I Saw I Surrendered” by Vaughn Wright**

When the four of us stepped out of the woods onto the snow-covered bank of a half-frozen creek, I took one look at what lay off in the distance and that was it for me.

“Ye-a-ah,” I drawled, “I’m gonna be takin’ a pass on this one, guys.”

More than mildly upset, Steev Wills, the coordinator of our little excursion, said, “Are you kidding me right now, Omar? We drive eighty miles from the city, hike through the woods until we almost get to where we’re goin’ and you’re calling quits on us?”

We all worked for the Department of Sanitation, but it was Steev’s bright idea for the four of us to use the holiday weekend to get some fresh air. Since he was the only one of us who claimed to actually know anything about the outdoors, we trusted him to rent the cabin, tell us how to properly get outfitted, and so forth. And what with me and him both being black, he probably expected more solidarity from me than Joe, a white guy, or Bert, a Latino. Only I wasn’t feeling especially allegiant just them.

I took my hands off the straps of my backpack to gesture apologetically, and said, “Hey, I’m sorry, all right? I thought I could do it, only now I’m looking at that mountain and all the forest we gotta cross to get to it, and I’m thinking that’s more nature than I need in my life right now.”

To be honest, I don’t think I was ever as fully committed to the outing as I had led Steev and the others to believe. “Roughing it,” as in purposely denying myself broadband and GrubHub delivery for a whole three days, held about as much appeal to me as hitting myself in the head with a hammer.

“Come on, O,” Roberto “Bert” Perez enetreated. “Like Steev said, we’re almost there. Stick it out with us, *hermano*.”

“Are you not seeing what I’m seeing, Bert?

It was beautiful out there, without a doubt. But everything was so … intimidating. Reaching right up into the underbelly of the clouds were massive stone shards of the earth itself. Even though we were still miles from it, that range of mountains was so ginormous I didn’t doubt i t had its own gravitational field. Our cabin was at the foot of that?

Between us and there, and beyond, the forest was an ocean of evergreen skyscrapers, a home to hordes of wild creatures that could fly and stalk and pounce with talons or claws or fangs. Google listed all the animals that were out there, but the only ones that I could remember were bears and cougars. They killed people. The others would eat whatever was left over. I’d been feeling hungry eyes on me ever since we first arrived.

And what about that sky? Overcast with cotton batting of purple and grey from horizon to horizon, keeping everything beneath it cold and damp. Every once in a while the wind blew a chill clean through me, every time convincing me one night without heat would be all it took to become an ice-cold corpse by morning.

Even that little stream. It probably started wa-a-ay up in those mountains somewhere, and was just itching to drown us all as soon as it could gather up enough snow melt to become a raging river.

It was Nature and it was not safe. This was what cities came from? It seemed impossible. I saw nothing tamable there. Nothing. The place literally been scaring the shit out of me from the minute we got there, because I’d been wanting to take a deuce since I climbed out of my car. And I was supposed to drop said deuce out here, how again?

“Look, I can’t speak for anybody else,” I explained, “but me, I came from a long line of city people. The last time somebody in my family saw something like that,” I waved a hand towards the view before us, “they probably wanted to know how much further it was to freedom.”

Steev said, “You mean to tell me, even after all that money you spent on gear and supplies, you’re really not gonna go through with it?”

I shook my head. “I’m really not.”

Steev said, “Well, if that’s how you feel, you can find your own way back okay, can’t you?”

If that sounded like anything other than him hoping I feel down an unmarked well on my way back to the cars, it wasn’t.

“No prob,” I assured him. “I’m good.”

“Then I guess we’ll see you at work Tuesday morning.”

I watched my friends skirt the creek’s edge on their way toward that majestic purple rock in the distance. No one turned around to catch my salute. It wasn’t for them anyways.
