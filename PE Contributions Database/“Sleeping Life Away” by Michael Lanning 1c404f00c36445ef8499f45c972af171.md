**“Sleeping Life Away” by Michael Lanning**

He’d always been good at filling empty time, entertaining himself while he waited. And most of life, he had concluded, was about waiting. Waiting for the class period to end, the school day to finish, the game to be over. Waiting for a ride, waiting to grow up, to be old enough. Waiting to be done with whatever boring thing he was doing at the moment.

For getting rid of boring, empty, useless, depressing time, there was nothing so good as sleep. Jump ahead, fast-forward, get on with the plot such as it was. Even the animals knew this.

Sleep is an escape from life. When I am asleep I am free. Please let me sleep forever.
