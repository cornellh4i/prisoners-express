**“Sisters” by John Balistreri**

****I’ve watched them grow. Rarely did I ever see one without the other. Rarely were they not enjoying each other’s company. Only a couple years apart, they share the same friends and are not separated by any discernible age gap. They are the best of friends, even in the worst of times. They are my nieces. They are my sisters.

Before the youngest of the two, Shyanne, was born, Kaylie was my little buddy. She and I would pal around everywhere together. She was such a precious little thing. When her sister was born, it wasn’t as if we had lost that bond. In fact it was, as if, it had only grown. A bond large enough to encompass the three of us.

As they grew older I wasn’t always able to be there to watch. However, no matter the distance or amount of time spent away from them, our bond never grew weak. If anything it was strengthened. And when, after years of being away, I came back into their lives, I found I was still their buddy--and their favorite uncle. More so than almost anything I’d experienced, this fills me with joy.

And now here I sit. Separated from them once again. This time perhaps indefinitely. I stare teary-eyed at the latest picture that my sister has sent me. I wonder if they still feel the same about me. Am I still their favorite uncle?

In my heart they are my favorite pair. This pair of sisters.
