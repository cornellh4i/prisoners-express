**“When There’s No Other Choice” by Nate A. Lindell**

Prisoncrats and the likes of Attorney General Jeff Sessions flippantly justify their callous treatment of criminals (i.e. poor people caught breaking one or more of their-noto our- thousands of laws) by concluding “they chose to break the law”. Our “choice” is used to justify years of degradation plotted out to the finest detail.

There is no such thing as “choice”. We all do what we think, at the time of the “choice”, is the wisest, most brilliant thing to do at the time, given the state of our mind (e.g. values, mood, etc.) at the time. Sometimes we think the best thing to do is something we also know is stupid, depending on what part of our mind wins the tug of war for the whole of their person.

This lack of choice isn’t always apparent, and those indoctrinated to believe in ‘free will”, especially as part of a religion, have been blinded from considering such a possibility.

However, sometimes a criminal’s lack of choice is obvious, produced by the very sainted people entrusted with punishing us sinners. In 2015, I was in Terre Haute U.S.P., reaching the end of my exile from the W.I. prison system, which kicked me out for assaulting, suing and posting articles on my blog (Prometheus Writes!) because and about prisoncrats’ abuse. The S.H.U. Lieutenant there, D. Sherman didn’t like what I’d done in W.I., and promised my 6’ 3”, 380= pound cellie a “sweet transfer” if I died in our cell, assuring that three-toothed poly addict chunk of White trash that I wasn’t in prison for murder and was a “pussy”.

Having smoked, snorted and shot away most of his brain cells, that cellie told me about Sherman’s offer, then began feeling me out, making threats, even pushing me to do drugs with him (I refused.) I had no choice of moving into another cell; obviously Sherman would not undermine his own plan. Besides, guards were falsely telling other prisoners that I was “snitching” on prisoners “and staff”.

My left knee was out of action and seveerly painful from an attack via a prisoner, from behind, while I was in a chair, in G.P. When that cellie’s threats and insults reached the extreme, I feigned submission- “Hey, you’re right, I’m a bitch, I’m sorry.” I let him go to sleep, keeping my cool, keeping calm.

Then I calmly wrapped some string around a razor, planned my move, practiced it, then calmly did it. If his neck hadn’t been so fat, his arteries would’ve been severed, just another suicide. But, when I saw no spray, I lept into his bunk, onto his chest, and clamly slashed his face, slashed the wrist of a hand that tried to hold mine, straightened the bone-bent blade three times, and kept slashing while he pleaded for me to let him up before he bled out.

Keeping calm, I realized his arteries had all escaped my slices, that his body had at least...14 pints of blood, only a quarter of a pint running free-it’d take maybe an hour for him to bleed out, and I’d already failed to make it look like a suicide. So, I let him up to go to the door and cry out for help.

Situations like that, sometimes blatantly created by prisoncrats, are inescapable, inevitable in the houses of rehabilitation created, filled with condoned by good men such as Jeff Sessions and Mike Pence. To not keep calm makes no sense. To get highly emotional will help none, only cloud your thinking and actions.

When one keeps calm, however, in such a situation, prisoncrat’s pet psychologists inevitably cite that as a symptom of one being a psychopath, a hypocritical diagnosis: they get pissed that their devious efforts to torment/punish you fail to produce the visible misery they so hoped for.

Russians are known for stoically enduring their ever-oppressive governments. The Brits, too, are known for their stiff upper lips. C’est la vie, the French say. C’est la morte, I say. But I didn’t c’est it.
