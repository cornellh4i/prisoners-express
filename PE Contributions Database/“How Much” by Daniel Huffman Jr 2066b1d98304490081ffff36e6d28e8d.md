**“How Much” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

When I was a lad, my Mother would ask “How much do you love me?”

My reply was “Let me see.” I’d hold my hands about a foot apart and “This much” I’d say.

Then I got older and my Mother took me to church one day.

I saw Jesus on the cross and I asked “Did he do something mean?”

“No” she said and she read to me John 3:16.

Then she asked “Do you understand?”

I said “Just look how far apart He has His hands.”

My Mother said “Yes, I see.”

I said, “That is how much He loves me”
