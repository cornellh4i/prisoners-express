**“Jam Out” by Delvin Diles**

Twenty years have gone by since I left the world but whenever I hear Cameo declare in his trademark nasal falsetto, “You put on your airs / and act real cool / but you got to realize / that you’re acting like fools,” I’m right back in a breezeway, 1986, playing with my Optimus Prime Transformer (the jumbo-sized, all-white, resurrected Prime from the movie my coked-up step-dad took me to see); or Keith Sweat whine “Didn’t I giiive you / eevverythaaang / you e-ever waa-anted girl?” I’m in the passenger seat of Aunt Doris’ money green Grand Prix with the fuzzy dice hanging from the mirror, watching the equalizer lights pulsate with the beat; or Jodeci croon “Sorry I left you / Left you cry-ying,” I’m trying to figure out why the side-switch lever on the walkman I stole from Target never stays in place for more than a few seconds if you use it partway through the tape; or Bizzy Bone spittin’ rapid fire… something I only understand while blunted but could never recite. That’s cool. The notes and beats never fail to transport me through the walls of space-time, right back home.
