**"Road Trips" by Carl Branson**

It was about six months since the yard optometrist wrote a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam and treatment protocol for suspected glaucoma.

Therefore, I was both thrilled and anxious when the Graveyard Shift CD woke me at four in the morning to inform me that I was to get ready for a medical transport. Since it was midsummer, the eastern sky was tinged pink as I turned out for the five o’clock “early chow” call.

Surprisingly enough, the nine passenger ford van was on time for the scheduled six in the morning departure. A fellow felon and I climbed aboard after being shackled and hobbled. A short stop at a neighboring yard made it a threesome.

After a decade of nothing but walking speed between destinations on the yard, cruising the rural roads of central Arizona at thirty to forty-five miles per hour felt like we were flying. As we left the drab gray buildings of the many yards making up the prison complex, the surrounding basements of the native desert landscape gave way to the hand of man. Vast fields of green crops spread out from both sides of the road and were crisscrossed by irrigation channels. Between the size and shape of the plants and the van’s speed, it was impossible to identify what was growing - the only thing I knew for sure was that it was not corn. Periodically, the fields would yield to groups of residential structures - maybe a dozen or so - ranging from mobile homes to the occasional stucco coated ranch house. All too often these communities had the sad look of neglect and poverty.

The scene changed rather abruptly to sprawling business and light industrial parks with the attendant fast food franchises on every other corner. Strip malls and tracts of planned housing developments marked the outskirts of Casa Grande, our destination city.

The doctor’s office was another surprise. Rather than some one-house private operation, it was an elaborate corporate assembly line set up with at least twenty-four eye specialists on staff. Photos of each doctor were posted in the entry foyer. My eye exam, I believe, was carried out efficiently over the course of an hour as I was moved from station to station without delay, including a digital photo of my retina.

Being exposed to the hustle and bustle of contemporary city life gave me a new appreciation for the easy-going, laid back environment that exists in our yard. It also made me realize exactly how lazy I’ve become while in prison. But, by the same token, I have concluded that I would prefer the pressure of deadlines, performance standards, and other tensions of modern life on the other side of the razor wire.
