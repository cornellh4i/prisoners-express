**"Road Trip" by James Bauhaus**

I saw this shit on the news, all the way to Albuquerque, where I was making a few bucks ghostwriting papers for lazy university students. The pigs had surrounded my friends in their home in rural Kansas, burned the house down, then murdered him as he tried to escape the flames on his Kawasaki. He was trying to lead them away from his wife, but all that tear gas slowed him down enough for their bullets to cash him. They found Sharon in the secret shelter below the basement when she couldn’t keep the baby quiet. She and her family hid there for three days, but the pigs just would not leave. They stole all his vettes, cobras and thunderbirds, sold all his stud horses, shot his dogs and spent days carrying off all the expensive goodies that they found in his recording studio. Digging through the house, they hoped to find jewelry but heard the cries of her sick baby instead. The pigs hired a crew to jackhammer through the floor, and then they stole her whole family and sent her to jail.

I wrote to her mom, offering my condolences. She only knew me as a friend of Sharon’s fresh from college, not the prison escapee I was. She forwarded my sentiments to Sharon. A couple of weeks later, her mother sent me a note from Sharon, along with a much longer one from her. Margie had managed to wrestle her grandchildren back from the pigs, but now she – all of them – needed help, badly, and lots of it, especially since the pigs had stolen and frozen all of their bank accounts. Would I help?

It was a miserable drive over there – 13 hours of eating bugs on the only transportation I had: an old Yamaha dirt bike that was geared too low from sustained highway speeds. I put in colder spark plugs and timed my arrival to occur after midnight. It was four AM when I got as close to the meth house as I dared. Hiding the bike in a ditch full of chest-high hemp plants, I snuck through half a mile of cornfields before getting in range. The corn was tall and robust, with sharp leaves, but plenty of room between rows to walk through. My olive drab army surplus shirt would help me remain invisible after sunup as I sat with my monocular and can of bug spray, watching the burned-out hulk from the edge of the neighbors’ cornfield, five hundred yards away. No cops drove out of there at dawn; none drove in to hide behind it before dawn either. Around two in the afternoon, a county deputy pulled in, poked around like a jackal for half an hour, then drove out, apparently disappointed. A friendly dog found me, but I didn’t feed it or let it carry off any of my garbage. It got bored after a while and went back to hunting rabbits. A few cars and trucks went by: none stopped. It got dark and late again. I napped. The alarm on my watch woke me. I washed down a bit of powder with the last of my canteen water and began hiking the last 800 yards. I was filthy and sticky, but my mind was beginning to rev up again when I got to the horse barn. I hooked a 250-foot tape to a nail in the base of the shade tree and paid out 110 feet. I hooked my other tape to a bolt sticking out of the base of the water trough, then paid out 75 feet. Where the two tapes crossed, the dirt was very soft and powdery, having been churched by horse hooves for decades. It made easy digging with my entrenching tool. One foot down, I hit the plastic cap of a fat cylinder. Five minutes later, I had dirt pulled away from the neck, the cap off, and was piling the contents into my backpack. Just as important as getting the money was leaving no trace of my visit. Your regular numbskull criminal would have left the hole open along with a “fuck you” note for the pigs. Not me: Sherlock Holmes couldn’t get a clue from the way I left things. Cops get nothing from me.

Two hours later, I had retrieved my bike, called Margie, and managed to avoid all the cops between the burned-out farmhouse they’d stolen and the rest stop along the interstate that led out of that windblown pesthole. I’d just finished taking a birdbath in the restroom when Margie drove up in her station wagon. It was still very early, but she had woken the kids and had them bring their pajamas. They slept in back while I dumped my pack out on to the floorboards. The bricks of cash tumbled into the feeble light, followed by a bag of powder.

“Jesus!” Margie exclaimed, then pardoned herself and did the sign of the cross. While she picked up a brick and examined it, I examined her. She looked just like Sharon, only older, with a more modest taste in clothes and sensibly short hair. “These are all hundreds? My oh my!” She managed to sound worried and gratified at the same time. “That white bag? Is that…?”

“Yes,” I continued.

“Throw it away!”

“I’ll take care of it.” It looked to be about four ounces, worth about $20,000 if a guy tried to retail it. If all the bricks were hundreds, as I suspected they were, then this was worth about half a million dollars. There was no excuse for it, and I’d expected more of John, at least until I saw the pigs on the news, hauling off his estate cars. *What a waste!* I told her my estimate of the total. She gasped. “So, what’s your plan?” I asked, knowing that it would be a bad one.

“Why, to get my daughter out of that awful place right away!”

This poor woman should have known better, but she’d been hamstrung by the church crowd, who all thought that God made the plans for them. This is like driving with your eyes closed. Soon as she tried to pay Sharon’s bond, the courthouse crew would smell the money, kidnap her into their jail and browbeat it all out of her in only a few hours, if that. And she’d tell them about me, too. It would have been better for everyone if I stayed. I’d have to mortgage her house, build at least two stashes for the money, explain to her how the judicial system really works, get Sharon out, find out who was the real fix-it lawyer, get the laundry operation going…

“Margie?” I began.

“Yes?”

“It’s going to be a little harder than that.”

“I can’t leave her in there! What else can I do?”

I offered to stay and help and Margie gratefully accepted, even though she barely knew my name. We moved the kids into the back seat to make room for my bike. We made it inside her garage while it was still dark, without any cops seeming to notice. It was almost a month before I could get back to Albuquerque. The return trip wasn’t nearly as taxing. The bike sat on the bumper of a Ford van that had been made for comfortable road trips.

The sweltering California summer heat was overwhelming as a gracefully aging Chevrolet drove us to the cool pacific ocean. Our little family of four had made this trip many times, but this trip would be the best and most memorable for me.

We took the familiar back-highway route, a secret known only to valley residences, or so we like to tell ourselves. These back-highways, encroached by dirt, zig-zag through thousands of acres of farmland irrigated by the California water canal system that runs parallel to miles of the highway.

We were more than halfway to our destination. The low rolling, sunburnt hills of the valley were mostly in the rearview mirror and we had just passed a large green sign announcing that we had entered a new city. However, after some time the old Chevrolet gave up the “ghost”, or in the mechanic’s jargon, “threw a main bearing.”

Living in the age of cellular communication does, on occasion, show its superiority as it did that day. My wife of seven years called for a tow while I informed the two wild animals, who carried a combination of my wife and I’s genes, that the beach trip might not happen. Needless to say, they were not happy about the development. My girl, who unfortunately for her, carries a striking resemblance to me, somehow developed the same look on her face as when she is waiting for the punchline of a joke. At only six-years-old going on sixteen, she could be more than slightly intimidating. On the other hand, my son, at the ripe old age of four, just wanted to play video games and didn't care where.

The ride in the tow truck was rough and slow. We were on smooth asphalt, but by the way the truck shook and lurched, we could have been on a dirt road peppered with potholes. The kids loved it.

The tow driver was a cordial and chatty fellow in beat-up coveralls with a Santa Claus type of stomach that pushed the limits of his buttons. We finally arrived in a nameless and forgettable little town composed of eight buildings, with the newest being a Chevron gas station. At last, he dropped us off at a motel.

After a brief encounter with the motel desk clerk with the Norman Bates vibe, we found ourselves in a basic room. The amenities included four walls and a heavy duty door with multiple locks. Nothing more. The television had two and a half channels, no cable or internet service.

That night we were all huddled together, simply talking and sharing stories of mostly the fictional sort. My wife and I talked to the kids about our childhood and that segwayed into card games of Go Fish, Old Maid and original games of our own. We laughed and talked well into the night. No computers, phones, internet or games. Just the four of us spending time together, much like the way my wife and I had spent with our parents at that age. It was the best vacation ever.
