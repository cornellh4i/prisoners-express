**“Strength of the Wolf” by James Cepak**

The strength of the wolf is the pack;

The strength of the pack is the wolf.

Hunting together makes all one,

One will become all or else be done.

We smell and seek meat,

We design to feed

Hunt to kill, kill to keep

Rise like tides, full bellies bring sleep

We, as a pack, arise to challenge

Foes and prey each the same.

Scouts and strength are a leaders’ edge.

The leader follows the pack to guide.

If one is in front by him the pack hides.

Stealth is strength, one and many are driven

By hunger, needs come together for life given.

The strength of the wolf is the pack.

Though one stands out he can’t

Think too hard or keep looking back.

The strength of the pack is the wolf.

Each is one as one is all;

Family together as truly loyal lives are full.

-James Cepak
