***Leap Year Swarms: A Trilogy Story* by Martin West**

*First Outbreak: North America, February 29, 2016*

A massive meteorite fallout cloud appeared simultaneously in four major U.S. cities: Wichita, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, and Lincoln.

According to biohazard scientists, the cause of the fallout formation cloud was the aftermath of four equal meteorite matter parts landing within hours of each other. All four states requested federal funding to activate all military reserve forces to address the outbreaks, mass panic and hysteria, and the biological and atmospheric changes occurring within a 90 mile radius of the meteorite's landing sites.

Bird watchers notified their local park and forestry services to report a new hybrid bird and the disappearance of all blue jays and cardinals. In its place, all male species of blue jays and cardinals had a bright, cardinal red body with blue jay blue wing and tail feathers. The female birds, however, had a light-colored blue jay body with pale cardinal red wing and tail feathers. Both hybrids chirped cardinal and blue jay melodies. Interestingly, no other birds seem to have been affected.

All farming in these four major cities reported to their extension units that since the fallout cloud appeared, a light dew mist caused a rapid growth spurt for alfalfa, corn, milo, soybeans, and wheat. What normally took 3 months to grow then took 3 weeks to achieve the same growth.

Meteorologists were baffled at how the fallout cloud would cause their cities to go into early spring-summer climates. Lincoln news reports cautioned its citizens not to handle or try to catch the acid producing earthworms and caterpillars coming out of the meteorite egg like sack spores. Lincoln also had to educate its residents to wear dust facemasks whenever outdoors because their cloud also contained noxious fumes during the hottest part of the day.

Similarly, Wichita faced regular ants’ becoming giant fire ants and brown recluses becoming as large as six inch hairy tarantulas within a 30 mile radius or the meteorite landing site. The city also faced a 30% increase in pollination spores: mold, mildew and ragweed were at their highest of the past 9 years.

Moreover, Kansas City ran flash flood warnings within a 30 mile radius of its meteorite site landing. It rained everyday for the past 21 days, and schools used snowdays for closing due to both water damage and neighborhood flooding zones, making school unsafe to open.

Oklahoma City reported that its landing site was turned into a 9 mile marsh swampland with all mold spores hatching water moccasins rattlesnakes 9 inches long and 1.5 inches thick with the ability to spit spray if felt threatened. Many homeowners called herpetologist hotlines to seek help in excavating these hybrid snakes from their garages, storage sheds, ponds, pools, and livestock water tanks and feed bins. These snakes had red eyes and muddy brown and black marbling patterns on its back.

New strict guidelines had to be enforced by military personnel:

1. No citizen within a 30 mile meteorite landing site radius could travel outside its home zone of 15 miles.
2. No exporting any merchandise from any businesses within the 4 major cities until each load was cleared safe from Outbreak hazards.
3. No incoming tourism allowed by bus, car, plane or train to the landing site cities for 60 days. Effective March 1, 2016.

Would you have panicked not being able to travel freely? Would you have tried to catch a specimen in spite of warnings not to go near them?

*Second Outbreak: Amazon Rainforest, South America, February 29, 2020*

Personal Delivery: You are handed one wire gram sheet with the following instructions: You have 6 hours to pack and purchase all supplies needed to become a USA Today Special Correspondent to document the Meteorite Phenomenon Outbreak: The Amazon Rainforest. Then, once you supply the proper credentials, you are then given an American Express card values at $900, a roundtrip airline ticket to Brazil, a valid passport with your information, and a boarding pass for a helicopter. Be at your local county courthouse parking lot between 6PM and 6:30PM for your commuter flight to catch your redeye to Brazil. You will be provided further details of your mission during the first flight.

Do you accept this challenge? Are you ready with supplies and luggage at the pick up site? Or do you decline and return the items given to you?

“Congratulations, my name is Randy Sparks. I’m your helicopter pilot, and my co-pilot is Leah Cremesmith. Your sponsor research specialist is Ivar Dalripple. I’m glad to see you arrived 15 minutes early with everything to be loaded. May I see your passport ID and boarding pass, please? Please buckle in everyone. We are ready for takeoff.”

After take off, you are given a laptop and the homepage tells you to right click to learn about The Rainforest Phenomenon. Every living plant has reproduced to catastrophic proportions, and your team of 9 members must develop and document how to control meteorite cloud formation side effects to prevent vegetation strangulation.

*Third Outbreak: Africa, February 29, 2024*

Almost overnight, a dense fog appeared over the African Plains, creating an illusion of ultraviolet hues and sound lulling waves which caused all air and life to be sleep induced from 6am to midnight. This sleeping pattern stayed in effect until March 21, 2024. There was no sun or stars in the sky. The only light source was the rising Crescent moon from midnight to 6AM. How would these conditions have affected all ecosystems?
