**Flying by Ronald Lark**	

Flying...I’m a Lark, I’ve always been meant to fly, whether literally or metaphorically. It’s in my blood.

Okay, so I haven’t actually flown anything myself, but I’ve been a passenger, and loved it. LOL!!!!

It would have been awesome to have learned to fly a plane, but I’d always been without the direction and means that would’ve led me there. However, I was given experiences of actual flight, in a sense, throughout my life.

Yeah, I know we’re not supposed to write about anything that isn’t true, and I know that dreams aren’t considered true accounts, but I tend to have some very realistic dreams. As real as my writing of what you are reading. So, bear with me and let me tell you about a few experiences of flying that I was given, through dreams. Enjoy! LOL!!!

My very first dream of flying was when I was a small child of around 5 years of age. It began with me standing on the top of the highest mountain around. In real life I really enjoyed jumping off the edge of hills to see how far I could jump, so, naturally, the idea sparked within the dream.

I made sure to get a good running start, and I jumped out as hard as I could. I didn’t jump as far as I expected to. Instead, I kept going, over other mountains, over forests, over fields and water. I didn’t know what was going on, but, man, it was so cool. LOL!!!

I kept going until I approached a familiar mountain top. The closer that I got to it, the more I descended. Eventually landing right back where I had begun that journey.

Though I had never experienced flying in real life, this dream allowed me the experience of being high above mountains, trees, water, etc...looking down upon them all, while the air hit me in the face, rushing past. Actual flight.

After that such dreams became a common occurrence. I was jumping for long distances, and even actually flying. Oh, yeah, as embarrassing as it is to admit, some of the flying involved me actually flapping my arms. LOL!!! Hey, I’m a Lark, what can I say.

Check this out, though...within the dreams where I would flap my arms to fly, I found that the wind and air had layers that allowed me to raise my arms and place my hands on the highest layers that I could reach, then lift myself up. Each time I did this I would go higher and higher, basically flapping my arms. So, it wasn’t that bad. LOL!!!

Now, out of all of my flying experiences there was one that was out of this world. Literally!

The month before I was locked up I experienced flying like I’d never known. It began with me in my living room, then suddenly being outside, in the middle of the parking lot. From there I started rising into the air, without trying.

I rose higher and higher, not able to stop it. Rising above the apartment complex, my home town, I didn’t know what was going on. I kept rising higher than I’d ever known before, and still kept going, faster the higher I got.

The next thing that I knew, I was actually leaving the Earth’s atmosphere, leaving Earth. I past by the moon, by other planets, and still kept going. Needless to say, the situation had me a bit concerned, but the view was spectacular.

I then noticed something that I wasn’t expecting. I was coming up on what seemed to be the end of space as we know it, and the beginning of the nothingness, blackness. It was like a wall of separation. Though at that wall was something in the shape of a heart with a curved tip. A seed of sorts, from what it looked like, because the universe seemed to sprout from it. Yet, I was approaching it rapidly.

Once I got to it, I slowed, then passed through to the other side. I then found myself in a chamber or something, where the only light came from the window behind me that I had passed through. Beside me, in front of the window, was a silverish stool, the top in the shape of the heart seed, and upon it there were three buttons. Hoping that the buttons would help me get home, I sat down and pressed one. It worked, I awoke back at home. It’s a shame that I can’t do that now. LOL!!!

Anyway, that’s some of my experiences with flying. I hope you enjoyed them. LOL!!!
