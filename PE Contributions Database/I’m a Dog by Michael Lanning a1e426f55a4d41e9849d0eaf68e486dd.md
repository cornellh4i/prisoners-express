***I’m a Dog* by Michael Lanning**

Whoa, what the hell happened to me? I’m covered in fur. I’ve got four legs. I’ve got a tail. I’ve got a tail! Oh my god, I’m a dog. I’m actually a dog. Ok, calm down. What do I do? Think, Michael, think. Chase my tail, chase my tail. NO dammit! Let me see. It looks like the world is still normal. I don’t think the rapture has occurred, that the saved have been taken straight to heaven. I never really believed in all that Christianity stuff, even though I knew all about it. I remember telling everyone I’m Buddhist. I believe in karma and reincarnation. Figured I’d come back as a red-eye tree-frog in a marijuana patch since I enjoyed getting high so much, and well, my eyes were constantly red. That must be it, I’m trippin. I got ahold of some good medical grade pot. Yet I don’t feel stoned. I feel fine, for a dog that is. See, my tail’s waggin. Chase my tail, chase my tail. Dammit, stop it! My god, I’m a dog. What cruel irony. Sure, I was told by everyone what a dog I was. I cheated on my wife with anything that walked. I was a dog to my so-called friends. I was a dog to a lot of people. And now I’m literally a dog. Wow! Bow-wow-wow, Bow-wow-wow. Oh shit. God, what do I do? Sniff-sniff. Hey what’s that I smell, sniff-sniff. Grrrrr dog in heat, gotta go. Yeah, I’m a dog.
