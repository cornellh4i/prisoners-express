**“An Ongoing Battle” by Brian Lowe**

Keeping calm, this is probably one of the greatest skills anyone can learn in this life. This concept is important, yet so intricately complex to implement. All people face incidents and situations that challenge their sense of calm. The key is to face these challenges still not let them pierce your calm. This is where it gets complex, because everyone has ways of dealing with interruptions to their calm, but the same techniques do not work for everyone, and can even become counterproductive to others. As with anything that includes a human element, it must be remembered that people are individuals, all different and unique.

The largest threat to my calm is dealing with people that abuse their positions. One outstanding example of this that I can give from personal experience is the behavior of a sergeant here in the Food Service department. She is ignorant, loud, obnoxious, and domineering. She has so many emotional complexes towards men and prisoners, that she thinks that she is “qualified” to be in a managerial position within a men’s prison.

However, in truth she only uses the position to take out her frustration on a literally captive audience. Even worse, she has gathered a “posse” or “fanclub” of inmates following her around telling her how great she is and as long as they kiss up and take her crap, she bestows “favors” upon them. Her crew is the worst thieves in the kitchen, and since they are her crew, she “pulls” their disciplinary cases and encourages their negative behavior.

This threatens my calm because all I want to do is my job and be left alone, but her crew is so busy stealing and getting in the way, that they bar other people’s jobs from getting done. You can’t clean the restrooms if they are stashing sandwiches in and around the toilets (yes, in the toilets). Then it’s my fault my job isn’t done, not theirs, because they have the area blocked off to protect their merchandise, and since I just want to be left alone to do my job, I am not part of her [sergeant of Food Service dept] crew.

This is the ultimate sin in her eyes, so I am a constant target of her harassment. Being cussed out and having my freedom threatened with a disciplinary case is coupled with her guarantee that any case she writes goes “platinum” and will have the worst possibly grading and punishment, because she knows who runs the cases. When the only offense I am truly guilty of is trying to stay out of trouble and do my job, the incentives to do even that is dulled, if no matter what I do I am going to be punished. I might as well go out with a bang! No, even though I get bitter over this, allowing her to get to me would mean she wins, and that alone is sometimes enough to help me maintain my calm.

However, the main and sole thing that allows me to keep my calm consistently in these situations is to remind myself only I can control myself, that I should not allow a person who does not matter to anyone, least of all her own self, influence me negatively in any way. I just have to do what I am supposed to do and hopefully, if I am patient, I can wait it out. Or even better, she will be caught for the illegal activities she enacts and no one will have to deal with her again.

I believe that everything you do is because of the beliefs that drive your thinking. It is hard to pin down and change those beliefs, but it is not impossible. You have to work at it. Most things that used to upset my calm, over the years, I have taught myself to ignore. If you train your mind to believe something is not worth becoming upset about, then it is not. I know my state of mind is my choice. I still have difficulties, but with the amount of practice I am putting in, I should master it soon enough. No matter what, the goal is keeping calm.
