**“Blink of an Eye” by Tommy Hightower**

Every adult, and most especially prisoners, know exactly how fast life can change. In literally the time it takes to blink your eye; your entire world can change. Some changes are so catastrophic that we may never be the same again. Examples of these in my 60 years of life have been: deaths of children; deaths of close relatives; deaths of close friends; divorces and infidelity of spouses; prison sentence of life; physical/medical devastating turns without warning; backstabbed by trusted friends. Each one of these I could write several chapters on just how life-altering was. How each one is still fresh, even after 50 years.

Depending upon your spiritual constitution; or lack of any emotions; we all recover, eventually, and become wiser and stronger for it. I shall not address those without emotions, stoic, sociopath, as it does not seem germane to us of Prisoner Express, amen? All PE family members show great compassion, sensitivity, empathy. This is for you all!

Our Creator teaches us that life is finite. The spirit is infinite. Our lives are filled with good times and hard times, yet the Creator will not allow you to suffer more than you can bear. That each time we are tested by the fires of adversity, pain, sorrows, we shall come out stronger. Just as metal is tempered by fire to make it stronger, so is it with our spirits. We are tested to see if we lean upon our spiritual self and Creator for the strength to endure and go on. Or do we allow ourselves to melt down, lose it; or worst, blame others and even curse God for allowing our suffering.

I have come to the firm belief/philosophy that life does not really begin until we die. For the spirit is held prisoner by a frail physical body, suffering so much, until that moment of death - when the spirit is freed. To be born anew as part of the eternal heavens. Traveling, instantly, through as many dimensions of space/time as there are stars above. To see wonders unimaginable. To learn wisdom so profound as to stagger all the geniuses ever to exist.

So I focus myself upon these things - and do my best to endure through the catastrophes life throws at me, in the blink of an eye. Of course I’ll cry, mourn over loss. Proper respect demands it of all human beings. I’ll rail against wrongs - curse my dying body for breaking down. For I’m a mere mortal, who has foibles, flaws and emotions same as the 7 billion other living beings on earth. It’s what is done “afterwards” that means the most.

If we all prepare ourselves to endure the tragedies and sufferings we know to expect in the blink of an eye; then we shall recover quickly and be a better human for it. Moreso, if we take the time to just be there for others, even strangers, we sense such losses have consumed them; we will quickly learn how precious such agape love is. Just offer an ear to listen to those who hurt. Offer your own experiences and what you did to overcome the same sorrows. Let me tell you firsthand - our Creator has infused us all with special hormones called endorphins. When we give unselfishly of ourselves to comfort another, we will feel a priceless euphoria from our endorphins which is so much more powerful a euphoria than any/all drugs ever to exist. It’s priceless - it’s free - and it’s a noble addiction to acquire.

Altruism is the center of most religions. Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism, has altruism as the highest level of perfection a soul may attain. These attributes I have barely scratched the surface of above - if you adopt them - will make us all better beings for it. People worthy to be welcomed to the eternal spirit form when we die, and are reborn - released from the physical plane to the spiritual realms.

Wish I had the words to better help you internalize these pearls of wisdom I learned by personal suffering. But I am but a mere human, mortal and flawed as all of you.

The act of trying your best is all the Creator ever asks. So please today, try to share yourself with others. To learn and to teach how to prepare for major tragedies in the blink of an eye shall fall upon us all. Learn to endure with a cheerful heart. With Deepest Agape Love, Respect, Honor, Sincerely Yours, Tommy Hightower
