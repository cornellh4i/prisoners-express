**"Family Reunion" by Mary Collins**

It was a beautiful winter’s day in 1976. The skies were azure blue and the air was cool. Mary had just returned from the hospital with my new baby brother James. He looked like our father with blue eyes, reddish-blond hair, and pale ivory skin. He would also be tall and slender as he grew back. He shared none of Mary’s looks. She was short and wide in stature, had raven black hair, dark brown eyes, and olive-toned skin.

We lived in a brand-new house located in Zephyrhillis. It had two bedrooms, one bathroom, a one-car garage, and a backyard. It was brown and beige stucco and was furnished with the best items that Badcock’s had to offer. Mary hung knick-knack shelves, decorative mirrors, and Pixie paintings on the walls. She had an obsession with burning incense sticks in the living room.

My father took great pride in being a hard worker and a good provider for his family. Having his children made his world complete. Mary resented being saddled down with the responsibility that motherhood brought and reminded me daily that she was forced to go from her father’s house to my father’s house. She said my birth robbed her of having her own life.

When she became pregnant, I had hoped that it would change her outlook on parenthood. I wanted to have a mother as everyone else had in their life. My father worked long hours and was rarely home. Mary amused herself in any way she could find while he was away and her mother was my caretaker in her absence. She was the one who taught me how to cook, clean and does laundry, things a mother teaches her daughter.

When our family and friends departed from welcoming James home, Mary began to beckon me to her bedroom. I was to change his clothes, warm his bottle, feed him, change his diaper, sponge bath his tiny body, slather his wrinkled skin with Johnson’s baby oil and powder his little bottom. I would hold him in my arms and rock him to sleep so as not to disturb her.

In less than 24-hours, I had become James’s constant companion. In less than a week, I had trained myself to wake up for his feedings and had instituted a daily routine to accommodate my duties. My mother had forced me to become his mother at the age of eleven. The truth was that I would never have the mother or the childhood that everyone else did.

James became my son in every sense of the word and the bond that forged between us was strong and unique. I protected him as a lioness would her cubs. I would have given my life for this golden child who had taken my heart. I vowed to be the best mother I could be so he would never know the pain of that empty void.

I watched him change and grow from year to year. I heard his first words and encouraged him to take his first steps. I weaned him from a bottle at bedtime to sipping from a cup and sleeping through the night. I can still remember how excited I felt the first time he got a new tooth coming in and the first quarter the “tooth fairy” left him when he lost his front tooth.

He loved going to school and I was a faithful PTA mom. He was a very smart, funny, and friendly child. He enjoyed playing sports and I attended every game and cheered him on as any proud parent would. I kept a scrapbook to record his many achievements.

When I moved into my own apartment, James lived with me more often than he did at home. I bought his school clothes, supplies and always did my best to keep him up-to-date on the current fads. When I gave birth to my sons, he taught them all about being boys, everything from catching frogs in the rain to peeing in the bushes. He was always a father figure to them.

Ironically, when he was eleven years old, I was arrested and would never live in society with him again. He was a child and yet was the glue that held me together during a time when I thought I would die. As I was sentenced to life in prison, James stood up and vowed to help me come back home. He never once gave up trying to do that and we remained in constant contact.

At fifteen years old, he met Corrie and fell in love. They were married at 18 and had two sons together. On their wedding day, he held a photo of me so I would be with him on his special day. When his first son, Davis, was born, he held my photo against the glass in the nursery window so we could gaze at him together. What an honor it was to become an aunt.

He was an amazing young man who would do anything to help anyone he could. He had a soft spot for children, the elderly, the less fortunate and the animals. He was dedicated to working with The Boys Ranch, YMCA, and Big Brothers and even became a Master Boys Scout. A more gentle soul could ever have been found had they searched the world over.

He was a son, brother, uncle, father to three sons, and stepfather to two sons and two daughters, a hard worker, a loving husband, and a respected member of his community. He was an angel here on earth loaned to us by his creator.

He was called home on December 14th, 2006, and I miss him more than mere words could possibly express. He is still the wind beneath my wings and my life is far more the richer for being blessed with his presence in my life for 30 priceless, memorable years. I anticipate the day I will join him for a family reunion.

RIP James!
