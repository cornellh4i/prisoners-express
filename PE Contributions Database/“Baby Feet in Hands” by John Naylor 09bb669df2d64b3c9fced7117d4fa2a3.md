**“Baby Feet in Hands” by John Naylor**

I’ll never forget how small the little things were at first. And those tiny little toes. They were so small it was a wonder they stayed attached. Like little bird bones or something. I remember being asked by Mom if I wanted to hold him. Jessy, my cousin. The first baby being born. I can remember being asked that question about. I can’t help but remember the burden of responsibility at the thought. What if my back went out? I might drop him. Mom said it wouldn’t and I’d be fine. A small little man, warm unalarmed at being passed around. Now I think of what I’m told. Sitting in prison for 15 years. He’s living his life. He’s a man full grown. Living a family life I hear. Years in prison aren’t something we can get back. We look back and see what could’ve been in our lives. Whether you’re out of prison soon or never will go home, it’s a hard pill to swallow.

The days, years you can’t get back. There’s no making up for lost time. Think of all the children that’ll never be born because of the 70s political rhetoric “tough on crime”. It’s only evolving. Imagine what all that money could do. So many billions to focus on the family unit, and build better education opportunities in inner city areas. Proactive solutions are the only long term solution.

And it’s economically viable. I’ll get out of prison one day, despite my 120 ½ year sentence. Then I’ll deploy what I’ve learned in a unique industry. I’ve written some outlines. It doesn't take a pulpit minister to change it all. If that was the answer, thousands of preachers would’ve prevented many men from ever becoming prisoners. And there’d be no rectivism for people of faith. The first big step starts with us and how we think inside. Removing the imagined obstacles.
