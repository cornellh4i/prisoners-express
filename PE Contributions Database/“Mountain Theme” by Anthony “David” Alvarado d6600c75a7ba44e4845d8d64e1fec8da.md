**“Mountain Theme” by Anthony “David” Alvarado**

“Views”

This place knows who I am

The mountains make me feel alone in a good way

The streams cry with me

Today there is a gray cloud nimbus

My favorite weather

The wind blows and feels like nirvana

The snow covered rocks are my dance floor

I belong here
