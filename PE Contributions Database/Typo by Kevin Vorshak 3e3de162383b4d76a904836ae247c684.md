***Typo* by Kevin Vorshak**

It is sometimes amazing and sometimes emotionally taxing when I make a typo in the address box while surfing the web. I studied Rachel’s picture to imprint her indelibly in my mind. Her fiancé, Paul, caught her in an unguarded moment in a downpour. Her car sat blurred in the background, mostly unnoticed by me since I was transfixed by her amazing eyes. A drunk struck her head-on not an hour after Paul snapped that picture. Years later, I stumbled onto her site.

<Richard?> popped up in the message window.

<I’m here, Rachel> I responded.

<How long?>

<I don’t know… Soon.>

I checked the time on the information bar -- 1:49pm. Paul that he could have it done by 2:00.

I clicked REFRESH. The site reloaded.

Did Rachel fear death? She seemed to look forward to it. Of course, it wouldn’t be death in actuality, especially since the living, breathing Rachel existed in the outside world, unaware of her digitized doppelganger. Still, in the weeks I had to get to know the digital Rachel, she became very real to me.

<Do you think it will hurt, Richard?>

<I don’t know> I didn’t see how, and I know she felt isolation if not outright loneliness. It never occurred to me that it might have hurt. I didn’t want to think about it.

<I don’t think it will. Thank you Richard>

<For what?>

<Saving me>

It struck me odd to think that arranging her death equated saving her, but I understand. The day Paul took the picture, the day of the accident, human Rachel laid in a coma from which her doctors gave her no hope of surviving.

So Paul, in his grief, did the unthinkable. He hijacked experimental equipment from the college where they researched the next generation of social media. Dubbed EternalNet, the theory consisted of capturing the memories of terminal family members and uploading them to their own memorial page. They abandoned the project for reasons Paul wouldn’t divulge, but not before he succeeded in uploading a copy of Rachel’s memories.

It was past 2:00. I clicked REFRESH, and the site reloaded. Relieved, I typed back <You’re welcome>.

Paul admitted that he interacted with the digital Rachel when not visiting her comatose body at the hospital. That all changed a little over a year later when Rachel woke up.

The doctors referred to Rachel as their “Miracle Girl.” Paul spent every spare moment with her through her rehab until the day he brought her home. They got married and had children. Abandoned, digital Rachel languished alone in cyberspace.

At least, until my typo. Even then she might have remained trapped, if the flurry of <Hello>, <Who’s there>, and <Please> in the message box had not piqued my curiosity.

So I spent weeks getting to know the ethereal, disembodied memories of digital Rachel. I gained an appreciation of the depth of Paul’s love for her which drove him to do something so amazing and horrific for her at the same time. She begged me for release and for death.

I learned enough to hunt down Paul and loved her enough to save her.

<Something’s happening. I love you Richard!>

<I love you too Rachel>

I clicked REFRESH. She was free.
