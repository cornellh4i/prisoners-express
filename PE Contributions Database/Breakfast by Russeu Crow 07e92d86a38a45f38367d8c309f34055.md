**"Breakfast" by Russeu Crow**

Breakfast. We have all heard the age-old saying, it’s the most important meal of the day it is of course nutritionally needed, still, it is so so much more. I will share two highly poignant breakfast happenings. Let's start with this. As far back as I can remember Saturday morning breakfast was always biscuits and gravy, (S.O.S.) at home. Homemade flakey, delicious buttermilk, melt in your mouth biscuits and gravy. Oh, the gravy! Always a white gravy no matter if mom or dad was the chef. Mom usually stuck to the basic dried beef gravy. Now if you're a spiritual person, it's likely what the good lord ate on the seventh day. Although if it was dad cooking it may be Ala King style gravy with Jimmy Dean sausage. So like I said as far back as I can remember. So after I left home for the navy, every Saturday was S.O.S. Not a match to ma and pa's but still good stuff. Then after I got out of the navy, I found myself in prison as a term to life inmate. The only upshot was every Saturday inside the California prison system was S.O.S.! A far cry from home-cooked I assure you, quite tasty nonetheless. About par with what the navy gave us. So life went on, riots, stabbings, lots of time in the hole. For ten years nothing really earth-shaking! Then while I was at a prison in Soledad Cal. In 1998, the Department of Corrections switched S.O.S. from Saturdays to Wednesday. This act screwed me up for months on end! Until I left for another joint almost a year later, I would always mistake my day plan. I would go back to my cell after eating it, thinking or even preparing to go to the recreation yard. Just like my free people, my work week was Monday to Friday. So you can see my screw up! It usually took me either hearing the work bell or my cellmate saying something to snap me out of it. Then after finally getting over and past that issue, the Department of Corrections made an abortion out of my beloved S.O.S. They exchanged the meat for soy. There is now such a unique part of my life missing. I know it is weird but the little things matter! Along that same line is the second happening.

There were of course interludes when that choice breakfast favorite of mine occurred. One of those was during my sophomore year in high school I went to stay with my Uncle Jake and Aunt Dot (short for Dorothy). My parents needed a break, I was more than a handful! Anyway, my aunt and uncle took me in and treated me well, except for one thing, bless her heart, but my sweet little Aunt Dot insisted on cooking my breakfast every day. I was a boy in her house and she was going to do the cooking! Now mind you, every other moment of her waking day was spent with a Salem cigarette in one hand and a harlequin romance novel in the other. She would rarely budge to pee. So every day, she made me pancakes, every day, every day-pancakes. Uncle Jake was usually off doing work. This went on day in and day out for well over a month.

One Saturday morning Uncle Jake walked into the kitchen, where I sat staring at- you guessed it, my plate of pancakes. He said: "What's with the long face kid?"

I sort of snapped then said, "Sorry Uncle Jake I just don’t think I can eat another pancake."

"Well why did you make them?"

"I didn’t, Aunt Dot did." I looked up to him and said, "She's made me the same thing every day, I tried to get her to let me cook but no she said, I didn’t want to be rude."

"So you’ve been eating the same thing every day?"

"Yep."

"Toss those in the trash." I got up and he yelled "Dorothy, I am taking Russell today with me!" I imagine through a haze of smoke, she said "okay."

We went to a truck stop and talked and talked. I learned that day that a country breakfast was S.O.S. pretty damn good. I had my first real AH-HA moment (epiphany) that day. I saw via my uncle's quiet example, what matters is making certain that we show others that they matter. From the smallest to the biggest way! I have not had a decent S.O.S. in fifteen years now; I know it's a small thing, but I still miss it! My Uncle Jake and Aunt Dot have both passed on, my mother and father as well. I miss them so much more. The first chance I get, I am going to a great little truck stop I know in Oakland after I get out, and ordering me up some country style. Maybe I will know they are kicking it with me, maybe they will know, how much I miss them.
