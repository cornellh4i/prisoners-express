**“Every Generation Deserves the Lunatics It Gets” by Larry Harwell**

I often dream of being a human, who often dreams of being a bug. I have contemplated this on what you humans call the “Arbor de Mala,” the Tree of Woe. This tree is quite friendly and takes great humbridge at being used in such a destructive manner. Although, he tells me that quite a few humans obtain enlightenment there. This is such an odd foible of your species. Why do you wait till you are near death to obtain enlightenment?

My name is Felonious Monk. I am what you call a Praying Mantis, and an Ambassador of sorts. I have taken the vows of my order for chastity, charity and compassion. If you have ever seen a Mantis mating ritual, you’ll know why I have avoided it. I am not losing my head over a moment’s indiscretion. I love what your own General Patton said. “Get the other bastard to die for his country.” Selch!

I suppose our shared dreaming has helped me in understanding your young species. How you have avoided annihilating yourselves is a mystery to my genus. You showed up in our collective memory about 200,000 years ago. Many of my friends and colleagues do not share my optimism of your successful evolution to your next level, Homo Luminus.

The worms are especially rooting for your demise. Impaling them on fish hooks, good God man! The Dung Beetle seems to be indifferent about the whole matter. Since we have inhabited our mother for millions of years, you may only be a flash in the pan -- so to speak.

That you have not learned to work with us for a mutual benefit has stumped my tiny brain. The Bees, the Flower Children of the wasp tribe, has been together, howbeit, to a very small collective of enlightened beings. The hive hum of Bees, like chanting monks calling us to Vespers, urging you to forsake violent mercantile thinking, and join with all Nature and embrace a long fulfilling life. Otherwise us bugs will once again inherit the Earth. Perhaps we are the meek your Avatars speak of. The roaches think they will be the dominant bug. They are so egotistical.
