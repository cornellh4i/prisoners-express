The seer placed her mottled hand over the left side of her face matching its root of wrinkles, pool far pool, her milky white dead eye began to hue slightly, a soft powdery blue essence. She spoke to me in a distant echo. My tune of a whisper that seemed to radiate inside of my skull as candlelight danced, and shadows rose and shirked on the distance of the caves walls, which seems to breath and hiss a whisper of their own accord. A brief, knowing smile stole across my tightly drawn lips as she spoke. “You will find what you seek with-in all you have ever seeked in life is within the one of great balance of hearts.”

I instantly knew what she meant. I revolved her words over and over as her tone seemed to echo further and further distantly.

I felt an unmistaken heat. The soft hue emitting from her eye, receding, blinking, she removed her hand from her face and smiled a toothless grin.

As before, I was instantly struck captive by the un-natural inky green of her left eye. Slowly, she opened her mouth, lips stretching with strain. Its blackness was competing with distant galaxies. No tongue greeted me as a stuttering moan of great weight shimmeringly revved up from the gaping maw.

I continued to sit back on my haunches, long forgotten feet numb, hands firmly gripping the two crystal rocks as directed by the seer, far to loose my grip on these crystals would be tantamount to the both of us losing our way back into present reality.

I had traversed oceans and mountain ranges to be in this moment, to inhale this atmosphere.

Slowly, I unfurled my grip, and unrolling my fingertips, I had come to set us free from disjointedness, my one true self, separated by a constructed age of reinforcement.

Softly, like an ebbing tile, the voice rose once again pervading my skull from inside.

“Careful. Beware.” It repeated several times as I inhaled the dusky cool air deeply through my nostrils as time crept up my spine, like a knife at the base of my skull. As I stood, the seer looked up. With my numb ankles and feet haggering my stance, I watched silently as the wrinkled mottled mahogany stained skin slogged off in dry chunks that whispered into ash. As the seer’s soul rose up into the air, its illuminating sun lit the cavernous walls as I turned in a limp, examining the space around me.

Now was the time, I felt it, sharply and suddenly I jolted back my arms, welcoming, stretching my shoulder joints completely. The seer’s soul, my soul, tattered and turn so long ago, was now almost complete. The bluish bue it gave off began to flicker as it whispered to and from on the slight air current before me. I absorbed it in total, and the process long and painful. Sitting to my haunches, once again, and hanging my head with exhaustion after the feat, my soul was now complete.

I’ve rested ever since in total bliss.
