**“Blink of an Eye” by Jeremy Brown**

Image. Form. Sound. Taste. Feeling. Emotion. Motion. Energy. Water droplets. Blood, veins, sinew. Muscles, tendons. Neural pathways. Vibrations, frequency. Words, music, bones. Light. In the blink of an eye, I was conceived. Many intelligences were involved in this co-creation--those of five planets and a star, to be exact. I see the essence of all these conflicting idealisms within my mind. Mars: war; Venus: love; Saturn: death; Mercury: wisdom; Earth: carnal desire; and Sun: light. Each of the six represent a part of the Entity’s consciousness. These six beings within me at first caused much distress and suffering, until I learned how to command them all within my mind.

In the blink of an eye, we each are conceived with cosmic influences that either better or destroy our lives.

It took 27 years for me to figure out this concept, due to the ignorance of my family in esoteric and spiritual matters. Now, I know why certain choices were made: to indulge my own selfish desires. In the blink of an eye, I learned astrology is a real science; beyond horoscopes and beyond mere fortune tellers.

True astrology has helped me see that when I feel overwhelming anger, it is Aries of Mars acting upon my consciousness. When I mindfully notice this, I command my anger to stop and to not overwhelm me. If I see a man or woman that I may have a physical attraction to, this is only Venus acting negatively through lust upon me. So, I restructure this physical desire into spiritual love. I realize *self* through all of this. I notice I am commanding the negative aspect and re-influencing myself to positive actualization of the potential hidden within me.

This has been astounding to me, in the past two years of my practical application, to directly experience the concepts of astrology. We humans blink our eyes almost 100 times in two minutes! The cliche that life is the “blink of an eye” is truly profound if we connect to the idea that time does not really exist. If we do not watch time, life flows more freely with moments passing quicker than expected. So we must not think of time or look at clocks, so that in the blink of an eye we may pass from this fleeting physical existence and transition through Saturn unto our higher selves. Saturn represents the death of our old selves and the transition of this life unto the next. May all sentient beings enlighten themselves!
