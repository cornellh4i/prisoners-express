**“Four Years and Waiting” by Michael Lanning**

In my heart, a river flows whose waters have been slowed by bitter words and broken promises. Which now are more common than not. Lies may be forgiven, but hard to be forgotten.

You solemnly swore, but lied to my face. So much for the promises we embraced. What happened to honor or the pledge you gave? Binding words from cradle to grave. When the value of an oath is simply spoke, a traiter must pay for promises broke.

You crossed your heart and hoped to die. But the deceit in your eyes reveal one more lie. Death before dishonor is what the vows allege. Your vows are empty, time to uphold your pledge.

Not from rejected love, for I have learned to love myself. What I could not understand, was the level of gut wrenching pain you tortured me with your parting.

When I think of you I remember what we lost that day. Back to being a prisoner spending life locked away in lonely darkness. When I fell for you, truly I fell hard. Now every door shut, every window barred. With memory of you, the pain turns me black. My heart now chained and locked. Until I’m dead, never to come back.

Should I look for one who may Quench my thirst? I went through you, can anyone be any worse? I share my water with strangers. Drifters staying for only a night. Visitors passing through for a sip. Soulless, as depressed and alone as I.

It’s Quite a change from you that absorbed me wholly before ripping me to pieces with your heartless hatred of what we were. The writing was on the wall, “I know it’s wrong.” Your words not mine.

Yet for some bizarre fucked-up reason I’m drawn to you like a moth to a flame. Wanting to take possession, making a claim. Placing each before the other. For the first time in my life I desired no other.

My dreams still have fingers grasping the stem of you, as our sugar dances comes to an end.
