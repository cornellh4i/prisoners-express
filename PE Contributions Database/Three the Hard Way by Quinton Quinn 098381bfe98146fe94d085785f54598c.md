**Three the Hard Way by Quinton Quinn**

I opened my eyes, but was unable to see. My vision was blurred. I try my best to focus. I had no idea where I was.

I raised up and sat quietly on the edge of the couch. I could hear the echo of voices pulsating the room, some soft as a whisper, some loud enough to wake the dead.

I search the room with my eyes in hope of finding something or someone that would give me an idea of where I could be. My eyes search from ceiling to floor, from wall to wall. Nothing!

I looked beside me on the couch. There sitting next to me pass out drunk, the smell of vodka pouring from his pores, was my best friend Todd.

At that moment everything came rushing back to me. We were at Rick’s party and must have passed out drunk as usual. That seems to be the norm for me, Todd, and the third man in our crew, Joe. Speaking of Joe - I noticed he was nowhere in sight. Now that was odd because we never left each other without saying something. That was one of our blood brothers rules. “Come together, leave together!” No exceptions! So where was Joe?

I searched the apartment looking in every room. If it had a door I looked inside it. I was almost ready to relinquish my hunt for my friend. When suddenly I noticed a body laid out on the back end of the couch. I saw that the bottom of the shoes said Converse. I knew then that it was Joe. I laughed out loud, gathered my friends together and we left the party.

As we walked sideways to our apartment that was only ten blocks away. I yelled out loud, “one hundred parties down and a million more to go!” Both Todd and Joe repeated those words in a drunken slur.

The week was out, it was Friday, and Todd, Joe, and I were ready to party. We all lived together in a small three bedroom apartment. We had been roommates since our first year of college - over six years ago now. My name is Nate, and Joe, Todd, and I have been buddies since high school.

A few years ago we all dropped out of school for mediocre jobs. Truth be told we were scarcely getting by, and we were all very active alcoholics. But we decided a long time ago that we would ride or die together. Bros for life.

I looked in the mirror and laughed as I combed my hair back and splashed on my cheap dollar store cologne, I stepped out of the bedroom after looking into the mirror for the hundredth time.

Todd and Joe were waiting for me with a plastic cup filled to the top with vodka. We walked out of the door headed for downtown. I thought to myself “we would make it home tonight before passing out drunk.”

Once again I woke up and did not know where I was. It took a few minutes for me to realize that I was at home. I had no idea how I got here. Joe was on the floor stretched out, mouth wide open. Todd was out cold on the love seat. There were beer cans everywhere along with an empty gallon of vodka. I whispered to no one in particular “Another day in the life of the three amigos.” then all went black.

The holidays had come again, my mom invited me and the guys to the house for thanksgiving dinner. We were all very happy because we knew how my family got down during the holidays. Lots of good times, food, and drinking.

We didn’t own a car so when the time came around my mom picked us up at the bus station downtown, and we headed to the family house which was an hour ride from the city.

We were having a great time. The food was awesome. The last thing I remember was playing cards before everything went blank.

I woke up the next evening in my old bedroom to the sound of my mom calling my name from the hallway. “Nate! Nate!”

“Yes.” I said in a low voice.

“Get up and get ready so that I can take you boys back to the city.” An hour and some minutes later we were back in the city where the people never sleep. Man, I love New Orleans.

I decided not to visit my mom for Christmas, mostly because I was still kind of embarrassed about not knowing how things ended the day of Thanksgiving.

A few days before Christmas I received a card in the mail from my mom. Inside was a picture of me and the guys passed out on the couch. I had never seen a picture of us passed out drunk like that. It made me sick to my stomach, it was one of the most pathetic sights I had ever seen.

I knew right then we needed help and it was not going to be easy. But the three of us would endure it the hard way. First step: A.A.
