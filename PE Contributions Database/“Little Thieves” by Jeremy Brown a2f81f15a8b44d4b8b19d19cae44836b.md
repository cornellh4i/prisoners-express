**“Little Thieves” by Jeremy Brown**

These two children are the quickest thieves in the world. Undetectable, they stole the wig from President Donald Trump. Or his toupee. Now he must walk around life like a bald buffoon. We made quite a hefty price off of it – 12 trillion dollars! The buyer was Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. He is the next buffoon. Problem with him wearing it was that he now looked like Trump. He was found dead 2 days later. Stormy Daniels was indicted on murder charges. “I thought it was him, I did I did I swear it!” she said in court. The judge only slapped her with 10 years, he was a huge fan of hers anyhow. Our next thing we will take and burn is Pope Francis’s hat. If caught I will say “It’s because Pope Francis is the walking living breathing Satanic Antichrist after all.” Maybe I will get caught so the world knows the truth. He’s the next buffoon we will get. I love my little thieves. After all they can’t be caught.
