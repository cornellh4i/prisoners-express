**“Sisters” by Cesar Hernandez**

My wife and I both have two sisters. My wife basically raises both of her sisters. Her mom makes my wife raise her sisters. She doesn’t want her daughters to be stuck in the kitchen all day. She wants her three daughters to be educated.

My wife raises her two younger sisters while their mom spends all day in the kitchen. Her mom doesn’t ever teach my wife how to cook. We always eat out at restaurants.

My wife’s sisters are both little monsters. They are the main reason why we did not ever have a rush to have our own child.

My two sisters are okay. I don’t recall them being little monsters. My second sister always screams her head off. She has some strong lungs. I can’t understand how she doesn’t bust her own eardrums.

My sister was a complete surprise. We didn’t even know she was on the way until six months into the pregnancy, I don’t recall how long it took for our parents to tell us our sister is on the way. I already had some sense. Mom all of a sudden starts pointing out baby stuff at the stores.

The four of us are going somewhere. Dad very casually says that our sister is on the way. Neither my sister nor I say anything. Dad simply keeps driving wherever we are going.

My second sister was born very premature. While she is being born, I’m eating Pizza Hut and drinking Skyy. Dad calls and says I have a second sister. She is very small and weak. They don’t let us take her home. She stays in the hospital for a few days. She is very easy to spot in the nursery. She’s the one that glows blue. They have her wrapped in a blanket with a rectangular UV light on her back. The UV light is so she can finish cooking. When we finally take her home, the doctor says she needs sunlight for a few hours each day.

I don’t carry my sister for six months. She is so small and weak. I don’t want to get attached, I didn’t think she would survive.
