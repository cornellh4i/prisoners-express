**SISTERS by Yankee Lawyer**

Laura was born on January 17, 1989. Becky was delivered on January 25, 1990. Laura was just learning to walk and talk, so there was never the bitter jealousy between them that often arises that a firstborn child feels that siblings have alienated the parental affections and weakened their position in the household. To this day, as far as I know, Laura and her sister remain good friends.

They always remembered who was older though. Laura was the leader that the twins looked to for guidance. The girls were very close before Pamela snatched them. However, Becky never followed her siblings.

When social workers tried to get her to accuse her father, Laura didn’t understand what was happening, but she spoke freely, and police occasionally got something she could use.

Becky was stubborn, She stuck to the unadulterated truth:

“Mommy’s mean! Mommy’s mean!”

“Mommy’s a liar! Mommy’s a liar!”

When her mother put her into the children’s psychiatric unit in Moses Cone Hospital to be reprogrammed, Becky had already been separated from her protective parent for two years. Now she was separated from her sister.

Becky held out for almost a week. Every day, she was told to accuse her father. She was promised rewards. She refused to lie. Her daddy had taught her to always tell her the truth - the whole truth and nothing but the truth - even when it hurt. She was severely punished.

The staff used drugs and threats of drugs to try to get their victim to change her testimony. Still, Becky refused to speak lies to a room full of witnesses, she did, however, finally write a note. I don’t know what it said, but I was “tried,” acquitted by a jury, and sentenced to life in prison.

Becky was reunited with her sister, Soon, she was a star in Pamela’s boyfriend’s sadistic videos.
