**“Horns” by Nate A. Lindell**

When I entered the federal prison system in December 2013, the many prisoners I saw with tattoos on their faces and heads shocked me.

That’d never happen in Wisconsin’s prison system, I thought. (Wisconsin’s prison system was where I came from and where I’d eventually return to serve my life sentence.) If a Wisconsin prisoner came out of his cell with a tattoo on his head or face, the unit he was on would be locked down and all the cells searched. Confidential informants would tell who did the tattoo and where he hid his gun, and everyone involved--and some who weren’t--would get some months in unitive seg.

I was in Allenwood U.S. Penitentiary where the administration had more important things to worry about than tattoos. A couple days before I arrived, an old man was beaten brain dead by a Dirty White Boy. While I was there, some guy who was bullying his cellie got his facial bones powderized by his cellie with a stone in a laundry bag.

At the time, I was an Aryan Circle member. Although in the federal system, different racial/ethnic groups are required by their leaders to be respectful toward others (disrespect toward other races will lead to a race riot which can spread across the whole system and probably get people killed), that wasn’t the case in my home state. Many times Black and sometimes Latino prisoners attacked me because of my race and culture, and I’d retaliate: one guy threatened to jump on me with his gang buddies, and so I stabbed him in the face.

The racial detente in the feds, I knew, wouldn’t last. Wisconsin would pull me back, and so while in the feds, I intended to get all I could, including head tattoos.

When a Latino prisoner ineffectively attacked a guard in the chow hall, twenty feet from me, we were all locked in our cells for a week. During that lockdown, I had my toothless, meth-head cellie go nuts on my head with his tattoo gun. On the back of my head, I had him put a Celtic knot inspired horned owl to scare off anyone who might try to attack me from behind. On the side of my head, I had him put “144,” my full-scale I.Q. score, and from the ends of my eyebrow to the crown of my head, he put solid black horns.

The horns had multiple meanings. The next time someone called me a white devil, I’d say, “Duh!” I was an Atheist, not a Satanist, and the horns should discourage theists from bringing their mind poison to me. Horns also, to me, symbolized rejection of authority, as Satan did God in the Christian myth. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was like Satan in that he enlightened humanity against Zeus’ will. I saw myself as a Promethean as I enlighten humanity through my blog, Prometheus Writes! Last and most importantly, I wanted female staff to ask me, “What do those horns mean?”

“I’m horny,” I’d answer, and see where it went from there. Every female staff member who’s seen them has been amused, especially the many who’ve asked what they mean. Male staff almost always frown on them--little-horn complexes, no doubt.

I was also going to get a snorkel tattooed on my face with the words “Muff Diver” along the tube--boy, would that have driven Wisconsin guards up the fence! But a buddy I made, Tommy “The Butcher” Pitera, urged me not to get any more head or face tattoos. I was teaching him how to draw, and he wanted to plug me with wealthy but conservative art buyers who might be turned off by such tattoos.

Nicknames are common in prison and often based on a prominent feature. With my large, blatant horns, I inevitably was called “Horns.” Now that I’m back in Wisconsin’s prison system, the nickname has followed me. Keep it horny!
