**"My First Reunion: The Best - The Worst of It" by Curtis Colvin**

The first “reunion” I remember was the one where I came back from the Navy the first time. I had done 8 weeks in boot camp at Great Lakes, Illinois. As soon as I graduated, I was sent to Signalman “A” School in Orlando, Florida. I was Titene for another 8 weeks. Then I finally got a two week vacation, to return home, before going to my duty station called Beach Masters Unit I. We were located on Coronado Island.

My mother picked me up at the Jefferson County Airport in Beaumont. I was so happy to see her. As soon as I got home in Bridge City, Texas, friends galore came to see me. My sisters and brother were in awe as I came home wearing my sailor outfit (Whites). I borrowed a friend’s motorcycle and drove around in my Whites to “show off” for it isn’t often you see a sailor on a motorcycle riding around Bridge City. It was the best reunion I’ve ever had. Now comes the worst part of it…

Late in the afternoon, still in my dress Whites, we were (my friends) playing frisbee in my front yard. It was hot and I was thirsty. One of my friends (or was it a cousin of mine) made some mushroom tea. We have these magical mushrooms growing all over the place here in Southeast Texas. The trick of making tea is to use the tops only, for the stems has a lot of strychnine in them. But whomever made this batch used stems and all.

Me being thirsty, I downed two giant glassfuls and started on my third when I noticed I couldn’t throw the frisbee anymore… Now comes the bad part of the reunion… I had these thoughts that “aliens” but mushrooms on this Earth to take control of us. So I grabbed the whole bowl of tea, and ran to the bathroom and flushed it while being chased by my friends to stop. Next, I pulled out a half ounce of marijuana out of my pants (that I had purchased earlier in the day) and started to yell “Weed, weed,” and was throwing around my room like Mardi Gras beads.

Next I grabbed my girlfriend’s hand and started running and jumping in my backyard yelling, “We’re free, we’re free,” which in the process, my wallet fell out of my pocket containing a few hundred dollars. Thank God my mother found it.

Then I was visited by neighbors, more friends, and my girlfriends’ parents to welcome me home. I’m sorry to say I can’t remember what all was said--or done. All I know is I had a lot of apologies to express the next day.

But to top it all off was when I slapped my mother. I have never ever, before or since, raised a hand to my mom. I was an obedient son. But when my mother found out I was tripping, she walked up to me and slapped me shouting, “Snap out of it!” My reaction was to slap her back. I regret it to this day. Her reaction was to find me some downers to calm me down or put me to sleep. I don’t remember much after that. I did wake up knowing that I had made mistakes and was asking what happened. I have never touched mushroom tea since, and I doubt I ever will.

So now you know the best, and the worst, f my first reunion with my family, after being gone for a while.
