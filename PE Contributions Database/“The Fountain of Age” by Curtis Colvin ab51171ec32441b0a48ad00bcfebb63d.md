**“The Fountain of Age” by Curtis Colvin**

Everyone has heard of the fountain of youth. Now I will tell you about the fountain of age. And it does work, too well, as a matter of fact. I should know. I’m 27 years old, but I look 72. Let me explain.

I was casually sailing my 18’ catamaran one day off the Hawaiian coast of Maui. After a few hours, an unusual fog settled in. I got lost and my internal directions got mixed up. I sailed into a clearing (one would say it was the eye of the fog) to find a tomb looking structure, between two trees, on a rocky island. I snapped this picture right before I docked on it.

Because of the open doorway, I was curious to find out what was inside. After I climbed the somewhat wide, odd steps, I peeked inside to a dark room. There was a sound of running water and the room smelt old and dusty. It was about 10’ by 10’ and the height was about the same. In the middle of the room, there was a bowl-like boulder about the size of a dishwasher. It was overflowing into a trough about two feet long, which in turn disappeared into the floor. If you look closely at the picture I took, you can see it draining out the front, into the ocean. No tombs, no bodies, no treasure. Boring!

Well the water looked wet and clean, and I was thirsty, so I bent down, cupped my hands, and drank some. It tasted like clean ozarka water out of a bottle.

When I woke up (it was a surprise to me; I don’t remember falling asleep), I was sore all over. It felt like I ran in an Ironman Triathlon...twice. I stumbled out, got on my cat, and paddled away. I went back through the fog, napped on my board (why was I so tired?), and made it back to shore.

I got my cat loaded, cranked up the Chevy, and had a heart attack, literally.

I woke up in the hospital in critical care. They asked a whole lot of questions. I gave answers. But they didn’t believe my age. One of the nurses gave me a mirror and I had another heart attack, figuratively speaking this time. I WAS OLD.

To this day, I don’t know how or where that island is. I do know nobody wants to drink from it. I guarantee it!
