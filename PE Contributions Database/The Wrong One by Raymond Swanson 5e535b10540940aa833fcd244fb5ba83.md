"The Wrong One" by Raymond Swanson

I fell in love when I was seventeen. Not exactly young love, yet not what I would understand love as, as an adult. One day after cheer practice I was out in front of the school gym waiting for my friend Jenna’s mom to pick us up. Jenna was crazily snapping pictures on her cellphone when a care-car-loud pick up pulled in the driveway.

“Oh, hell no,” Jenna said aloud.

The truck pulled beside us and the door was pushed open by the driver leaning across the seat.

“Hey brat,” the driver said. “Mom’s busy, so here I am. Let’s go.”

We tore out of the lot like bandits. Jenna’s brother was HOT, and I didn’t care that he was four years older than myself. I wanted so badly to switch our seats in the truck to be beside his farm boy, volunteer fireman body. She told him I lived just up the road and he said he’d drop me off after dropping her off, on his way to work.

Jenna jumped out of the cab after climbing over my legs. I said I’d see her at school, and we pulled away. Before his sister was even out of sight he said he’d heard things about me. I asked what he’d heard and he said “just things.” Then he was silent until we stopped at the stop sign just before my driveway.

“People used to say stuff about me, too,” he said. “Just didn’t bother me,” he finished as he pulled up out front.

“Maybe you should pick us up more” I told him.

For the next two months he only missed picking us up twice and each time, after dropping Jenna at their house we would make small talk, sometimes even taking a “detour” to continue the conversation. Then, one day Jenna said he’d had a fight, broke a fella’s nose and was gone. Left a short note, for her only, and split. I went through my senior year just wondering, *what the hell.*

One evening after studying for finals with Jenna, I was walking home when a beat up Chevy truck pulled up beside me. It was dusk and I got nervous; that is, until I heard the voice.

“Hey cheer girl,” he said and laughed as he opened the door just like he’d done that day at the school. I jumped in, giddy as could be and we drove to a secluded spot near the lazy river that flowed through the county. His hair was slightly longer and a thin beard accentuated and brought out his green eyes. Over a year of heartbreak and I was in love with him all over again.

“I’ve missed your blue eyes,” he told me, and in that moment I knew I had to have him stay.

I leaned over and kissed his mouth and never flinched as his hand found my flat stomach, my chest. I pulled away only to reposition for the seatbelt was digging into my back. The next morning I awoke in my own bed with no idea how I got there. There was a goodbye letter on my night stand. I cried for two days, no joke.

A tear rolled down my cheek when I found the letter in a shoebox with a bag of pictures from my senior year just the other day. All it said was, “Really sorry I can’t stick around. Always loved you.”

I’ve seen him twice since that night by the river. Once when Jenna graduated from college with a law degree and just last October at the Homecoming football game. We both have grown up and each have children, though not with each other as I one day thought, or dreamed, we would. I’ve been married three years now and he’s been married three times and struggles to pay support for five kids. He drinks a lot and has been arrested more than twice for fighting.

Sometimes when I look at my beautiful baby, I’ll think of all those nights he took me home and all those talks we had after cheer practice. Then, when my baby smiles I’m thankful that I was an inexperienced lover who tried to take control that night. I’d take the discomfort while sitting to a lifetime talking to him in a minute. Sometimes we’re just better off, I guess.
