Laughing is fun and makes people feel good. I love to go to the Mall and see people laugh. I love watching Comedy Central, and I’m in love with Comedy movies. It’s so fun to laugh!

I’ve got a sense of humor too; I know I do. In school, the teacher would scream and shout, and so I laugh my ass off way too loud. Even when I’m high, I laugh too loud. It’s bad, but I love making people laugh. I used to do stupid stunts to make people laugh and even used to host an online radio show called “Friday Night Laughs” where I would prank call places and tell jokes and life experiences. People told me that my show would make their night. That’s a feeling I love. I just try to keep the fun rolling and the laughter coming!
