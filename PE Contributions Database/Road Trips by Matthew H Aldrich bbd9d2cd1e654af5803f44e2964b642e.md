**"Road Trip" by Matthew H. Aldrich**

“Road Trip!” 1975. I was seven years old, and I lived with my mom, dad, and little sister in Pascagoula, Mississippi by way of rural New York. Up to that point in my life, the words “road trip” would have best defined my life experience. I had moved more than a dozen times, and I had even traveled with my family following a large carnival in the northeast; but our midway - game trailer burned to the axis on the side of the highway. Caution: smoking may be dangerous to your stuffed animals.

My mom and dad were friends with the couple who lived in the upstairs apartment, Jose and Lori. My dad masterminded a plan for a road trip with them to California. Jose had a van, and my dad had a station wagon. I remember helping them remove the engine and transmission from the van, and how my dad welded a tow hitch to the van’s front end. He was a Class A welder and could secure a job at any shipyard, and California had many.

With the van hitched to the station wagon, the six of us loaded up our possessions, including my bicycle on the roof of the wagon, and headed West. It was my job to keep the styrofoam cooler from squeaking.

We stopped over near Brownsville, Texas one morning. My dad and Jose left us with the van beside the Rio Grande at a small unofficial campsite. Unexpectedly, they did not return that night. It turned out that they were arrested by Mexican authorities. Fortunately, they were able to bribe their way out of jail the next day, and we were able to continue our road trip.

We eventually arrived at a long stretch of Pacific shore, just immediately south of where the Queen Mary was docked in Long Beach, California. The shoreline was then undeveloped, but it was carefully built up with massive rocks and leveled off with beautiful sand.

We set up camp there with the van, the unhitched station wagon, a campfire, and our styrofoam cooler stocked with hot dogs, mayo, mustard, ketchup, and bologna floating in melting ice. We lived there for months. Jose and Lori moved on. My dad was always gone during the day, welding at the shipyard.

I passed my days climbing among the big rocks and the large crevices between them at low tide. I explored the starfish, sea urchins, mussels, crabs, and other scurrying creatures. I learned how to fish and cast a line off a soda can. Within walking distance was the Pike, an old amusement park, and there were nearby streets lined with tattoo parlors; from where my mom came home late with her colorful butterflies, and my dad with the pink panther on his upper arm with JANICE inked underneath it.

Eventually, we moved into a house, which we shared with another couple and their son who was older than me. I remember chasing my beloved skateboard into the four lanes of busy traffic there; nearly getting ran over, and then picking up the two halves and carrying them home. My dad repaired it. Also, I remember fighting with the boy who lived there. Then one day my dad had a brainstorm, which led us on our next road trip, back to rural New York. Keeping a styrofoam cooler from squeaking in the back of a station wagon for 3,000 miles is harder than you may think. And the road trips continued…
