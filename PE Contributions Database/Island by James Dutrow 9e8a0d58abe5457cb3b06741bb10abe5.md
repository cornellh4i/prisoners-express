**"Island" by James Dutrow**

They say that no man is an island. I would have to disagree. I was placed, by the hands of the fates both cruel and kind, on the island. Over the years I have come to accept my exile here in the middle of the ocean. My needs have become simple, my duty harsh. In simpler terms, I build.

My home, a stone hut, is nothing to brag about, but its roof keeps the rain off me and its walls offer some protection from the wind. No windows. No door. Only a ragged curtain hung across the opening made from weaving strips torn from old blankets. My meals come from the sea, some bird eggs from the ones that inhabit the island, and a few nuts that fell from the pair of trees sharing my exile.

Life on the island begins the same every day. I wake to the sound of the birds fishing for their breakfast in the morning tide. I wish that I could find the snooze button, but no such luck. Taking a few moments after a light breakfast of last night's leftovers, I mix up a batch of mortar from sand, fire, ash, and seawater. Then, I haul a load of bricks from my hut to the outer edge of the island. Slowly, brick by brick, day by day I build a wall around the island. When I have used up my bricks for the day, I go to the cliff on the backside of the island where I cut stone for more bricks. It takes several hours to cut enough bricks for the next day's work and often it is well after dark before I am done.

Lately I’ve started to bring several bricks into the hut at night. With crude tools, I carve words into the sides of the bricks. Sometimes, the words are happy. Like stars, songs, or even home. Other times, they are not so happy, but likewise they reflect my thoughts on the islands. Like alone, quiet, and sorry. These words appear more often in my wall. In a sense, the wall has become a journal in my exile.

Once a month, when the moon is dark, a small boat lands at the islands little crescent beach. They leave a package for me. A few bars of soap, toothpaste, and a couple matches. Twice a year, I get a bundle of blankets and some new clothes. Never enough to be warm, but at least I don’t freeze. Sometimes if I build enough they include some food or chocolate in the package. This is the only outside food I get, so I always try to build as much as I can.

I used to lay in wait near the beach and try to catch the people who leave the packages. One time, I finally saw them late in the night, and tried to talk to them I was so hungry for conversation that I charged out of my hiding place, jabbering too fast to even be understood. The package bringers did not answer, they just got back in their boat, and left. I got no packages that month and it was a long cold month with no matches for a fire. So I built even faster and the next month they left two cans of spam and a chocolate bar. Work always equaled treats.

A few years ago I finished the outer wall. The top row was almost twice my height and I had had to use a crude ladder, fashioned out of driftwood, to put the cap stones on. What now? What could the watchers want me to build next? Finally it came to me!

The next morning I began my maze. Starting at the steps going down to the beach, I built a labyrinth of walls just wide enough for one person to walk through. I made the walls snitch back upon itself, twisting around and around. I built in several false trails and dead ends. It didn’t seem that the watchers cared exactly what I built, the rules were the same. More building, more treats.

Last night, I heard something that I have not heard in many years. Voices. They were not the sound of the birds, or the wind, or even the sound of my own voice echoing off the walls of my maze. The conclusion was clear. There were people, many people on my island.

From the location of the sound, they had already found the entrance of my maze and were trying to reach my hut. I ran as fast as I could through my maze to my hut, blew out my candle and stomped out my little cooking fire. I spent the night huddled under my ratty blanket in the corner of my hut listening to the intruders as they tromped around my maze trying to find me. I closed my eyes wishing that they would leave my island alone. After many fearful hours I fell into a fitful sleep.

The morning dawned bright and clear. The birds called their hello's while fishing for their breakfast. The voices, the intruders were gone. I had no bricks to build with today. The watchers would notice and there would be no treat in the package this month. But, this doesn’t matter to me anymore. The people were gone and I have my solitude once again. They never found me.

My prison had become my fortress.
