**“An Attitude of Gratitude” by DJ Forbes**

Having an attitude of gratitude while in prison can be difficult, but it’s something I’m working towards. Yes, prison is a form of punishment, and no one I know got here without doing something wrong, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t positive aspects of it to be grateful for. Allow me to share with you some that I’ve found.

First and foremost, prison was a life-saving intervention for me. My entire family agrees---the way I was going, I’d probably be dead by now if it weren’t for my arrest. For this, I am grateful.

By providing for my basic needs, prison gives me the opportunity to focus my energies into making needed changes to my life. I’d probably not be able to make these changes if I were working full-time to support myself on the streets. Sure, what we get here isn’t that great, but I eat every day, have clothes on my back, and have a place to sleep---things many people on the street have to worry about. For this I am grateful.

Prison has also allowed me to get in shape. At the time of my arrest I weighed a measly 137 pounds, severely underweight for my 6’2” frame. I couldn’t even jog one-quarter mile lap or do ten pushups. Last October, I completed my very first marathon (104 laps) and recently performed better at a physical fitness test than I thought I could. For this, I am grateful.

The Governor’s Fee Waiver provides me with the means to take college classes. I am currently working towards an associate’s degree without having to worry about the tuition costs. Since many of the textbooks are available on the e-readers that the Education Department checks out to us, I have yet to buy any books. For this, I am grateful.

I’d have to say though, what I am most grateful for, surprisingly enough, is the common aggravations of prison life. All the officers who go out of their way to make things tougher than they need to be, all the inmates who whine and complain about anything and everything, and all the frustration from not being able to do things when I want are all the major motivations to rehabilitate myself. I hate prison life so much that I’m willing to do what I wasn’t before: live my life in an honest and upstanding fashion.

So yeah, prison sucks! That just makes me want to get out and NEVER come back. And for this, I am infinitely grateful!
