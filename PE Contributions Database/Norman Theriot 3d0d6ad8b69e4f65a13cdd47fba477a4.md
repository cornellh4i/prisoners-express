Laughter, a word of joy, for any human it is a bright spot if they let it into their lives. It is said that a smile is worth a thousand words. Laughter is a smile magnified, a release for the soul for a laughter's presence is a glorious freedom. At least for the mind anyway. Laughter is contagious: it lightens a gloomy day and cures depression (if only for a short while). It makes life worth living, and it can take oneâ€™s breath away. Simple things can bring on fits of laughter: a grown man dodging a rat, a child acting silly, an animal being itself, and some even laugh for no reason at all.

So laugh. It heals the soul and takes you away from what ails you for a while.
