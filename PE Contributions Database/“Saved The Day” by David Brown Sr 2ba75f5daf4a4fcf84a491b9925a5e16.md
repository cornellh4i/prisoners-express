**“Saved The Day” by David Brown Sr.**

It sounded like a stampede. The sounds of something running but nothing In eyesight. I’m in one of the remote places In Alaska, 22 miles from civilization, surrounded by nothing but ice and water. I’ve been trapped In the same spot for 11 hours and counting according to my wrist watch. My leg seems to be snapped in two, and I'm feeling early signs of hypothermia.

Just yesterday, I was surrounded by my beautiful Angela, our kids, and grandkids in our lovely home. Speaking of … kids do say the most incredible things that only they know the meaning of. They flew in from Sherman, Texas, a town north of Dallas, to see me off on my Great Adventure. I also had a hidden agenda behind flying the family out. I couldn’t just leave the love of 3 lifetimes in our secluded home without company. So I called in the reinforcements. If I know our little ones, they’ll never leave GiGi’s sight. GiGi is the name they’ve called my wife since they could cry. And I'm Papaw, the one everyone wants to cook. But not today; she’s given me today off to enjoy her cooking and the family before I go.

I called my 2 best friends to make sure that they were on schedule and still meeting me at the cabin we rented on time. We were on a tight schedule due to our jobs and family, so we made a pact to not be late doing anything before or after the trip. They both picked up on the conference call, we discussed the details twice, then hung up.

I arrived 1st, unpacked my gear, left some outside and put everything else inside! I checked my new watch Angela gave me for my 41st birthday and it read 6:23 AM [They’re Late]. I couldn’t call them because there are no towers within a 30 mile radius of the cabin. Time was of the essence. This was a once in a lifetime thing [like seeing the 7 wonders of the world]. A Red Moon in Alaska that could only be seen from Topman's Bay at a certain time and day, and that day was tomorrow.

I unchained my snowmobile from the 3 and headed out. I checked the map every 2 or 3 miles. I was right on schedule. About 4 miles from Topmans I hit something and ended up down the hill w/a broken leg. *I couldn’t move*, was my only thought. Next, that Angela was going to kill me for leaving w/o Barry and t/ip.

Barry and t/ip were going to surprise me without a guide, only to find out I wasn’t there. They saw my things in the cabin; one snowmobile short and knew I’d left. The guide said we best get going if he’s out there alone. The guide is old-fashioned, so he only travels the old-fashioned way. [Sled] He stands on his sled and they mount their new age snowmobiles. “Mush” he says, and the Huskies charge like at war.

I hear something and see snow coming over the horizon. I pull my flare and fire a shot. And there comes the stampede. A pack of Huskies led by a driver. He sees me and waves a hand. I wave back for acknowledgement. Your friends sent me ahead to make sure you were alright. They’re having trouble w/ their machines. Let's get you back. I ask his name. He says Angelo. I immediately think of my Angela and say “my angel.” I shake his hand, tell him I’ve been in better shape but it's ok …. I'd rather go to Topman's.
