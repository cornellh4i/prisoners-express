***Melancholy Eyes* by Shaun Blake**

Rain poured down on us as I stood admiring her. She was dressed in black with a string of pearls around her neck. Her simply dress and cinched coat showed a neat, slim figure, and she had a pretty face that wasn’t excessively made-up. She held a black umbrella tightly with both hands as if it might blow away, leaving her naked.

She turned her eyes my way. Splendid dark eyes, the most moving eyes I’ve ever seen. They seemed to be on the verge of filling with tears, suggesting a life too hard for her. I felt I must stand between that suffering and her, to take the sadness out of those big, melancholy eyes.

I immediately had an uneasy suspicion that she wouldn’t like me, and if that were so, why did she give me a pathetic smile and start to walk my way? This uneasy feeling would last throughout our relationship, but even so, she wouldn’t leave me alone. She constantly asked me to accompany her. A strange attraction kept pulling us together, like a pair of conspirators attracted to each other by their secrets--appealing but dangerous.

Her name was Jodie Fickle, and she lived up to her name. She was entirely lost without a man to take care of her, but the rewards she paid for your guardianship were generous and pleasurable. She was a nice girl, and I wasn’t a case of sacrificing herself; it was a happiness she freely gave.

For the next three years, we managed to go beautifully to the most lively parties. We dined and danced, flirted and fought, made up under the sheets. We had the time of our lives.

Then she told me she fell in love with someone else. I’d come to believe that our separation wasn’t possible, but she was married within the month. Though this came as a shock to me, I felt that I shouldn’t show my pain. I fell deeply in love with her, and her happiness was far more important than my own. So I had to let her go without any fuss.

I left to travel the world, running from a hurt I couldn’t escape. No matter where I laid my head down, I’d dream of those melancholy eyes and pathetic smile. They became my nightmares. Four years after I learned that Jodie’s husband died in a car accident 6 months prior, I was saddened by this news but felt hopeful. She’d need someone to take care of her again.

It was really not a good idea, but I had to see her. The urge wouldn’t leave me alone: it was like when you urgently needs to pass gas while at a formal dinner party. Letting loose means humiliating yourself, but you can’t stop yourself. I finally gave in and returned home.

Jodie happily accepted my request to see her. I showed up at her house for a drink, and we talked about old times. She looked exactly the same, and I felt the same strange attraction we shared--appealing and dangerous.

I settled on the idea of asking her to dinner as our conversation slowed and the reunion came to an end. Before I could ask, a tall, handsome man entered the room, holding the hand of a beautiful little girl of about 4 years old who had the same melancholy eyes and pathetic little smile. The only difference in those little-girl eyes was their color: hers were the same pale blue as mine.

Smiling innocently, Jodie introduced her new husband and her daughter to me, then bid me goodbye. I swiftly gave my regards and departed.
