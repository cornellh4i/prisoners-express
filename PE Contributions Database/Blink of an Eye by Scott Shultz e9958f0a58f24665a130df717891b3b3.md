**by Scott B. Shultz**

In the blink of an eye someone can die.

In the blink of an eye the wind can sigh.

In the blink of an eye the wronged ask why.

In the blink of an eye we cry.

In the blink of an eye we say goodbye.

In the blink of an eye baby birds learn to fly.

In the blink of an eye we try, we try.

Boom!

A blue sky turns black. We small the acrid smoke. We see the gray and brown dust. The heat from the fire warms our skin. We taste blood in our mouths. Our ears don’t work; they just ring. Until we hear the screams.

We scramble towards the vehicle we were just in. Yeah, that boom just blew me and my buddies right out of the armored Hummer we were in.

Snap! Snap! Snap! Boom!

We are being shot at. And someone just fired an RPG at us. My gun is up. I shoot back as I scramble towards my guntruck.

The dust is like a fog. I run through it. React to contact. Fire and weave. Fire and weave.

At the truck I realize I’m alone. My “we” is just “me.” There are bodies everywhere. My friends. I shoot at phantoms in the hills. I reload. I reach into the back of my guntruck and pull someone out. No time to look and see who. Don’t need to. It doesn’t matter. The body is limp. I run through fire and deliver it to our medic at the truck about fifty yards behind me. I run back. Shoot and weave. I grab another body and run through the fire again. I shoot, I weave. I run with a buddy, not a body, again.

And I go in again.

On a nice summer day in the mountains I got all of my buddies clear. None of them were dead. Injured but alive. Now they say I’m a hero. I’m not. Just looked out for my friends. Instinct. You don’t think in moments like that.

It all happened in the blink of an eye.
