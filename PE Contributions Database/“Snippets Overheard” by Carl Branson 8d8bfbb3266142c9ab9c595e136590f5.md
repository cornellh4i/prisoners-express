**“Snippets Overheard” by Carl Branson**

“Happy Anniversary Charlotte.”

“Oh Henry, when you suggested a trip down memory lane for our twenty fifth, I thought it would be a week of touring Savannah's high points.”

“Well sweetheart, that's still on the agenda, I just thought you would enjoy returning to the bar where we met.”

“It’s not only the same bar, but the very same table where we had our first drink together. How did you arrange all of this?”

“You remember Frank and Flo right?”

“They were the owners here when we met.”

“You’ve got it! We became friends but lost contact when I got that job in Silicon Valley.”

“I wonder how they are doing now. And, have to wonder how Billy turned out. “Remember how Flo went into labor right after we cut the cake at our reception?”

“How could I forget? Billy was born four hours later.”

“You still haven’t told me how you arranged this.”

“Well darling, the internet is a marvelous tool for finding persons, places, and things. Turns out Frank and Flo still own the place and Billy is their night manager. That good looking hunk tending the bar is Billy.”

“How do you know that?”

“Frank and Flo sent me pictures.”

“When did you first get in touch with them?”

“About two weeks before I suggested celebrating our 25th in Savannah.”

“So,you’re saying about 3 or 4 months ago. How could you keep that a secret for so long?”

“I had a lot of details to work out, not the least of which was getting the vacation time approved to coincide with our anniversary. On balance, it was better to make sure it was a surprise than to have you disappointed if something threw a monkey wrench into my plans.”

“And to think my parents still wonder how I could love you the way I do.”

“Ah! There’s Frank and Flo now. If Billy’s timing is as good as Flo claims, he should be arriving with the champagne at the same time his folks hit the table.”

Five flutes are filled with Frank, Flo, and Billy Raising the “Happy Anniversary” toast in unison.

After completing this celebrating toast, Frank announced that they had dinner reservation at his buddy’s five star rated restaurant and hustled everyone out the door.

Note: The title is misleading as this colloquy is pure fiction.
