Sometimes all that is left, the one thing that we can grasp and hold onto for just a little bit of hope when the light at the other end is dimmingâ€¦ Laughter. Lo, laughter has prevented countless suicides. The best medicine, they say, and perhaps there is much truth to that. Some days I find little to laugh about, yet always I try. Getting lost in a good book, listening to a nerdy NPR talk show, dreaming in the day, of the days of yore. If I place laughter in my path at every chance that I get, it helps my perspective on all other aspects of life, and to maintain a proper balance. Pay it forward. What do I do to encourage others to find laughter in their lives? Having a unique sense of humor, my jokes often fall on deaf ears, but this evening, I made a twenty second appearance at a table full of acquaintances and left them all in stitches with some good natured ribbing. In prison, some humor is often dangerous. It can be viewed as disrespectful, so we must know how others will take it especially in the presence of their homies, but a little bit of laughter goes a long way.
