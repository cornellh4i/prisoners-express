**“Close Call” by George Dominguez**

Boy! Do I remember that day. It was on a friday night. Me and some friends went out drinking’ and just havin’ a great time - playing pool talkin’ about some goodolf days- before gettin’ married.

We met some girls we’ve known since school. I have forgotten I had given my phone number to Molly. She called while I was at work but my wife never brought it up. My friend Luis came to my house friday evenin’ and asked me what I was doin’ Saturday? I told him nothing much maybe staying at home with the family and going to my people’s house. Why? He said remember we told the girls we’ll meet them at the club this Saturday. I totally had forgotten about that, so I told my wife that I was goin’ to Luis’s house and help work on his car. I could drop her at her people’s house. She said no, she’ll stay. So when Saturday came I already had my clean clothes in the trunk of my car. Right Luis was the only guy with us who wasn’t married and no girlfriend. He would tell us he likes being single. That way he could see whoever he wishes.

Anyway, we were all drinkin’, playin’ pool and I was talkin’ with Molly. She never told me either that she called my house. Then, we were dancin’ some slow music. Then, we went back to our table and I told them I’ll be right back. I need to put out a fire, take a leak. Joe came in and tole me “dude you’ll never guess who was here” I said my wife as a joke. He said “you told her we were here?” I told him “What are you sayin’ dude?” he said “some other ladies came in with your wife.” I told Joe “well let's see what she says.” So I walked out like nothing and went where she was and asked her what she was doin’ here and she asked me the same thing. So I told her well we were workin’ on Luis’s car. Then I told him dude let's go to the Peppermint Club. So now what are you and your sisters doin’ here? I told her I’m not doin’ anything wrong. Just drinkin’ playing pool and talkin’ about some good old days. But the girls had just left you. Molly used to be my girlfriend till we both went our separate ways. She told me she was about to get married with a guy who was already married. But they were livin’ separately. Yea I told Molly I was married but our marriage was on the middle of sayin’ “I quit”

No we never had any children. But that was a close call. I just didn’t want anything said or done to Molly and her friends.
