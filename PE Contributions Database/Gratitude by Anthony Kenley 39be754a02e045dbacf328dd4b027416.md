**Gratitude by Anthony Kenley**	

I want to express my gratitude to my dad, Jerry Kenley. I am so grateful to him for being a dad instead of just a father. Any man who helps create a child can be called a father, but a dad is something else entirely.

My dad became a single dad and a new widower in 1970. He was a dad to a five-year old boy, a four-year old boy, a two-year old boy, and a one-year old girl. This was 1970 and my dad was twenty-six with four very young children. Can you imagine? I’m sure he had trouble getting by.

My maternal grandparents told my dad he should “put us up for adoption.” “A man could never handle this situation.” “There’s no way that a single dad can raise four little children and a baby girl too.” Would they have said this to a woman?

My single-parent dad stepped up and made the decision to keep his family. My dad decided his love for his children wasn’t dependent on a wife. His love was unconditional.

My dad moved our family to Arkansas to be near his parents for a new start. He did not rely on my grandparents to raise us. We were soon in our own home.

My dad had to hire a babysitter, of course. He worked long hours then relieved the babysitter when he came home to us. My dad was there for us when no one else was. He went without so he could provide for his children.

My dad stayed up some nights and some days when we were sick. We cried for “daddy” when we were hurt or in need. Dad made countless breakfasts, lunches, and dinners for us. Dad was the birthday-cake baker and surprise maker.

Dad celebrated our accomplishments and helped us with homework. He took us to practices, appointments, school functions, etc. Dad even became a little league coach for us. He did all he could to raise a little girl right. She’s a well-adjusted mom of two kids now.

My dad never acted as if he considered himself extraordinary for doing a loving parent’s duties. These actions are expected of a parent, not just a mom. My dad eventually found a loving woman who would take on a ready-made family, but even then he remained a good dad.

Unfortunately, I never vocalized my gratitude to my dad about his many sacrifices and ever-enduring love for his children. He might never, in this world, know of my gratitude, but the world can know. My gratitude would make me nominate my dad for a “father hall of fame” if one existed. I appreciate my dad being a dad. My gratitude can only attempt to equate to his love.
