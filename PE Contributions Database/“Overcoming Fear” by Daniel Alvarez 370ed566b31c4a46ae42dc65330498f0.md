**“Overcoming Fear” by Daniel Alvarez**

Facing your fears is something that has to be done. Some psychologists say that procrastinating is a sign of fear. People become scared to do something (for some reason) so they procrastinate. When people say the word “fear,” I think of fighting, or people are scared to stand up for themselves, or what they believe in. I have seen people so scared they defeat themselves. So scared they never take that first step, or even worse: they’re so scared that every step they take is half-hearted and weak. That reminds me of what Franklin Roosevelt said, “We have nothing to fear, except fear itself.”

My name is Daniel, and the nickname that has followed me my whole life is “Daniel-son.” Because of the movie “The Karate Kid” from the ‘80s, I have taken Karate lessons. Since people call me Daniel-son, a stigma has manifested in my mind. I have to be strong. I have to be prepared for a fight. I feel I have to do the right thing and fight for a good cause. And since I know karate, I don’t believe in guns or weapons. So with that in mind, let me tell you that no fist fight will kill you. Take a karate class because you got to be prepared in life. Prepared like MacGyver. Prepared for Mortal Kombat.

It might sound like a cliche, but I’m 100% real. Living to be prepared isn’t just a hobby for me. I personally love overcoming my fears. Psychologists say there’s a function in the mind that is called, “Fight or flight.” I recommend both. You eventually have to fight, but there are times when you got to discern the situation and run. There’s a saying in an old Mario Brothers cartoon by the villain King Koopa: “Those who live and runaway, live to fight another day.” You got to remember Koopa will be back to fight another day. Just remember to come back prepared. You got to exercise and study martial arts. Boxing is good. Some of the best fighters I’ve encountered have been boxers. You don’t have to listen to the next sentence, but if you run away all the time, you end up living in a world of pretend. You pretend everything is fine. You pretend the people around you doesn’t see you as a coward or a loser. Take my advice to overcome your fears. Exercise, prepare, and study martial arts of boxing. Yet don’t go around making enemies with your fighting skills because you never know when your enemies will come back. Remember, karma is real, and so is the saying from Spiderman: “With great power comes great responsibility.”
