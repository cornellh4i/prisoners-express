**My Parents by: Tadd LeClaire** 

I only have a few moments before I depart.

I have a lot to say but where do I start.

Always superficial things whenever I spoke.

Nothing real, but this is real

I stand here before you to express how I feel

Pouring out my heavy heart because it’s too filled

And yet still, the love increases

Allow me to share the time my heart shattered to pieces.

My family shunned me, said I was the cause of Grandma’s death

My incarceration brought on too much stress, made her depressed

She went to lay down to rest, but never woke up.

Heard the news, got choked up. My heart broke up.

I beat myself in the head, like an egg my mind yolked up and scrambled.

I hate this part, can someone please change this channel

It’s more than I can handle.

I descend to my knees, desperately with a desperate need

I retrieve the scarlet shards of my heart, I’m desperate, please!

Hoping if I could put pieces back together

But each prick hurts worse than before

Like white hot pins pierced through each of my pores.

I suffer with every movement.

And I know I have to be strong enough.

I try to reach out to my family, but I guess my arm isn’t long enough.

I can’t blame how they feel.

I never intended to unintentionally kill.

The first woman we ever loved.

The last woman I ever hugged.

Grandma taught us to be kind and do right.

But I went down the wrong path on this cruel hike.

She disapproved, but still provided provisions

And now she’s no longer here due to my foolish decisions.

Tell me, why didn’t I listen.

Abandoned as a baby, starving and naked

In an empty, frigid apartment that was supposed to be vacant.

I only survived because a neighbor had heard my high pitched cry.

Grandma took me in and provided supplies, like food and pampers

But I wasn’t around when she got sick with cancer.

No matter what I do, I could never repay this debt.

I have to begin somehow, so I take baby steps.

I miss talking to my brothers, I love them till death!

But if that’s the price of my love, than I suppose hating me is best.

Six, five, four seconds left of Grandma’s last phone call

Now we are down to two.

She rushes to say “stay safe and I love you”

Before I had a chance to open my mouth, the phone cut out.

I don’t know if you can hear me now, but I hope you do

I just wanna say, I miss you grandma, and I love you too.
