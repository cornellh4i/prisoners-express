**Reunited by Austin Herald**

This one day back in my 20s I thought wouldn’t it be cool to find my birth-mom since I had been adopted at such a young age. I joined this website looking at all the adoptions where I’m from and noticed a date at the same hospital I was born in, except the request was for a girl, not a boy. I did research and found out she had no clue if she had a boy or girl. I contacted her by the website and waited for a response which took a while. She sent pictures of what I assumed was my biological brother whom I looked just like, except he had dark hair. I was blown away; could this be true? Really true? I didn’t want to get my hopes up until all the information was given out and put together. I knew my lawyer that did my adoption (friend of the family) so he could answer questions I needed. I contacted him and asked if he had my information about the name of my birth-mother. We came up with the same name linked together. Now she knows she had a boy and I know she’s a nice lady that gave me life. How the world turns and seems to always come full circle. The picture shows 1 million words said through life.
