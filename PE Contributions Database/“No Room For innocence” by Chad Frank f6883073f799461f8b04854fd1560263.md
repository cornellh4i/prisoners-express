**“No Room For innocence” by Chad Frank**

**Chapter 3**

Weekends were the busiest for Mama’s boys. There were two hustles: selling candy cars and washing cars, both of which were fronts for illicit activities. But out of the two, the car wash detail was the most desirable because most times, the boys only had to take off their shirts and rub their soapy bodies against the windows of men’s cars to get big tips.

As far as the candy bar beat? Only the rough trade worked it. And since it involved walking the streets-- often late at night-- the boys often got roughed up, or worse, constantly. Definitely not worth the risk-- especially considering half of their earnings went to Mama.

Roger was in charge of the car wash, which operated out of an abandoned Kmart. As a result, he wielded great power over the younger boys, who all vied for spots on his crew.

It was a sunny summer Saturday afternoon, which meant that the chickenhawks would be swarming; this meant more money. More money meant Mama would be happy. And when Mama was happy, everyone was happy-- especially Roger, who would get the biggest cut of the boys.

At first, Dayton watched from the sidelines, wearing his new sleeveless T-shirt, swim trunks and sandals, which Mama had bought him for just this occasion.

“Can I help? Please, please?” Dayton begged, when he saw the other boys splashing one another, seemingly having a good time.

Looking down at Dayton’s cherubic face, how could Roger say no?

“Sure. Go have fun,” he said.

Roger watched as Dayton grabbed a bucket, squealing in joy as the other boys soaked him. He looked like a newborn baby chick.

A beat-up rusty Nova pulled up. The driver motioned Roger over. The guy was a typical sleazeball: greasy hair, pockmarked face, and a mustache.

“What’s up?” Roger asked.

“How much for him?” the guy asked, nodding toward Darton.

“He’s not working.”

“Looks like he is to me.”

“He’s in training.”

What better a way to learn than the thought of what this guy would do with Dayton. Dayton was much younger than Roger when he had been initiated into this life. It had been a painful and traumatic experience for Roger, so surely it would be worse for Dayton. Roger still had nightmares about it, which he tried blotting out with dope, and he didn’t want Dayton to be doomed to a similar existence. When he looked over his shoulder, Roger saw Dayton having such innocent fun. No amount of money for dope was worth spoiling that purity.

“I tell ya what: I’ll give you a freebie.”

“Well, you ain’t him, but free is free.”

Roger climbed into the passenger’s seat and did his thing within eyeshot of Dayton, who splashed and romped, unaware of the depravity just feet away.

As always, Roger felt terrible afterwards. But knowing Dauton was spared the same indignities made the ordeal tolerable. Dayton’s presence alone brought in enough extra customers and tips. Mama would be more than pleased by this. And there was always the cellophane baggie of hope, and the cherubs that would sing to him from within.
