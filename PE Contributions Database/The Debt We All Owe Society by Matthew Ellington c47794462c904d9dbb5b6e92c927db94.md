**The Debt We All Owe Society by Matthew Ellington**

I believe in growth, in our personal responsibility to better ourselves. What I don’t believe in is the concept of rehabilitation, and I’ll tell you why. To rehabilitate is synonymous with to cure - to fix or repair from injury or disease. The implication is that there is something wrong with you, that you are broken and need to be fixed. To be cured. When you accept that, you accept someone else’s image of you in contrast to their image of a “perfect” world - one that offers comfort and freedom to a fortunate few, even as it offers empty promises to the vast majority of who continue to scrap, suffer, and bleed. In order to be a part of that world, they say, we owe A debt to society” - to be rehabilitated, to kill the parts of ourselves that they deem cancerous and unacceptable. None of us owes anyone that.

Instead, we owe it to each other to love, respect, and appreciate our innumerable differences as equally valid contributions to the shared story of our species.

We owe it to the disenfranchised - those shackled by the chains of oppression and inequity - that we accept as valid their experiences of suffering, that we lend our hearts, our minds, our strength and our common humanity, so that we may all one day stand, untethered, in the light of equality and justice.

We owe it to our children - and our children’s children - that we be better stewards of our world than those who came before.

But perhaps most importantly, we owe it to ourselves to grow, to learn, and to love ourselves enough to be able to craft this world into a dream of our own design instead of seeking to rehabilitate ourselves into someone else’s.

Whether you’ve been incarcerated or not, your debt to society can be no more - and no less - than this.
