**“Believe It or Not” by David M. Brown Jr**

Believe It or Not, prison isn’t a bad place. But then I guess that all depends on how you look at it, who you are, and what you call yourself [Prisoner, Convict, Inmate]. First, you have to accept responsibility for you crime, criminal addictive behavior, your temper, your addiction, or your defenses [if you took someone else’s charge]. And for those that are innocent, and “Believe It or Not” there are a few people that are innocent. [I’m not one of them]. But to the innocent: Stay Strong and Spiritually inclined, justice will prevail. Spiritual not as in a specific religion, but whatever doctrine that keeps you grounded and connected to your inner-self.

Who are you? “Believe it or not” some of us are still asking ourselves that question. And there’s nothing wrong with being lost. I will be 41 yrs young tomorrow, and I’m just now in the position of finding myself. The older you get, the younger you want to be, and when you’re young you want to be older. Funny, but true. Now in a position to find myself is not in relation to the physical, but the mental. “Believe it or not” some of us have heads as hard as the concrete we walk on everyday. And prison is the only place that we can sit still long enough to work on ourself. I once told my lady that I commend her for being able to change on the outside - her inside. If you think about what I just said, it makes a lot of sense and evidently she has more sense than me because she doesn’t need prison to change. But in my world - I do. We all start out as your mom’s baby. But who you become is up to you. Who are you?

Prison can be the place where you blame everybody for you being here, where nobody is here for you, where you don’t get fed right, where all the guards pick on you and nobody else, where it’s always hot - always cold, and everything else you can find to complain about. Or you can do the opposite and turn it into nothing but a positive experience with a little negativity, instead of all negativity with a little positivity. It’s up to you. It’s only as bad as you make it. Or as good as you make it.

I create my own lane and drive my own car. And I only allow certain passengers to get in my ride. And you have to be qualified and certified to ride. “Believe it or not” prison can be a great experience if you use it according to your plan. Your plan for release that is. See you’re doing two things right now whether you know it or not. You’re either preparing to go home, or you’re preparing to come back. You have to give yourself a chance in order to have a chance. Don’t waste your chance to change because if you’re not going to change you might as well give someone else your chance to go home because you’ll be back.

If you consider yourself a real convict then act like one. “Believe it or not”, it takes some prison time to become a convict. And as a convict, it’s our job to educate the inmates because for (1) someone did it for us real convicts and (2) they make it hard on us. We all know what I mean, from the guards to the game.

If you’re an inmate, wisen up and take notes. Everyone starts as a student, then one day the student becomes a teacher for another class. It’s a cycle, but don’t get caught in the recidivism cycle. Hopefully, you don’t have to do as much time as some of us to learn your Life Lesson, let this lesson be the start of your life and not the end. “Believe it or not”, it gets worse.
