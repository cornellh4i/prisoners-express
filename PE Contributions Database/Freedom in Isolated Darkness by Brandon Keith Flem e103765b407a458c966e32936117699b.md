**"Freedom in Isolated Darkness" by Brandon Keith Fleming**

Hello, my name is Brandon. Brandon Keith Fleming to be exact. Although, for this story, a name is not of great importance. No, in this story, it is the average. Every other fellow right alongside self that may or may not be able to relate to the epitomy or 1) abstract, summary 2) embodiment as the dictionary defines it. Of the thought process and/or mindset one has in any given set of circumstances. A fact or event that must be considered along with another fact or event. Here now, I did not set out beginning this writing to simply present the ideas or words of another as one’s own—as my own. No, plagiarize, plagiarism, plagiarist—whatever—was not my plan. I did not want to steal from Merriam and or Webster, though I must confess with this being simply my second “picture themes” writing and having viewed all the “picture themes” photos, it was this the second photo, due 9/1/15, that gave my mind the most anxiety.

Now that I’ve begun though, it is all very clear to me. Like my present set of circumstances, my cell could perceivably be compared to a dark, damp cell. Although, if I will only allow myself to escape, if only in thought even, I find that there is an entire world right there. Birds in the air, trees, an ocean. And yes, there are plenty of broken cement cinder blocks and overgrown weeds, shrubs, and bushes. But wait, I just witnessed a dove grab a branch from that olive tree and fly off into a new beginning, a new life. Hallelujah and Amen.
