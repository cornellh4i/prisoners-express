**“The Men in the Mist” by Vaughn Wright**

If you ever want to know what kind of job your imagination can do on you, do night sentry duty on a wooded mountainside when, instead of dawn, you end up with a dense early-morning fog. With only about ten feet of visibility to stare into, everything that you ever feared was under your bed or hiding in your closet as a kid starts to creep in. The big difference between being a kid and a soldier, of course, is that the Boogeyman is real, heavily-armed, and likely to have some friends with him when he comes to get you. Plus there’s no pulling the covers up over your heard, not when it’s your job, your duty, to protect the camp.

It was about a half hour after sunrise when I actually started seeing a shadowy outline of a hulking figure on our southern perimeter. It seemed to tear itself from the wispy tendrils of the fog as it entered our campsite. It walked upright on two legs but was not a man; it was two men. One of them was carrying the other across his shoulders. Both of them were Caucasian and wearing fatigues, and the one being carried was smaller and much paler.

The carrier was wearing a banded mask of some sort that covered the lower half of his grime-smeared face, like a muzzle. Around his neck was a metal collar with a length of heavy chain swaying from it. In his right hand was a double-barrel shotgun. He used his left to steady the man across his shoulder.

The carrier, he saw me. I know he saw me. He looked right at me and the P-26 pulse rifle I had trained on him since the moment I realized I had something to shoot. After that initial eye contact, he fixed his gaze ahead of himself and continued across the misty clearing of our camp like a possessed man. The only sounds were his labored breathing and the tramping of his boots upon the moist earth, and even those sounds were deadened by the fog.

In spite of our wearing the same uniform, the nearer he came to my post, the more I was reminded I was supposed to stop him, make him identify himself, yell a warning to the rest of my squad… say or do *something*. Only I felt as muzzled as he looked because even though it may have been my first war, I’d been fighting it long enough to have seen the look in his eyes. It said nothing--not me, not the enemy, not death--was going to turn him from his objective. I had him outgunned and still wasn’t fool enough to mess with that.

Without faltering or slowing, he reached the north side of camp where the fog swallowed him and his human cargo in its gossamer embrace as if welcoming them home. Almost as soon as they disappeared, I began to doubt I had even seen them. It happened so swiftly, so silently, so surreally. I *know* what I saw, though even if everyone else was still sound asleep and confident that I was doing my job to keep them safe.

Visibility was still crappy, but I stayed alert for anything else coming out of the south. If the chained man was being pursued, I’d handle it. In the meantime, the incident had at least given me something constructive to use my imagination on, like asking myself questions I’d probably never learn the answers to. Other than the chained man having obviously been a captive, was his pale companion a rescuer who himself ended up needing to be rescued? Was he even still alive? Where had they come from and where were they going? Why didn’t they stop and ask me for help?

Soon after the sun had burned the fog away and visibility was clear to the horizon, my relief showed up. I told her there was nothing to report, though I mentioned having a funny feeling about the southern tree line. I wasn’t going to admit I had let someone run through camp without raising an alarm or that others might follow, but I thought it best to put her on point, just in case.

On my way to chow, I at least learned the answer to the one question I needed answered more than any other. There were a set of boot tracks that cut right through the center of camp. They were fresher and deeper than all the others, realer than the others.
