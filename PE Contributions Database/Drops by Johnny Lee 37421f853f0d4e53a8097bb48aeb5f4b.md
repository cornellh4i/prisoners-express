**Drops by Johnny Lee**

Rain drops

Tear drops

Sweat drops

Fall from my face

Feet pound the pavement

As music pounds me ears

Blood pounds through my heart

As breath pounds my lungs

Arm swings through the air

As breezes fly through my hair

The sun peeks through the sky

As the rain drops stop

Tear drops

Sweat drops

Are all that remain

The sun gives me hope

To face another day

Sweat drops!
