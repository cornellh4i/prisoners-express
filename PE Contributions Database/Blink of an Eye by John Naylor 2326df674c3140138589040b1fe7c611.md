**“Blink of an Eye” by John Naylor**

How about a story of foolishness to lighten the mood? When I was a teenager we got books on how to build potato cannons at a gun show. Well I became comfortable with our cannon. One day I loaded it with a potato and had some skins left on the ground. I just figured I’d shoot them way from the house. It had a piezo igniter. I rested it between my feet. To keep the firing mechanism off the ground. Hairspray contains butane. Well I heard that click as I pushed those potato skins in. It was all like slow motion except for the dread. Like a slow motion blooper it came and shot me in the jaw. The flesh of my face irritated sme, a little welt effect. But despite raw mashed potatoes on my jaw I wasn’t knocked out.I didn’t lose an eye like a “Christmas Story”. I didn’t break my jaw. But Mom insisted I see Dr. Sangler. And he had to laugh at me. Of course, I knew better. Despite gun safety training and outdoor sports stupidity can still happen. Teach gun safety to the youth if you can and know how. Or encourage them to learn it from separate qualifications. This proves learning isn’t enough without application. Despite experience and safety lessons from knives to firearms. Let your guard down and tragedy can happen at the blink of an eye. You don’t want to give a wholesome sport more obstacles, bad press or hurt anyone’s right either. I hope so be careful about both word and action. It is a big world, but we still have to share it.
