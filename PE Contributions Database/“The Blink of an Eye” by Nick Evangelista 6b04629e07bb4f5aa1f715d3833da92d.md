**“The Blink of an Eye” by Nick Evangelista**

In 1988, at age 27, I joined the Navy. Prior to that time in my life, I was certain that I would be a rockstar. My high school life was put to the side while I pursued my next band or gig. My days in class were filled with daydreams of “making it” as a musician one day. Although my test scores indicated an aptitude well above my performance, I never set any goals to do well in school, only in music.

By the age of 23, I was finally at what I considered to be the peak of my musical career. I was part of a very talented local Minneapolis band who were playing in clubs every weekend with more opportunity ahead. Each of us, however, still had to work full time day jobs to live and eventually, burnout took its toll and we folded.

Three more years of working a dead end custodial job later, I met an Air Force Reserve officer who gave me the spark to enlist. My goals in the Navy were 3. Get a career, get some college education and financial help to do it, and finally to move to San Diego, away from Minnesota and the winter!

1988 turned out to be a very big year for me. Newly married in July, then off to Navy boot camp at Great Lakes Recruiting Depot near Chicago in November. Boot camp was relatively easy for me. I had a few years of life under my belt compared to the many other 18 and 19 year old recruits. As a result, I was placed in leadership roles almost from the start. Therefore, I avoided most of the menial tasks such as latrine or head duty and standing a 3 a.m. watch.

My younger brother at the time was in medical school and we spoke about the opportunities available in medicine. I chose and was selected to attend U.S. Navy Hospital Corps school after boot camp.

Motivated by the life waiting back home for me should I fail the academics and demands of Corps school, I did amazingly well. Graduating first in my class, I was offered the chance to attend an advanced school of Aviation Medicine. This would likely further my chances of being sent to San Diego.

The sun was indeed shining on me the day I received my orders to report as the new Corpsman for VF-111, an F-14 Tomcat squadron based in Miramar, just North of San Diego, California. I mean, San Diego, a fighter squadron based two hangers down from the world famous Top Gun school? To quote Eric Cartman . . . . . “Sweeeet!”

My 3 years with VF-111 were at the same time difficult and amazing. Difficult being away from home for as much as 6 months at a time, but amazing to see the world as I did.

Back in San Diego, I met the people who were also Corpsmen that trained Pilots and aircrew in Aviation Physiology and Water Survival. These were a very select bunch and there were only so many centers of training in the fleet. I applied for, was accepted to, and graduated from my next school as an Aviation Physiology Tech and Water Survival Instructor. I was then sent to Naval Air Station, Barber’s Point, Hawaii, to begin what I imagined to be the next phase of a long Naval career. Prior to leaving VF-111 in San Diego, I was decorated with a Navy Achievement Medal and promoted in rank for my performance there. In my eyes, the future in the Navy looked very bright to me and I had no reason to look elsewhere.

My life in Hawaii was nothing short of ideal. We lived in a large house, one mile from Ewa Beach, there was an abandoned World War II airfield near my house where my dog could run off leash and free, and my job duties included teaching water survival at the outdoor base swimming pool. The group of people I worked with were close and our families spent weekends at cookouts or camping right on the beach.

The physical demands of being an instructor in this field were well above many other sailors in the fleet. Therefore, a substantial part of our day was spent working out to maintain our physical readiness. My day typically started at 5:30 a.m. in the gym and also included an hour run or swim at lunch time. As you might imagine, we were in good shape. We had to be, given that our facility trained not only Naval Aviation personnel, but all the other special forces from all branches on the Islands. This included Army Rangers, Green Berets, Navy EOD (Bomb Squad), and even some Navy Seals.

The other side of our department’s training included the annual training of service members in the altitude chamber. The chamber simulated the conditions at high altitude and reinforced to all aircrew the dangers of hypoxia. Hypoxia simply refers to low oxygen levels in the bloodstream. At altitudes above 8,000 feet, oxygen was typically used via a mask by all aircrew. If a malfunction in the system that delivers the oxygen were to occur at altitude, anything from confusion to unconsciousness to even death could occur in mere minutes if they did not recognize the signs of *O2* deprivation.

The altitude chamber itself was a danger, as there was a small chance to suffer “the bends.” Similar to diving underwater, when the atmospheric pressure on our bodies changes, nitrogen gas comes out of solution and can and does circulate in our bloodstream. With normal, controlled ascents and descents in diving or flying, nitrogen typically returns to its harmless state. In some cases, however, it can lodge anywhere in the bloodstream and can cause anything from excruciating pain or even death if the obstruction occurs in the brain. For this reason, our center required that one or more of our staff be certified as a Navy Diver. In case of an emergency, that person would accompany the victim to the University of Hawaii’s dive chamber to treat them.

One of the divers at our center was due to rotate out and so we had to select someone to attend Navy Scuba School to take his place. I eagerly raised my hand.

Navy Scuba School is no joke. I was told to expect rigorous physical training that would challenge even the most fit individual. So with a couple months to go, I decided to increase my already strenuous regimen. That decision would prove to be the end of my Naval career, but the start of one even more challenging and fulfilling than I could ever have imagined.

The very next morning in the gym found my working out with the other Navy Diver in my command. I trusted him to coach me through what I needed to do to prepare me. We began the morning with some lunges. A common lower body exercise, nothing too hard or me and I thought nothing of it until the next day.

The following morning, I woke up with what literally was a pain in the butt. It wasn’t horrible then, but later in the day as I got out of the chair, it was as if somebody had stabbed me there. I made quite a scene in the office as I hobbled around like a man 50 years my senior. I thought nothing of it for about 2 or 3 days even though it didn’t subside and, if anything, seemed to intensify. Finally, I went to the base clinic where one of the doctors diagnosed me with a strained gluteal muscle . . . . . in English, I pulled a butt muscle. At this point in my medical career,  I knew some things, but not enough to understand what this was that had happened to me and now threatened my goals to finish dive school.

Daily life wasn’t too awful. As long as I was on my feet or upright and moving I was fine. However, the minute I sat in a chair or a car, or tried to get up from bed, the pain was incapacitating. By that time 3 months later, 2 other Navy Doctors had seen me, diagnosed a gluteal strain, placed me on light duty and there I sat, or tried to. I missed out on dive school and because of my injury, was taken off of flight status. In a matter of months, I went from top physical condition to riding a desk.

The initial injury was in October. By February, 5 months later, the pain was now in my left leg and foot. I could not sleep in a bed and most nights walked the floors until I was so exhausted, I could actually get 10 minutes of sleep. Not on a bed, mind you, a hard tile floor.

Finally, 5 months later, miserable and at my wit’s end, I was given an answer to my problem. Unable to move one Saturday, with no Navy Doctors available, I went to see a local civilian chiropractor. After a mere 5 minutes, he told me I most certainly had a herniated disc in my spine pressing on a nerve that runs down my left side. I now was developing some mild weakness in my foot. That, coupled with the failure of several doctor visits and ER visits to diagnose the issue over the last 5 months, prompted the chiropractor to insist I see a surgeon ASAP.

One week later, I’m in the neurosurgeon’s office. The next day, an MRI of my spine is done, which showed a huge herniated disc which was indeed pressing on a nerve that controls part of my left leg and foot. The next week, I underwent surgery to address the issue. Surgery went well and I woke up with a numb foot but no leg pain for the first time in 6 months. I was very pleased.

I was sent home to recover. Off work entirely for 4 weeks, then back to desk work for a while. I was eventually able to do some swimming again despite some fairly persistent leg pain. Overall, the surgery helped the worst of the discomfort but not all.

18 months after the surgery despite PT medications, 2 more MRIs and no return to full duty, I was diagnosed with Battered Nerve Root syndrome. The severity and duration of my condition resulted in an improvement but an incomplete ability to recover.

During my year and a half of recovery, I met a Navy Physician  Assistant. He talked to me at length about the career and I was excited and hopeful to pursue it. I took as many college courses as I could at night and on the weekends until I finally separated from the Navy in 1994.

I returned home to Minneapolis and enrolled in a Pre-Med type course designed to fulfill the requirements for application to their PA Program. The work ethics I learned in the Navy served me well. I had become a very capable student, finally determined to apply myself to the coursework.

I was accepted to the PA Program in 1995 and graduated with honors in 1998. Despite my current situation, I am proud and thankful for my 26 years in medicine. These were, at the same time, the most difficult and most enjoyable of my life.

The prompt for this journal project is The Blink of an Eye. I believe my blink occurred in that Hawaiian gym, early one October morning with a barbell of weights on my shoulder. All of that led to what I’ve just described. None of which would have happened without the lunge.
