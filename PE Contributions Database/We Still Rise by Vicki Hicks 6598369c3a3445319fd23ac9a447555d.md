**We Still Rise by Vicki Hicks**

I guess some things always seem out of place with time. I have always seen you as a valuable friend, person, mother, etc.. For what it is worth, you were always sweet to me. Things change and days change. Seasons began to form, and people developed their own way of doing things in life. I think we all remain the same deep down inside. It is like we are all little kids in many ways just moving through this world searching for our place. Writing our history on the way and just being grateful for fresh air. It is not about circumstances or the situations in our life now, but what we truly feel deep within the core of our soul. I remember years ago I met this beautiful person. Not much has changed, just the circumstances. It will always be this journey and nothing more. This is part of the process. The concrete will not prevent the seed from growing.The flower will not wither. It must remain strong and live for something. The divine journey must continue. People need your soul again. People need you in so many ways. We have not forgotten about the person. We are waiting outside to feel unconditional love forever in a day.
