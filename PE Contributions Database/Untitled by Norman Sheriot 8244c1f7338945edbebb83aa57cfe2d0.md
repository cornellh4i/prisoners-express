With age comes wisdom and the ability to see through the games that cons play on unsuspecting others. Wisdom is knowledge through experience.

We learn to see without really looking. We know our surroundings and adjust to changes, even the most subtle. This is our survival mechanism. When one is aware of what’s around him he is prepared, and that in itself is tantamount to survival in this dog eat dog environment.

In here we cannot just leave to get away from situations. We learn to see through the haze of projected mannerisms. To see that even a rose in its splendor and beauty has thorns that can draw blood. We find that when someone says “You can trust me!” to not trust them. Trust isn’t asked for, it is earned and is easily lost.

Predators are everywhere here, we must see through the lies, the game and the cons. But with patience we learn to see people for what they are, good and bad. We learn to be alert, to be aware, and of most importance, to be aware of our surroundings at all times, ready to react at the drop of a dime. Survival mandates this.
