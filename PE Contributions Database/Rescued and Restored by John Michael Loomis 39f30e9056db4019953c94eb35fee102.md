**Rescued and Restored by John Michael Loomis**

I never thought getting locked up would be a blessing that saved my life, but it’s true. I was so deeply lost in darkness and addiction, pretending to be happy so no one noticed my downward spiral. Then one drug-fueled, alcohol soaked night, a misunderstanding and fight ended in horror as I killed another young man, and at age 22 I was incarcerated and charged with 1st degree murder. It took a few weeks to fully detox and sober up, and I could hardly sleep, haunted by what little I could remember of what happened. I was scared, feeling alone, and not sure I could continue. But my amazing mother reminded me of God’s unfaltering love, unrivaled strength, and undeserved kindness and mercy, and that helped spark my path to redemption. With His help, I got clean and sober, began to check and change my violence and anger, and focused on learning and growing, so I could help others. I’ve had some slips and falls along the way, but I’m over 6 years sober now, 13 years into a life without Parole sentence, and I have hope and a sense of purpose. I’ve helped several people find sobriety, a few more find peace and purpose, and now I’m trying to be a voice of strength for survivors of sexual assault and abuse. (Too much victim blaming and stigmatizing has gone on in our society, and I think it’s time for change!) I am grateful that I was rescued from chaos and destruction, and will continue to strive to help others find peace, serenity, and hope. Reach out, take my hand, let’s take this journey together!
