**“Wilderness” by Giles Belcher**

Wow! What a beautiful sight to behold! The trail that I’ve been walking to for the past two and half hours! It’s a warm and sunny day thus far. I’ve seen grizzly bears, elk, mules, deer, and a mountain lion! That mountain lion, I almost missed it if I hadn’t slowed down at glassing the treeline. A lot of tracks, scat, trails and such I’ve seen. I’ve enjoyed being out in the wilderness for the past 2.5 hours. I truly have! Poplar, aspen, cedar, oak and pine trees, all of which I’ve seen and examined. The stream bed must have been here for ages? It looks like a glistening ribbon coming down from the mountain. Some snow is still on the mountain! How many Indians and mountain men must have been here and lived their lives in this area? Are there some fish in deeper pools further down the stream? I’ve spotted some eagles, hawks and vultures floating on the thermals into the sky! It’s hard to tell if anyone has been her taking in the view that’s spectacular. The sky is blue with clouds of various shapes of dark and light hue. Is the weather possibly moving in? I might need to either turn around and go back towards safety, but I’ve got plenty of gear and food to stay out here for a couple of days. This peaceful and awe-inspiring wilderness is postcard-picture perfect! This is life at its best as far as I can tell! I just need to do this more often. I believe I’ll be back here sometime soon! I hope I’ll be able to return here soon and see so much more. The air is crisp and so refreshing. It’s so much better than being in the city; that’s for sure. This wilderness view that will stay in my mind for a long time to come… Maybe, I’ll tell someone about this wilderness view. I guess I’ll just enjoy what I can for the time I have! How about you?
