**“It’s Surreal” by John Naylor**

Sitting here now I watch her. At this moment. I can’t tell her how much I love her. She’ll never understand. My smile doesn’t betray my emotions.

They told Mom she’d never have children. She prayed and never gave up, so she had two. That’s more than a Gospel measure. God did what man said could not be.

I think of my recorder, a yamaha I played in Beth Jones’ music class. In high school it was a Butch Hall Native American courting flute. I never fully applied myself to either as I should’ve. Though I liked that G minor Native American courting flute, I didn’t reach its full capabilities.

Story of my life, could’ve done more with incarceration itself: the time wasted when I could’ve served others. I could’ve been a better example at 20 even.

I won’t focus on intelligence and maturity wasted. I know what is now. I know my daughter stands before my tired body. I know this isn’t everything. If she sounded like a dick in a fight with a mountain lion, I couldn’t, couldn’t say an unkind word. I came so far. So much I went through. I’m hanging onto the moment. I want to hold her. Tell her how much God loves her. Share some verses so she never forgets. I long to see my wife deep in my bones. This hurts so bad. I can feel she’s near. But I know that my daughter wants to impress me with her practice and ability.

I feel a shift coming. My wife over my shoulder too far to reach. I know she feels joy to see us together and she doesn’t want to interrupt. The shift is coming soon.

*Please come over,* I think hard as to will it if possible. I want to hug them both. The shift brings me to a new message, a new “reality”. Praise God in his infinite grace and mercy. Thank you God, just a bit more!

The timeline moves. I know I’ll go somewhere else in another layer of time and reality. I have to leave them again. Even if it’s prophetic and I’ll eventually wake up in prison. On an A/S unit, Administrative Segregation, until when? I don’t know. I’ll be kept from contact cists and my brother Wayne.

He’s doing Bible studies and getting As. A+ guy with growth. So blessed to have a part in that. Others need prayer too. He’s my second longest running prayer to come back to God. I’m furthering the Great Commission as Jesus taught. The things I missed, all the wasted time on selfish endeavors. I know I could’ve been a statistic for the legal system. I could say I am now. Would you accept that? Could you? With everything wrong, 120.5 years? I really hope not. I’ll never stop trying to meet the problems in life. Even if they’re not mine. I yearn to call out to dry bones. We call out to dry bones come alive. If only you had the Holy Spirit moving in you, ACts 2:38. Nothing is impossible with God. Philippians 4:13. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”
