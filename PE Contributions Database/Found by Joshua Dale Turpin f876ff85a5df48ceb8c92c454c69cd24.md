**Found by Joshua Dale Turpin**

****They say after you take a life, it’s a heavy burden. What about multiple lives? That’s an even heavier best to wear. Sometimes, life calls for an automatic and traumatic cease of existence. Sometimes, it’s under circumstances. Sometimes, you have to shed blood to spill blood. It’s the balance of life. At some point in life, everybody stops and asks themselves, when is enough enough? When is too much too much? Violence, drugs, money, and murder are costs. As I look at these four walls, I can finally understand the outcome of fatality. I find myself asking, who are you? Why are you? What are you? Who is this man in my reflection? The only answers I can think of is still a long shot… Who am I? Why am I? What am I? I can’t even begin to explain who I am without explaining what and who I’ve been, and portrayed myself to be. A robber, bad influence, a thief running blind in the night, drug dealer. Somebody who strived by all means to keep food on the table and shelter over my head. No, society doesn’t understand that part. I’ve shot guns, some with and without a special name on the bullet. I’ve turned on family, friends, and those who truly cared about me. I’ve disrespected people who only gave me respect. I’ve looked down on cowards, preyed on the weak. I’ve hung with the relist, lied, cheated, stole, and abuse. I was all of the above. I am all of the above.

I have become the one to use these four walls and put my head into the books to obtain the knowledge to be successful in the real world. Some people might profile or call me a “beast,” a “criminal,” or a “menace to society,” but once again, not everybody experiences the same experiences as everybody else. They say you’ve got to live to learn and obtain knowledge to separate fact from fiction. These four walls have changed me, hardened my heart, and frozen my emotionless soul. I’ve become both part of my environment and the person I adopted to be. I am the struggle.

I am all of the above and am still not fully found. I am the come up. I don’t owe my past an apology as much as I owe my future a chance. Still, I look in the mirror and ask myself every day, Who are you? Why are you? I tell myself you can’t be explained, only experienced. You are you. But am I found? Am I found?
