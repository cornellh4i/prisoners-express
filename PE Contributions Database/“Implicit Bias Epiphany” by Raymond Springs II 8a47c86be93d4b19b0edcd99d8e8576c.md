**“Implicit Bias Epiphany” by Raymond Springs II**

Bo O’Cannoylle, a 67 year old retired Sea Captain of the Merchant Marines and philanthropist from Kennebunkport, Maine, watched “White Like Me,” a racially-conscious documentary produced and narrated by Tim Wise. O’Cannoylle created this photo as a symbol in response to the documentary, and he blogged the following rant:

“I have prided myself on not being racist my entire life, on being a spokesman for equal opportunity, and being my own thinker--not a mind controlled cyborg. TOday, I sit with face in my hands with a new powerless feeling that I haven’t had a thought free of influence my entire lifetime. I recognize that I am and have always been a social, economic, or political pond for the agenda of hidden leaders, drivers, and fabricators of this American society. Experiencing a false sense of freedom, justice, and equality, I ask each person to search their mind’s memory bank and honestly ask themselves: ‘Have I ever had a free thought, one that wasn’t introduced from a source outside of myself? One that wasn’t laced in my mind by the influence of curriculum, environment, or necessity?’ Then I want to challenge you to watch this video documentary by Tim Wise, ‘White Like Me.’ Question if you have benefitted from being a member of the white race due to some level of systemic, unmerited favor? Because at age 67, I watch the daily news reprt about police murdering black men and women at a fever-pitched rate without being held accountable, and I check the statistical facts about the prison pipeline and mass incarceration and conviction rate of blacks and latinos, versus those of whites in the same time periods and same crimes.

“You won’t fail to see how we have benefitted from the whiteness of our skin in this so called Free Society. Because of the aforementioned events, I created this picture as a symbol for Implicit Bias in hopes that it will be adopted by all honest, white Americans who have came to the same conclusion as me and want to stand united with other races. Let us take to the streets wearing t-shirts with this symbol printed on the front and the words ‘Implicit Bias’ on the back. Let’s march in support of ‘Black Lives Matter’ and ‘Reparations’ and ‘40 Acres and a Mule.’ Let us take our movement to the House floor, challenging them to take action on behalf of us white Americans unwilling to pretend that this unfair treatment isn’t occurring--unwilling to be a party to the plight of Blacks in this society.
