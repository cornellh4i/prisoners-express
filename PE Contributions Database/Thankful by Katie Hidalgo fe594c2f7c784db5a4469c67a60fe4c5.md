**Thankful by Katie Hidalgo**

As Thanksgiving day approaches, many of us will reflect on what we are thankful for in our lives. Perhaps it is family, friends, health, life. Whatever it is. We are thankful for, we will think about it this time of year.

I recall that during my grade school years, we were often given composition assignments to complete during our thanksgiving break. The inevitable question was: “What am I most thankful for?” Most students wrote about their families, pets, or friends, while a few others wrote about their video games. Myself, I usually mentioned my material possessions (i.e. books, games, toys, etc. most often, my beloved books), or perhaps a song I found moving. My teachers did not miss the fact that I made no mention at all of my family or friends, and often pointed this out to me, and I would either shrug it off as of no consequence, or else storm off in a rage.

You see, during most of my childhood, I was living in foster homes, being shuffled around so much it would make a blackjack dealer’s head spin. Though, I was permitted frequent visits and phone contact with my biological family, I was away from them more often than I saw them. The reason why I was shuffled so much-unbeknownst to my family and social workers- was because I was “difficult” to take care of. The difficulty stemmed from my anger at the physical and most often sexual abuse I suffered from my “caregivers”, and their charges or their own families, all because I was feminine coming from a predominantly muslim family, this was a hard pill for them to swallow, particularly when i revealed I am transgender.

As for friends, I much preferred company of a good book to any human companionship though I did have friends who were similarly introverted.

Since coming to prison. I have endured many hardships, especially after coming out (no, it was not because of prison or my past, but because i truly feel this way). It only took so long because I feared losing my family which I did. I have since been raped, harassed, and discriminated against- and so much more. With all the pain I have endured, my only thought had been that there us nothing to be thankful for- until now.

All my life, the only thing I truly desired in life had eluded me. I sought it, but it kept evading my grasp. What is this I speak of? It is love. I am not talking some touchy, feely,sentimental type, but true love. My parents frowned upon public displays of affection, I had not witnessed what it looked like, I only knew it existed., and i needed and wanted it. Just when I thought it was hopeless, and was about to give up, I fell in love with self less, wonderful man who is in love with me as well. He has shown me what love is by his daily actions. He has helped me to see that love is not something we can force, but instead comes naturally and spontaneously. He has helped me realize the beauty I had denied while so many people saw it. He has lifted the veil off my eyes and showed me the beauty in life in all its splendour. And I am so thankful for him. Never before did I imagine I would find something like this, but here it is . granted, I am still a bit rough around the edges, and I am still broken, but with him by my side, and in my life, I will be whole again. Hell, I am whole again, I just need some polishing.

So, if I were assigned the same composition today, an answer to the question : “What are you most thankful for?” I would instantly begin:

I am most thankful for my husband, Abel Hidalgo.
