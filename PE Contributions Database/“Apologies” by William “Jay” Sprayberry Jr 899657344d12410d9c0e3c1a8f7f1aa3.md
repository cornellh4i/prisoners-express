**“Apologies” by William “Jay” Sprayberry Jr.**

****We all utter apologies every day. It’s natural to be sorry for things we’ve done wrong. Every human being makes mistakes, and every human with a heart filled with love, admits his or her mistakes, and apologizes.

An apology is all we have really. It’s the only thing we can do to make up for a mistake, or to try to right a wrong in some cases.

Of course you have a choice to apologize or not. You can be stubborn and never admit your wrongdoing, but who really does that hurt? Mostly you I’d say.

How many families have been split apart just because two people were too hard headed to say two words. Two simple words that can make all the difference in the world. “I’m sorry.”

Parents have gone years without talking to an adult child just because they didn’t agree with something that happened in their life. Maybe the kid grew up to get involved with drugs. Maybe they didn’t become a doctor or lawyer. Maybe they just borrowed a car and wrecked it and couldn’t afford to repair it.

Have you ever been with someone you loved and just stopped talking to them because of something that happened between the two of you? Maybe you disagreed on how you were raising your children. Maybe you argued and said something you didn’t really mean. Maybe you cheated on each other even though you really loved one another and regret it, but you just can’t bring yourself to say you’re sorry.

Why? You did play a part in it didn’t you? Even if it was all their fault, are they really worth so little that you can’t just swallow your pride and say those two words?

“I’m sorry.” If you are reading this out loud, then you already just said it. Why not say it to the one who needs to hear it? Do you really feel like you're accomplishing something by saying nothing?

As the days pass, you don’t get more life, you get less. Every second you hold those two words in is a second lost. You can’t get that back. It’s one second closer to the end. For both of you.

Imagine waking up tomorrow. You go to work and your boss tells you that you have a call on line two. You pick up the phone. When you think back on this later, you’ll remember every second of this. Almost as if you lived it in slow motion.

“Hey buddy,” the person on the other end of the line says. “I hate to be the one to break this to you, but he or she passed on today.”

Congratulations. You won. You never had to apologize and now you never will. How do you feel? Was it worth it?

Now you’ll never have to say you’re sorry, and you’ll never know what could have been. Life will go on, but most likely you’ll always have that empty spot in the place where love could have been instead, because you’ll always wish you’d have just done it. Said two words. “I’m sorry.”

The question now really is who do you want to be? The person picking up that phone at work, or receiving that letter in the mail saying they’re gone, or the person who says two simple words that can maybe rekindle a relationship? Is there someone in need of one of your apologies today? Maybe they’ve been wanting to say it too. You can be the bigger man or woman. Just say it before it’s too late. Even if they reject it, you’ll know you did everything you could and that’s more than your doing now. “I’m sorry.”
