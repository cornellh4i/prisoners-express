**“Pueris Rex” by Mark Brown**

Without sex

(Well, it’s there, no need to look)

Without hair

(There too but just for show)

The Potential claim

In us their domain.

Trailing no glory

They abide

Trailing nothing save

All that’s gone before

Their small embodiments

Best us unbeknownst

To them.

Yes, they wield a fetter,

Its name:

“You should know better.”

But because you don’t,

There are prisons,

Princesses, and

Das Kapital.

But all is in all

(nothing’s empty)

And we enthralled

(Something’s given)

Say to them,

Endlessly,

“Come on!”

Harpy and harlequin,

They are not blind:

Their shadow’s recursive

And it stings

But-without mouth

Nor-couth-mercifully,

It sometimes also

Sings.

Mark L. Brown “Marktha”
