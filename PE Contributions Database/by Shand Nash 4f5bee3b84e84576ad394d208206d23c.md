**By Shand Nash**

It’s 1980, the bloodiest election ever in Jamaica. With the country divided into two faction(s): Jamaica Labor Party (J.L.P.) and the People’s National Party (P.N.P.). What I saw was so horrendous. At five years old going to the store for my mother; was a grotesque image of two burnt bodies hugging each other. A mother and her off-spring (could not determine if it was a boy or girl). I asked my mother what happened. Her response: “ We live in a J.L.P. area and P.N.P. have killed over ten people, just last night.” I heard that they are raping the females and killing the males. No matter their age. I asked about what I saw. She hugged me, whilst whispering in my ear, “They told her either they come out of their dwelling (made out of ply board and zinc roofing) to get gunned down or burnt to death.” Thereafter, I knew the choice that was made.

It’s 1990 now. I’m fifteen, but the memory still lingers. I go to the Don (an individual that’s a gangster who runs the community) and told him that I want to de- the elderly and young. He gives me a nine millimetre and says prove myself. Take in mind that I never fired a gun before. I walk up the street to gun down a P.N.P. I see one. I fired crazy, not aiming or anything. He falls. I’m running back to my community now. When I’m about to reach my lane. I’m confronted by police. The rules: **If police see you with a gun-kill them. ****I fire again, but with precision. Because I’ve seen them kill innocent people. I made my escape to the Don. Whilst I’m trembling like a leaf. The Don smiles at me. This is the beginning of something that will forever haunt me.

To be continued. Is it a story?...Hmph!... My mother slapped the taste out of my mouth, when neighbours told her what I did.
