**Clothes by Jack Simpson**

The day came that our tan uniforms would be a thing of the past. We were given bright orange pants, shirts, and sheets. Still waiting on the pillow cases. Everything that once was white is orange now. Our walls took on a new hue. Well when cleaning is done everyday. It is losing battle. No matter how much we sweep and wash down the walls. It still somehow finds a way to get under the beds.

Ajax works well since it will remove some and get down in the cracks of the walls and floor. I cleaned at home but there wasn’t that much dust, like here. When the sunlight used to come through the windows. You could see the dust floating in the sunlight in the bay areas.

The south has two orange teams people pull for. One is the Clemson Tigers and the Crimson Tide. One in South Carolina while the other is in Alabama. I'm not big on football. I do love the Super Bowl. Our orange lets us stand out in a crowd. The security staff can see us at night now and it doesn't bother me. If you aren’t doing anything wrong, then you have nothing to worry about.

When I went on a visit, I told my family to look for a bright orange pumpkin and they would see me. When I got near the table, I couldn’t help it. I had to laugh and they also smiled as I sat down. My sister said it isn’t too bad. I do have to agree, after a while it grows on you. It isn’t the clothes that make the man, it is the man who makes the clothes work for him. I will always wear my clothes with pride, even if it is from the prison system.

I can and will walk with my head held high and think about the others in the world who would give all they have to wear clothes that are new and bright. I wore good clothes on the street and it wasn't always like that. I do remember walking by stores in my home town and looking inside through the window. Only to be run away from the glass.

There is always a brighter side of life and the things we go through. It will help build a better person. We all are really fortunate in a way. We could be walking around in HOT PINK! That would have really stood out.
