**“Grey Shot” by Charles Agnew-Toland**

Mountains peak, arching upward in an attempt

To caress the once azure sky,

Just like this mountain I, too, wanted to stand tall,

But the torrential rain beat upon my brow for

Far too long.

I prayed to God with no answer for so long

So now I say fuck him cause he was never there all along.

My inspiration now is found in coffee cup after cup,

Though some people see what I drink as mud.

Yet, like the mountain, I stand resolute and unflinching.

For inspiration comes from me, not

Above.
