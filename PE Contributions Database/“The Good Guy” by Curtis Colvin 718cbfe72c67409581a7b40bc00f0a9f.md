**“The Good Guy” by Curtis Colvin**

Why am I like this? Always a sucker for helping those who get in trouble. Here I am, on my way to the prison planet Skullac, when we have to make an emergency landing on some world we know little of. There’s sand, dust, low visibility, and barely enough oxygen to breathe.

After two hours of repairs, everything is silent No banging, cussing, or talking, and I’m wondering why. So I get up out of my seat, chains dragging (oh, I didn’t tell you I’m a prisoner… sorry) and looking around. I get to the hatch, and visibility is zero. I notice a face mask and rifle at the bottom of the ramp. I left the other 10 prisoners, went down the ramp, and picked up the gun and put on the mask. 10 feet to my left was a pair of boots. As I got closer, I saw that they were attached to a guard’s legs.

All of a sudden, I saw a flash of something going by: it was light-colored and moved on four legs. It was about the size of a horse. I grabbed the guard, threw him older my shoulders, and returned to the aircraft. All of the other prisoners were at the opening, watching. I had to back them up with the rifle and told them to sit back down. As soon as that happens, I shut the hatch. Before it closed all the way, a giant eye looked in through the crack. It had an intelligent, evil look.

The guard woke up coughing and disoriented, telling us about what happened. How something grabbed his partner while knocking him airborne before he passed out. About then, he noticed me with his rifle. I told him not to worry because I wasn’t going to hurt him.

Luckily, the repairs were made to the spacecraft before everyone started disappearing. We waited a few scarey hours to see if anyone else was going to show back up. Then we fired up the craft, left orbit, and talked the guard into dropping us off in exchange for his safekeeping.

To this day, I still don’t know what planet that was or what were the inhabitants that lived there. I do know one thing: because of the pit stop, I am free of prison bars.
