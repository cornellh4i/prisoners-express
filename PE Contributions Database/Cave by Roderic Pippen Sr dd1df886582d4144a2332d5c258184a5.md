**Cave by Roderic Pippen Sr.**

This cave represents my mindstate of how I saw the world. Coming from the Eastside of Detroit, I didn’t think I had many options. My neighborhood was drug infested and nothing was given to anyone. So I made a choice to go get what I wanted. If it wasn’t in my cave, it was out there for me to take.

My parents were addicted to drugs, so money was scarce. If I wanted something I had to go out and get it myself. As a kid I started out stealing video games and Pokemon cards. But as I grew so did my attention span and what I placed value on.

Girls would end up being my biggest motivator, but I would never allow them in my cave. I saw my mother leave my father, and hurt him beyond measure. That lesson taught me to never let a female have the ability to hurt me. So I continued to take what I needed to be able to interact with the females. As I got older my criminal choices became more of a lifestyle.

But going through all that I have, my cave is no longer my home. I have the potential to do whatever I want in the world outside my cave. So now this picture represents me stepping out of my dark past and taking a step into the light of the world.
