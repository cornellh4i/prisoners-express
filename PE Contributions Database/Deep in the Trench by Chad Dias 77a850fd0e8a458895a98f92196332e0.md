**"Deep in the Trench" by Chad Dias**

At the time, I was simply too young to fully understand what it meant to be “deep in the trench”. Merely a boy, of course I appeared fearless, oblivious to the danger that lurked all around me. It wasn’t until danger had found me that I truly knew what it was that I should fear. Now, several years passed, as a grown man, I honestly can say that I understand the literal and metaphorical sense of what is meant to be “deep in the trench”. Although it is a crumbling experience to endure, I’ve weathered the forge of trial and tribulation, humbly tempered through the highs and lows. Only the LORD knows what the future will hold. However, I am ready for whatever awaits. Strengthened by my faith, I know that this too shall pass, and the next time I am faced with the fortuitous circumstance of being deep in the trench again, I know that it will be a learning experience worthy of remembrance.
