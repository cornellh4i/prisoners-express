**“Helping Out” by Yankee Lawyer**

I’m from New England. I was raised in a good Christain family, trained to help my relatives, friends and neighbors. Wherever I go, I try to help my community, and to leave a place better than it was when I found it.

I used to help old ladies across the street, blind people onto trains and buses, and poor people out of debt. Now I’m in the dirty dirty South, trying to get someone to help me get out of prison.

I came to North Carolina to protect some people who were in trouble. I learned that the Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina is a major center of human trafficking and one of the world’s leading producers and consumers of child pornography. Tens of thousands of children needed my help; but I was only one man raging against a powerful machine.

Perhaps some of the values I used to think of as American were really just Yankee values. I have been suffering culture shock since I crossed the Mason-Dixon line.

I am starting to understand why inmates in Southern men’s prisons don’t stick together. Most Southern prison inmates are descendents of slaves, bred and trained to serve White masters. Why is no one on the outside lifting a finger to help us?

I thank God for Prisoner Express and a few other organizations that help out in narrowly defined missions of mercy and compassion. Once (for over 57,000 years), there will be one again. I continue to try to help others out when and where I can.
