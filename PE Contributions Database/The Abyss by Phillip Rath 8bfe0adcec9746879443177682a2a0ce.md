**The Abyss by Phillip Rath**

Spencer stood on the precipice of the Abyss, having wandered for days through the enchanted forest. It was time to make up his mind: to enter the Abyss and encounter the unknown, or turn back and forever abandon the opportunity. Life only offered you the one chance to explore the Abyss. Turning back was to remain with the known while missing your chance of discovering great things, amazing creatures, or even riches beyond imagination, or life threatening obstacles, destitution or nightmares even Steven King was at a loss to describe.

On the other hand, he walked around the homeless man begging for spare change as he walked his dog, and noticed the ramshackle homes with rusted out cars in the yard on the other side of town. Could he live with himself if this was the payoff to his tossing of the dice?

So far, life had been the result of Spencer’s own decisions, through his own efforts.

Spencer stood at the entrance to the Abyss, contemplating all that he knew, or thought he knew, about what he would face should he choose to enter.

There was no one else to confer with. There was no advisory committee to consult. There was only Spencer, alone with himself, his knowledge and his life experiences.

After deciding, then changing his mind, only to reconsider, Spencer finally decided his only course of action was to …
