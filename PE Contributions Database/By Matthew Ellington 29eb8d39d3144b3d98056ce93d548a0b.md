**By Matthew Ellington**

I am infected by the blossoming fields

Beyond the sterility of wire fences and concrete walls

Insulation from a world of sprawling, beautiful malignancy

That world crawls to life under translucent rays

Feeding and spreading their warmth and freedom

Like a rash that consumes my thoughts

I grow cold from the distance

A chill swear in the darkness as I imagine

The embrace of the grass beneath me

The caress of a breeze as it sidesteps the trees

Infusing my lungs with their therapeutic vapor

Menthol to my soul;

Spring fever is catching.
