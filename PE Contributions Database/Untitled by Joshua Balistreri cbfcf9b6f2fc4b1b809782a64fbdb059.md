They sat there quietly after I’d instructed them to sit. All of them seemed a bit more at ease now. Not much, but certainly more so than when I had first entered the room, and each and every one of them stood at attention, ramrod straight, and snapped crisp salutes. I am their superior officer, and that show of respect was in order. However, now that I had their respect, I needed to earn their trust.

This was my squadron. A unit of pilots that were, yes, colored, but also would be the very best. We were not the first with the famous Red Tails, but I was determined we would not be the last. It was my job to ensure their success.

I was not concerned in the least with the color of their skin; unlike much of the world at that time. All I cared about was their ability. Nor did I care where they’d come from. Only what they could do. I had hand picked each one of these men for their accomplishments. Each, and every one of them had excelled in their classes. Each had the reflexes of a cat, and each had, in one way or another, displayed leadership qualities. These were the things I looked for in them. The only things I saw when looking out at them now.

And so, there they sit. Quietly watching me. Patiently waiting to hear what it is I have to say to them. As I look into each of their young faces I swell with pride. This is my squadron. So, to them I say: “Gentlemen, let’s begin.”
