**“Finding Inspiration”  by Phillip L. Rath**

Are you looking for inspiration in your prison environment? Is it a challenge? About to give up?

Here’s a little information to help you find a constant source of inspiration. It’s ALL AROUND YOU! You just need to recognize it.

Take your eyes off the dope man and his customers. Stop focusing on the abrasive C.O. and the apathetic administration. Quit banging your head against the iron bars, kicking the locked doors and staring at the seemingly miles of fencing.

Look up and see the tiny bird flapping his fragile wings against the domineering broad wings. Look down and see that tiny bug on spindly legs continue ever forward on an unknown quest, dodging pebbles twice his size, over ground so rough for his size that it would be like the hills of San Francisco to us, yet he never falters.

Notice the tiny flower hidden under the glade of grass, struggling for enough light to stay alive long enough to procreate.

Learn how to see inspiring things with new eyes and you’ll find you are surrounded by truly inspiring people, things and occasions.

You may even discover you’ve become an inspiration yourself.
