**"Good Samaritan" by Darnell Page**

“This is Mahmud Rehman Mohammed of Israel News Channel Sixty-Eight, reporting to you live from Ramallah where a recent suicide bomber attacked a U.S. military checkpoint, which is believed to be linked to yet another strategic strike by members of al-Qaeda. Sources say that as soon as the dust settled militant youths swarmed the bodies of the Americans and removed all their weapons and clothing, before disappearing into the surrounding neighborhoods.”

“Although seven of the ten soldiers posted here have sustained fatal injuries, those that are still alive can be seen crawling around in what appears to be their desperate search for aid or comrades; however, none of the residents milling about are in a hurry to help them, out of fear of repercussions from the taliban.”

“This is the sixth attack on both U.S. civilians and military personnel of this kind in recent days, due to the ever increasing American presence here in Ramallah. Both sides of this ongoing war have carried out attacks with deadly results. While al-Qaeda relies on suicide bombings and IEDs, the AMericans have launched several airstrikes at known and suspected Taliban strongholds and training camps. How long… Wait! What’s this? An unknown Israeli woman has just moved away from the crowds and is cradling the sole survivor in her arms to comfort him until more American forces can arrive.”

“Wow! This is the very first time a woman of Israeli nationality has broken Arabic law by coming into contact with a man who is not her husband while in public. Even though she is risking having her hands cut off or possible death, you can see the compassion this Good Samaritan has for the dead and dying. Witnessing moments such as these give proof that we as people need to rethink our ways of life. Nevertheless, I can tell you that one her identity is learned she will be made to suffer for her acts of loving-kindness towards what others view as an enemy of Allah.

“I’ll keep you up-to-date as more details emerge on this late breaking story. Reporting live from Ramallah, I’m Mahmud Rehman Mohammed signing off. Back to you Fazlur.”
