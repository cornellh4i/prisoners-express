**Bargains by E. Jones**

****Sometimes I wonder if I were wealthy, would I use coupons? I think saving money is a plus and getting a discount price is a plus. Having an average salary can make you appreciate a price break.

Now on the other hand, when you become wealthy, you do not want to be a cheapskate. But when I am wealthy and someone gives me a penny, I will still put it in the bank.
