Queen Mother by Vaughn Wright

I received a very informative letter from my aunt yesterday. (I am currently with a bygone generation once referred to as “away at college” and am halfway across the state, so my aunt and I correspond frequently.) Apparently, at 92 years of age, my grandmother, my Nana, has finally achieved “Mom” status, effectively making her an inner-city Queen Mother of the Block; ‘hood royalty, if you will. I am very proud.

The same single-lane street in Philadelphia’s west side where she lives now serves as her realm, but she and my grandfather, who was a preacher and passed away some time ago, came here from elsewhere. They traveled North as part of the Great Migration of blacks from down South way back in the day. A good part of the reason for my grandmother’s elevation is based on the fact that she came up on those days when fleeing the south and its separate-but-equal lie wasn’t just a search for greener pastures. Colored folks were dying down there, y’all, on the end of lynch mob’s ropes. You’ve seen the pictures.

Speaking of pictures, she has an old black and white photograph-- along with a lot of other black and white photographs-- she keeps in a cookie tin. It shows her street when there were only half a dozen or so cars parked on it because only that many people on the street could afford cars. I loved hearing her tell the stories behind those pictures. Yet even more fascinating for me are the things that have transpired of a historical significance that she recalls.

She still remembers when radio was the big thing in home entertainment; how good it felt to be on the winning side of two world wars; the Depression; iceboxes you had to buy ice for; race riots; Kennedy’s, Malcom’s and King’s assassinations; men walking on the moon; when I used to play in the toilet; the Blackout; the movie bombing; several “Trials of the Century” (She says that OJ killing them white people and getting away with it was the most entertaining one); and the great grandson I presented to her in ‘92. He shares the same birthday as my mother, her daughter. Since my mom had already passed, my Nana liked that.

Yes, Mom, she’s seen a lot in her lifetime. But you know what I think is the most amazing thing she’s ever witnessed? Life as it unfolded before her very porch steps over the last several decades. She’s watched generations of people come and go, live and die, laugh and cry. So if you were raised on her street, she knows everything about you and your family and can run your genealogy down better than a Maury Povich paternity test. Because mothers may lie, but not Mom’s eyes. Fortunately for some, she’s not one to gossip.

And never for a minute believe Mom can be fooled, for she has the ability to sum people or dress them down in the blink of an eye with equal exactitude. This is because she is a saint of the Lord’s and shares His Spirit; she knows what It knows. Put that in the bank, it will earn you interest.

Another truth that will benefit you about my grandmother: Do not rob, steal from, or cheat Mom. Karma is particularly vicious on this point, as are her neighbors.

Also now, her birthday, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, and Christmas have become Mom Appreciation Days, for which she shall be gifted accordingly.

Hers will be the first sidewalk shoveled after it snows.

The daily paper will be provided to her regularly by the first of her neighbors making a trip to the cornerstore. Sunday papers will be on the drunk across the street who used to have my grandfather pray for him all the time.

The fisherman will now courteously stop at her stoop when he drives through, so that from her porch throne, Mom need only voice her choices to receive his finest offerings. A half dozen clams will be thrown in, gratis.

She gave her car away years ago to my uncle. But if she still had it, it would be washed periodically and the block’s best mechanic would keep it maintained in perfect working order.

Certainly many of these perquisites are bestowed upon every neighborhood’s elderly, but Mom….ah, now Mom, she gets it all. The royal treatment. How long it will all last, I can’t say. That is the Lord’s domain. However, her reign shall endure until He calls her home. Long live the queen!
