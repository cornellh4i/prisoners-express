**"Simple Pleasures" by Calvin Carter**

Simple Pleasures" -- that's a mouthful... how many people outside of jail even know what a simple pleasure is? 'Cause once the handcuffs lock, you can't flip channels on the remote... watching a TV program from the actual beginning... or even being able to choose your own menu... Dudes have been known to fight their own cellmates to the death over issues of privacy in the cell... Many a thing that none of us even think about in the world being overbearingly large... cookies, chips, sodas, candy... It's not everyday that I can even use the restroom without at least my cellie's presence...

Here everything is structured 24-7 inside and out, so you might not be able to enjoy a hot and then cold shower after a game of ball... your simple pleasures change from a late night creep up to the "House of Pies" to dunking "Best Maid Cookies" in some low grade hot chocolate... hearing your name at mail call, don't matter who its from... really and truly, once those handcuffs lock around your wrist there are no more simple pleasures as we'll tend to try to find the pleasure in every act and action... private to public... even to the extreme of a lost fight... I don't believe I would have sat still long enough in the world to enjoy a game of scrabble or learn to play Triangle Dominoes... laying back with a good book as the radio plays some mellow songs is my simple pleasure.
