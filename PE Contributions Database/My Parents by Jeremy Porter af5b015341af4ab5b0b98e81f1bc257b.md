**My Parents By Jeremy Porter**

My peace of mine, my rock of serenity, my majestic blessing from the most high, are just a few statements of endearment that resonate within my heart & mind to express my deepest sentiments for the queen who birthed me into this world.	I have been broken down to my lowest point in life, lost everything only to find out who will love me despite any adversity I may face. My mother is my angel from god. Her strength has carried me when I was weak & felt like giving up. Her faith has inspired me to believe in positive outcomes when I felt like there was no hope left. Even when I tried pushing her away out of anger, stress & depression she remained steadfast in my corner….

As a man now who reflects back upon his childhood, I can clearly see the sacrifices made by my sweet dear mother, to give me opportunities and chances she herself never had. For that I am forever grateful. I would like for her to know that ultimately it is her unconditional love that makes the storms of my life seem so small in comparison & brings joy to my soul….
