Believe it or not, I survived a heart attack

Joseph Alvin Parrish

On February 10, 2019, I had to be rushed to the hospital due to a heart attack that I sustained. And now I am being admonished by everyone showing fake concern saying that I need to take better care of myself. Don’t get me wrong now, I accept the positive criticism but don’t try and pretend that you care when I know that you’re only throwing ammunition at the fire, gloating over my illness. There may be some who truly care and for that I tip my hat. When this incident occurred I had already been ill for quite some time. Whatever it is that’s ailing me it all seems so mysterious to me. Believe it or not? What did I do to deserve this cruel and unusual punishment? Why me, why me?

I was only trying to live my life the best way that I know how and to stay in good health. I confess that due to the fact that I made some bad decisions in my life of which I am ow experiencing the consequences of my decisions. Believe it or not, before being rushed to the hospital I was constantly having difficulty walking because unknowingly my body had way too much fluid. At first, I was curious as to what was wrong with me and trying to figure out how long was I going to have to go through this? I had a fervent desire to get through this. When I would over exert myself I would always experience shortness of breath, and an aching chest cavity, and so every time that this happened I find that I have no choice but to stop what I’m doing until my breathing returns to normal. Believe it or not, I survived a heart attack. I guess that on my part I am somewhat responsible for the outcome of my irresponsible behavior. Most likely, this would have never happened if I were taking care of my body, and eating proper foods. Also including getting adequate exercise. Believe it or not, I just gave up on everything besides chasing dope and committing crime. I lost all passion for expressing myself. All I could think about was how much dope do I have left and what my next escapade was going to be. What was I going to do to get some more dope because I cannot function if I am not high. When I am sober I do not feel as if I am going to be able to cope. Life feels so empty and meaningless without some type of drug induced feelings.

I lost interest in all aspects of life except ingestion of alcohol and drugs, damaging my body and leaving me open for all kinds of sicknesses and diseases. Come on man believe it or not, I suffered a heart attack; real talk.
