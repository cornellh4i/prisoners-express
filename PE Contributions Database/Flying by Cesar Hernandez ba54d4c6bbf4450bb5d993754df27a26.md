**Flying by Cesar Hernandez**

Flying is such a hassle, especially when the plane runs out of fuel. My neighbor Roxi has a three hour flight leaving at 11 AM. She arrives at 2 AM.

My phone rings at 2 AM. Roxi once again loses her car key. Roxi misplaces everything. She buys a new phone about every month. She loses her car keys about six times per year. The BMW dealership knows her very well. As soon as they see her red hair, they know she needs new keys.

I get her key out of my safe and walked down the hall. Roxi says her spare keys are in her closet safe. Roxi wants me to promise not to dig in her safe. I promise not to dig in her safe. I say I have no time for games and hang up. She calls back and insists that I promise not to dig in her safe. I say goodbye.

Now I am curious. What does she have in her two cubic foot safe? Roxi knows I’m not going to dig in her stuff. That’s why she gives me a key to her place. On the other hand, I don’t give Roxi a key to my place. My wife won’t even let me give the key to my best friend. I’ve known her since elementary school.

Roxi is desperate and calls back. She tries to blackmail me not to dig in her safe. I say she needs to give me the code or I’m going back to sleep. She has a terrible code that I can easily guess in three tries. I see 5 BMW keys. Roxi says they should all work. I grab two. I ask Roxi to remind me why I am going to the airport at 2 AM. She says because she’s awesome.

I call a valet to bring my E-Class up. I grab a red bull from Roxi’s fridge. I give the valet a twenty and the Red bull. I tell them Roxi is at the airport and we’ll arrive shortly.

The airport is fifteen miles away. Traffic is non-existent so it takes no time to get there. I use my car phone to call Roxi. She tells me the garage and floor.

Roxi gives me a huge hug and I give her the two keys. I ask her why she still flies United and when was the last time her flight was on time. She says her company always flies United and her last time being on time was ten flights ago. Today the plane runs out of fuel and they have to stop at another airport. They sit on the tarmac for a couple of hours before taking off once more.

She asks me for my car phone number. I tell Roxi not even my parents have my car number. She gives me her car number and says to call her.

Roxi wants to race home. I remind her this area is a speed trap. She says I’m worried my E-class can’t beat her 5 series. I tell her my car is two years newer than hers and it can beat her. I also tell her I could’ve saved money by staying asleep. I give the valet a twenty. I am in the airport only thirty minutes and get charged 9 dollars for parking. This call is costing me by the minute. Now I’m going to waste gas racing home.

She says she’s taking me and my wife to dinner. She’ll get us into Trece, Nobu, or Nick & Sams tonight. I tell her I’ll call Sam. She says she’ll call Nick.

We run the red light to get to the highway. We are flying down the highway at 100 miles/hour.
