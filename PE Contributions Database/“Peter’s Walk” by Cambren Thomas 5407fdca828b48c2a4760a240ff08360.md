**“Peter’s Walk” by Cambren Thomas**

The afternoon sun painted the patchy clouds and surrounding mountains a light peachy hue. Pete sat at the edge of his pier, watching the water drip off of his big toe into the lake. The hypnotizing span of ripples in the water’s surface did nothing to comfort his sense of defeat. He had tried five times now, and achieved no success. *I’m going crazy,* he thought, and he laughed to himself as he heard the lively jingle of a familiar collar closing in on him.

Pete’s black lab retriever pop, Pedro, scuttled up and slid on his paws into Pete’s side -- an over-chewed toy in his mouth, excitement in his wag. Pete rubbed Pedro’s head as the puppy nestled closer to him and Pete looked down at the thorough drench of his shirt and jeans; then at the well-worn leather book sitting dry and quiet on the other side of him. Maybe he had missed something, some minute detail that would manifest the miracle. He thumbed to the place he had bookmarked -- *Matthew 14*. He mouthed the verses to himself, closed his eyes for some prayer-filled assurance, and looked down at Pedro.

“Alright, I’m going for another walk of faith. Pray for me little buddy.”

Pedro *bowed his head* alright...and continued to wrestle more bits of peanut butter from his toy.

Pete stood to his feet, swelled his chest with a deep gulp of air, and strode forward -- instantly sinking into the depths below. Pete emerged through the glassy surface of the lake, trounced but still willing to keep trying. Pedro looked down at Pete, shaking his furry head -- either in mirth, or because he was dogged in devouring every hidden morsel within his toy. Pete climbed back up onto the pier, and was greeted by a few peanut buttery licks to his forehead from his pup. Pete was still resolute. He stood straight up again, and stepped forward...splashing roughly into the smooth waves once more.

Pete kept at it until the entire span of copious clouds overhead had departed with the winds, and the sun had begun to set the valley ablaze in auburn. Pete was floating on his back in his skivvies, along with the tide; his sopping clothing in a pile on the pier, his bible polka-dotted with water droplets of various widths -- Pedro still observing and resting his haunches, toy still between his teeth. Pete’s mind drifted from biblical miracles to mouth-watering thoughts of dinner. He slowly turned his body in the flowing current, swam a short clip, and hoisted himself back onto the pier with the last bit of his ever-tapering energy.

Pedro tilted his head, still gnawing on his gnarled up plaything, and gave Pete an inquisitive stare. Pete curiously eyeballed him back.

“What? My name’s *Peter*, but I’m no apostle, disciple or saint -- and even *that* Peter only made it a few steps. This whole experiment was just wishful thinking. I’m done for the day bud.”

Pete began to walk away, but Pedro finally dropped his toy from his mouth, and began to whimper for Pete’s undivided attention. He trained his stare from Pete, to the lake, and back to Pete again. Pete squatted down and kneaded behind Pedro’s ears with both hands.

“I am not going for another dunk in the lake buddy. No way.”

Pedro whined again and freed himself out of Pete’s kind clutch to go prod at the water-speckled pages of the open bible with his nose. He even gave it a little paw push in Pete’s direction.

“No Pedro. I’m done. Finito. No more reading, no more splashy.”

Pete groaned tiredly as he scooped the bible away; and grabbed up the chew toy and two armfuls of his soaked clothes.

“I appreciate your enthusiasm bud, but I am tired and hungry...I bet you are too?”

Pete turned to head back to his quaint cabin home, but Pedro barked defiantly behind him. Pete turned to his determined pup -- who was no standing firm against the pier’s edge.

“Okay, you wanna take a dip? Be my guest…”

Pete gave the rounded toy a good pitch into the lake, and watched it bobble a beckon to Pedro. Pete then turned and began his journey back indoors, hearing Pedro’s collar tinkling off in the direction of the water. Pete was nearing his lawn when Pedro finally came panting and jingling up beside him; his toy triumphantly in his mouth, his tail wagging joyfully, and his swarthy fur coat -- DRY.
