**“Arguments” by Victoria Page**

One day after spending time with a childhood friend my husband got upset with me. I had just got back home from taking her home. I tried to explain to him that there had been an accident on the road. He then began to yell at me as I was explaining. He then turned it all around and he began to accuse me of having been with another man. I was shocked that he accused me of having cheated. I got angry in return, and the argument then began. As the argument heated up and we got in each other’s faces, he started to clench his fists. After five minutes of clenching, he did something I never expected. My husband took a swing at me for the first time. As his fist connected with my stomach, I doubled over. As I sat on the ground in shock, I had no idea what to do. My husband then realized that he had hit me. Once the realization processed in his mind, he dropped to his knees and begged for forgiveness. At the time I was shell shocked and forgave him. I never realized this was to be my punishment for our future arguments as well.
