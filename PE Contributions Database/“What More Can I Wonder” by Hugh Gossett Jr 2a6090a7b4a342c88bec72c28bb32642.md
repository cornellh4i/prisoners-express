**“What More Can I Wonder” by Hugh Gossett Jr.**

I sit here contemplating man’s achievements at decimating the beauty of nature to complete extinction. All that is left is the sky and a few meager clouds and a few trees planted where man wanted them planted. What more can I wonder?

I sit here contemplating man’s achievement at attaining ever more the greatest of heights with concrete, glass and steel. Are we attempting the Tower of Babel or a stairway to heaven? What more can I wonder?

I sit here contemplating man’s life as a child enduring years of schools and college in order to gain the knowledge that gives him, as a man, the power over another human being, to enslave them to a life of mediocrity. What more can I wonder?

I sit here at this window contemplating my life as I look out at man’s achievements. Who has died to build this city with its tall buildings, streets of asphalt, and concrete sidewalks teeming all with the mad rush of people trying to satisfy the whims of the rich and powerful? What can I do to make my humble mark in such a place? What more can I wonder?

I sit here and wish I could change it all back to what it once was, all except for my seat at this window, looking out contemplating what I can achieve. What more can I wonder?

Do you sometimes wonder?
