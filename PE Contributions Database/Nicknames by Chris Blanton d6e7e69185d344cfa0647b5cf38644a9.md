One of the most peculiar things I did when I was a young boy was give people nicknames. I know that doesn’t sound all that peculiar. What made it so was the wacky nicknames my adolescent mind came up with.

I’ve decided on some of my strangest to share here, with you.

For some reason I called my friend Chris Bufferin. Yep, as in the little white pill you took for a headache. I don’t even know why I chose to call him that.

My friend Eric was “Strawberry”, Ronnie was “Scrawny Molecule”, and get this one - Stephen I called “Pinocchio-nosed beaver with the slow poke motion added to it”. Yes, that whole long name!

I had some kind of normal ones too. My friend Matthew (Chris’s brother) I called “Bear Cub” and my buddy Aaron was “Staring Eyes”.

As I’ve said, I don’t know how in the world I came up with these nicknames, but they will forever be part of my childhood memories.
