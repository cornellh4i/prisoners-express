**“Eyes Playing Tricks or Awesome Job?” by Giles Belcher**

“Are my eyes playing tricks on me or is this really happening? A red fox pushing a white goose in a white 4-wheeled wicker cart!”

Am I seeing a fairy tale or is this a trick prank setup? I’m not sure about this, but anything and everything can happen if people decide to do something.

I’m betting on trained animals that are performing a staged event! To make this happen, I would guess months of training the animals, which are not friends for one thing and the other is they are predators and prey in the wild. This is unique in respect to the animals actual demeanor towards each other. Is the goose watching the fox to see if it will attack, or be still pushing the cart along? I’ll let this slide for now.

The craftsmanship of the wicker cart is amazing! Chrome bars for frame and handles. White plastic or steel wheels with chrome center caps. To make the wicker basket body must take months of work to weave, bending, and forming a basic outline to start with patience and time to do this correctly. The other is a neat white paint job done to the wicker body itself. Many coats must be applied and sealer applied I believe. An audacious undertaking and well planned job done! In awe most definitely. That’s all I can say. Could I do this? Don’t know til attempted! How about you?
