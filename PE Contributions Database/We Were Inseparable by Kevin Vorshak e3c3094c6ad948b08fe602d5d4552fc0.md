**"We Were Inseparable" by Kevin Vorshak**

The question blindsided Martin. Alise stared openly at him: her blue, eleven-year old eyes holding an innocence that belied the perceptiveness of the question. He looked down at his clasped hands. The ticking of the mantle clock filled the silence.

“I’m sorry, Reverend Martin,” Ruth Patton said. “Alise didn’t mean to upset you.”

“No, it’s ok. I’m the one who should apologize. The question… I did not expect… wasn’t prepared for it.” He looked toward Alise who now looked uncomfortable.

“She thought she saw you praying at the culvert near the gas station the other day,” Ruth said.

“You looked so sad,” Alise added. She slid closer to her mom on the couch.

Martin leaned back into the chair allowing his arms to drape loosely over the sides. He liked the coziness of the Patton’s living room. He stopped by after hearing that Dale Patton had been laid off and wanted to see if he could offer any comfort or assistance. “I was sad, Alise. We were inseparable at one time.” At their confused look, Martin continued, “Sorry, I know that comment needs explaining. Ruth, may I trouble you for something to drink first?”

“I have coffee or I can heat water for tea. Or there’s ice water.”

“Thank you. Coffee’s fine. No sugar. Do you have creamer?”	“Will milk do?”

“Milk’s fine, Ruth. Thank you.” Martin gathered his thoughts as she prepared and served him. She brought a fairly large mug for which he was grateful. He took a generous sip. “Very good.”

Ruth returned to the couch with Alise.

Martin placed the cup on a coaster on a nearby end table. “When you saw me, Alise, it was an anniversary of sorts. One I’ve commemorated for over forty years now, since I was a little older than you.” He pointed toward her.

She smiled prettily.

“I grew up in this town,” Martin continued, “and I had two best friends: John and Danny.”

“Like me and Sally and Denise.”	“Alise, don’t interrupt,” Ruth said.

Martin smiled, “It’s OK, Ruth. Yes, Alise, I suppose it was just like that.”

They waited patiently as Martin took another sip of coffee. Keeping the mug cupped in his hand, Martin said, “People even joked that John and Danny both flunked second grade so we could all graduate together.”

“Is that true?” Alise asked.

“Well, it happened, but I don’t believe they did it purposefully. My mom said they did because I was too ordinary to move up a grade.”

“Really!” Ruth said.

“Oh, mom never meant anything by it. Besides,” he chuckled, “it was true.”

“So where are John and Danny now?” asked Alise.

“Heaven.” Martin felt the tightening in his chest. HOw much should he share? He took another sip of the now tepid coffee and placed it back on the coaster. “The summer before our eighth grade year, we were going to play ball at the park, but I had to mow the yard first. They decided to meet me…” The words choked in Martin’s throat.

“It’s OK, Reverend,” Ruth said. “You don’t need to go on.”

Martin wiped at his eyes and took a deep breath. “Maybe… Maybe I do. It downpoured the night before and flooded the culvert. John jumped in not realizing the strength of the current. It sucked him down. Danny tried to save him.”

“My Lord,” Ruth said, pulling Alise closer. “I heard about that. That’s the reason for the fence and the signs.”

“We were inseparable,” Martin said almost to himself. “I should’ve been with them. Before that summer ended, I tried to join them.”

“Reverend…”

Martin held up his hand. “It’s OK. Obviously I didn’t succeed, though I came close.” He clasped his hands together and looked intensely at Ruth and Alise. “Before I came out of the coma, God spoke to me. He told me not to worry about John and Danny -- that they were OK. He told me He wanted me to remain to save other lives.”

“So you became a minister,” Alise said.

“Yes. I became a minister.”
