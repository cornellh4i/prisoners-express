**The Peasant, The Yak, and I by Rolf Rathmann**

Her voice was soft, serene, though surprisingly void of any mystery. Just very present, in the “now”.

“As you go further into slumber, though not sleep, mind you, for you are more aware than you have ever been. I’m going to count backwards from ten. And together, incomplete safety, will begin this journey. Ten. You look down. It’s completely cloudy, you step into the cloud, onto a pavement step. Nine. Another step downward. You see it more clearly. Take that next step.”

And so I did.

“The clouds are thinning. Eight. Another step. Seven. Six. Continue going down the flight of stairs. Five. You can now see the stairs ahead of you. Four. You’re relaxed. Breathing normally. Three. Two. One. All clouds and haze are gone. First, you look down. What do you see?”

Without hesitation, in a lower register of voice, I respond “Rocks, pebbles, blackish-brown dirt, and worn, craggy, deeply lined feet. My feet. My second left toe has a gold ring. Tarnished. My toes are painted, though chipped and faded.”

My hypnotherapist, Jen Kreitzer, had been referred to me by a friend, who had suggested past life regression therapy as a means of explaining the same dream consuming the last few months of my sleep. Gently, Jen coaxed me: “Slowly, you raise your head to take in your surroundings. Describe what you see first.”

My breathing became more labored. Chill of the early morning air tingled my spine.

A yak! I exclaimed. It was the same animal from my dreams, always with that mournful stare.

“Remember, nothing can hurt you here.”

“It’s damp, thick, matted coat reeks like old stale wool. Like that of a wet dog fresh from a romp in the rain. I have stared this animal down for years. It’s what we do when I prepare it for market. Her gracefully curved, long horns, her sign of maturity; dark long drooping eyes, that when you look at her, almost has a knowing, relatable stare. I sort of expect it to wink back.”

“I’m sad, for this is no ordinary trip to the market.”

“Why is that? What time frame do you live in? Where are you?”

“Time doesn’t have much meaning for us here, but I am clearly high up in the mountains of Asia. A remote village. My papa is in the distance urging me to hurry. He sounds tired, resigned, with a slight edge to his voice.”

“We’re going to leave this day for a moment. No, no. Relax, you’ll return shortly, but I want you to go back in time, to the last conversation you had with your papa.”

I squirmed in my seat. My muscles tensed.

“No one wants me Sangha! You are too old to marry off and that useless, good for nothing yak, too old to even produce milk, was to have been part of your dowry, but now-”

“I know papa”

“What do you know, child? You must go and sell this animal. Perhaps the few trinkets we can make will bring us better luck.” And with that, he stormed off.

“My feet are sore” I said, having returned to the mountainside. “The yak and I are plodding gingerly along. I’m yanking on the rope to lead the way. It urinates as we walk, mixing in with the mud from the deluge of rain. Long ago we passed the market, and the village temple, and finally, the edge of town. We had been trekking for several days.”

“It’s dark, early, and brisk. I’m scared, for I know I shall never see papa again. I. Oh so many-”

Again, that lilting sweet voice, “No need for tears. You’re safe now. I shall count backwards, and when you hear the chime, you will be back in the office, refreshed, relaxed, at complete peace. Ten. Nine...”

And so she counted down, slowly bringing me out of an existence long ago, one I would later deduce around the early 1800s. Then the echo of her chime. I slowly opened my eyes.

“Wow” I simply uttered, after a pregnant pause.

Finally, Jen said, “That was a big step, alphonse. No? That took great courage for you to leave everything. I think it connects with the courage you’re displayed in this lifetime, what with immigrating to this country, and all. That took guts, and -”

“Or, it connects to how I always start something, never finish. There is no resolution,” I whisper, more to myself than to Jen.

“Perhaps in our next session. In time, you’ll get there” She concluded.
