**The Girl and the Dandelion by Vicki Hicks**

In life we never take time to “smell the roses.” My daughter was the cutest little blonde haired, blue eyed sweetheart who never passed a flower without trying to pick it. It took many times of telling her to leave them there and let other little girls smell the flowers. She was so convinced that you could only smell the flower if you picked it up first. To her, there was no such thing as a weed; it was just a flower that needed to be picked up. My little princess still loves flowers and takes every opportunity to stop and smell the flowers whenever she passes them.

This is a lesson for all of us. Slow down and always take time to smell the flowers.
