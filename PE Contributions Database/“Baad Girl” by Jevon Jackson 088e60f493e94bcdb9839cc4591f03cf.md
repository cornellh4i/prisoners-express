**“Baad Girl” by Jevon Jackson**

Their mission was simple. Or so it seemed. The Wizard, the Priest and the Warlock had three sunsets to get the RedGold Box safely to the Royal Chapel of Evergreen. The elegant box was six inches on all sides, embossed with gold leafed intricate lattice carvings and inlaid with a rich blood red velvet. The chamberlain gave them only three instructions that they must follow without pause: 1. ) Never open the box; 2. ) Don’t drop the box; and 3. ) Don’t run with the box in tow.

As the three of them embarked on their journey, the Wizard, the Priest and the Warlock rode on horseback throughout the plains and valleys of the wide, distant land without incident. On the third day, as they approached the Naked Forest, their horses suddenly began bucking, neighing and collectively refusing to move any further. The Priest’s horse bucked him clean off, tossing him face-first into the gravel and dirt as the horse galloped zig-zag and confused between the barren birchwood trees. As the Wizard and the Warlock safely dismounted, straining the hold the reigns of their horses, trying to subdue them, a little four-foot blond haired girl appeared before them all.

“Your stallions are frightened ill,” she said. “I shall calm them with a melody.” The soft-voiced little girl produced a flute from her waistband and began playing a slow, serene tune.

The Warlock was amazed at how this little sprite of a being could play something so beautiful and hypnotizing. He witnessed the immediate calming effect her flute-song had on the horses. The Priest’s horse moved slowly towards the little girl and hypnotically stared down at her feet. It was then that the Warlock noticed that the charismatic little girl didn’t have human legs or feet at all, but the scraggly, animalistic legs and hooves of an ornery old goat. The Warlock felt a tiny thump against his forehead. He turned to see the Wizard throwing a second pebble at him, which missed. The Wizard and the Priest were both plugging their ears with their fingers and emphatically mouthing urgent words that he could not hear. The sweet flute-music was so loud now it seemed to fill the entire forest. As the Warlock covered his ears, the Priest’s horse slumped onto the ground and its body morphed into a little sapling that quickly grew tall Into a leafless birchwood tree that reached high beyond where the eye could see.

The Wizard reached into his large shoulder bag and pulled out what looked like a piece of chalk. He puffed on it like a cigarette and huffed out two huge billowing rings of smoke. The enlarging hazy rings enveloped around the little girl and encased her in a bubble, muffling the flute sound. The translucent, milky bubble lifted her into the sky and floated away.

“We must proceed forthwith,” the Priest announced, walking quickly through the trees. “The sun shall fall shortly.”

As the Warlock checked his satchel to ensure the safety of the RedGold, the towering trees next him began to move their branches like arms. The branches stretched out to grab at the Warlock’s legs and limbs. Startled, he dropped the RedGold Box and it landed like a thousand pounds of lead on a mossy path of dirt. The ground around the Warlock immediately shook and splintered open, swallowing the Warlock and the towering trees subduing him.

With his magic rope, the Wizard lassoed the RedGold Box as it titled on the edge of the rumbling open ground. He tugged on the rope and pulled the box into his hand. Before he could secure it in his shoulder bag he looked up to see the little girl with the goat legs falling quickly from the sky. She landed squarely, upright on her hooves, with a heavy thud that kicked up a plume of dust. As the little girl began calmly playing her flute-music again, what looked like a snarling two-headed muscular horse began galloping, with the force of a hundred horses, directly towards the Wizard. Without hesitation, the WIzard turned the opposite direction and ran for his life. In mid stride, the Wizard’s body separated into a swarm of buzzing black and red dragonflies that ascended high into the light blue sky.

The little girl picked up the Wizard’s bag from the ground and fished out the RedGold Box.

“So pretty,” she said, inspecting it and turning it over in her hand.

“No, no – please! Don’t!” the Priest yelled, a few feet away. As she opened the box, a bright blinding light emanated from inside. It was a light so powerful that it seemed to illuminate the entire world around her.

It was what appeared to be hours later, well after the Priest closed the RedGold Box, secured it safely in his hands and made his way to the Royal Chapel before sunset, when the little girl realized that she was now trapped inside the box with a billion other souls.
