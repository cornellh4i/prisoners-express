**“Avocados for Guacamole” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

When life gives you tomatoes, you make *pico de gallo*; when it gives you avocados, you make guacamole; but when it makes you short… Well, then you’re stuck being vertically challenged. Now that Ii’ve officially offended all those of small stature and committed a social faux pas. I’m certain this will be the last you hear from me. Our ever-vigilant, omniscient P.C police are, at this moment, gearing up for their latest “bag and tag ‘em” mission; straight to my humble abode. In the meantime, allow me to elaborate.

I’m a fan of irony, wit and sarcasm. There is an essential truth to these similar to that found in every old, tired, overused cliche. When life, Lady Fortune, her sisters the Three Fates, or however you explain those inexplicable independent forces that seemingly bully us throughout our lives. When those, these, this, or that gives us something difficult or cumbersome, we should try to make the best of a bad situation. Certain experiences are universal - loss (i.e. death of a loved one or close relative or friend, one’s freedom of expression and liberty, sense of self), sadness, life’s challenges, etc. - felt by any and every person regardless of language, cultural, generational, ethnic, economic barriers. The woman vacationing in the Hamptons or the man driving through Cuba can feel grief the same as the runaway teenager in San Jose, CA or an incarcerated felon.

While, most often, we encourage one another to make the best of any situation (God bless you perennial optimists). Most of us behave to the contrary. In person, we can see the most egregious examples of people making the worst of an already bad situation. Prisoners are generally condemned to accept whatever they are given. Many a justification is found in it being their due, just desserts. Such is the problem with our sense of justice today - as if two cruelties correct any wrong? If i happen to survive (doubtful) the P.C. police’s “sensitivity counselling,” we can discuss justice.

Anyways, being in prison is a bad situation by definition. Not only bad for the poor incarcerated soul, but for all those intimately connected with them. We all know the stories about “prison.” The rapes, exploitation, violence, manipulation, oppression, desperation. Yet, we see nothing of the best of the worst of situations we can encounter (by far, being a P.O.W. is the worst of the worst in modern times or a kidnapee of P.C. police). Oh crap! P.C. Police is already at my door. Good thing that they will wait until I answer the door. Let’s hear it for polite manner! As I was saying, we, the society, value resilience among other things. Many prisons are overcrowded with those destitute of spirit, but there we also find compulsion, if not compassion, and care for a world that has abandoned them to their just desserts. Prisoners constantly astonish the society. They - the living dead - show more life, love desire and connection to those that left them to rot in some concerte box than many of us do with our families and closest friends while all at liberty.

You might find it sad, shocking, unbelievable, or hopeless romanticism. For my part, I find it terrific, stupendous and - yes, god dammit - inspiring. If, supposedly, the scourge of society can still manifest some of the best virtues prized by the rest of us. Then, maybe, just maybe, there’s some hope for the rest of us. I mean, really, if a guy who knows he’s going to die old and decrepit in a 9-by-13 cell, forgotten by all those he’s loved can still smile, find something to laugh about, give advice and still hunger for meaningful relationships, day in and day out after failed attempt upon failure. Well, then who the hell am I to bitch about a little sensitivity counselling?

When life gives you lemons… yeah, you already know, but I’ll take mine with a side of rum if you don’t mind. I - for Hell’s sake! Stop banging, I’m coming already.
