**"Breakfast" by Anthony Montecino**

It has long been said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I for one believe that. Allow me to share my breakfast with you. I have cheese grits, eggs, sausage, hash browns, and toast with jelly or jam. Now, sometimes my eggs are scrambled, fried, or boiled. Sometimes I have sausage patties, links, and sometimes bacon. Sometimes I have grape jelly or apple, and sometimes strawberry jam on my buttered toast. I always have a mixture of cranberry, grape, and apple juice.

One morning while sitting at the table for our breakfast, my young daughter of nine asked me a question. She said "Papa, why do you eat the same thing every morning? Wouldn’t you like to have some pancakes or cereal with milk, or some fruit?"

Looking at me with those beautiful big blue eyes, I could see that she was very serious and extremely curious as to my answer. So I replied, "why, *mi cielo,* I do have pancakes, cereal, milk and fruit; you see *mi vida*, the grits are a type of grain and is therefore cereal, the toast is bread/flour which is pancakes, the cheese is made from milk, and my juice is a blend of fruits! So I eat a different breakfast every morning depending on what I want everything to be!"

I could tell by the look on her face that she was somewhat confused and trying to think it through. Finally, a big smile spread across her face as she turned to look at her mother, then back at me, as she said "So, if I want my bowl of cereal and milk to be ice cream and blueberries, then can I?"

"Well, of course you can make believe it to be anything you like" I replied.

To which she responded "Well, sometimes Momma gives me a glass of milk and a bowl of frozen fruit for breakfast, why can't I have ice-cream with blueberries which is actually the same thing since ice cream is made from milk and blueberries are fruit! And that way you guys can make believe that I am having a glass of milk and a bowl of fruit, so I don’t have to!"

Breakfast means many different things to many different people. To me, it is a time for bonding, a time to be close to my wife and daughter. It is a time to discuss our goals for the day and talk about our dreams we had the night before. I will always cherish memories of those times, and when I once again am able to sit at the table and have my breakfast with my family, that will be a joy to my heart. A time to create more memories.

So, until then, I will continue to make believe that I am at that table and eating my breakfast of whatever I want it to be, despite what it really is, with my wife and daughter.

And for the record, on those sometimes mornings, you can best believe that instead of a glass of milk and a bowl of frozen fruit, that little girl got ice-cream and blueberries.
