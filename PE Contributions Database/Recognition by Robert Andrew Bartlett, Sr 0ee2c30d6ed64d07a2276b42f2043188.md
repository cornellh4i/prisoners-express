***Recognition* by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.**

They say the average prisoner loses contact with his family and friends outside in about seven years. I was lucky. I guess. I was only gone twenty months. Then again, my parents passed away, my brother died of prostate cancer, and I heard that someone had closed out my Facebook account.

I was not allowed to attend any of the funerals.

Kirby never wrote to me. He was supposed to be my best friend, but he never visited me or even applied to be on my list. I wasn’t angry with him though. I hadn’t expected too much after I swatted him with a rolled up newspaper and told him to go away.

Besides, with most of my family gone, you might think I shouldn’t be fretting over one male companion. I am though. I thought we were BFF’s. You do know what the second ‘F’ stands for, don’t you?

I left the prison in a set of white clothes, carrying a small”gate fee” and a bus ticket.

The greyhound left me about six miles from the house. I stuck out my thumb.

No one stopped. No one slowed down.

Instead of the state highway, I hiked along a county road that went by the cemetery. I visited my parents’ grave. I didn’t know where my brother was.

As I approached the house, I saw Mrs. Brown sitting on her front porch knitting - or maybe crocheting. Whatever she did with those needles most evenings. Sandy was standing beside her, probably urging her to put her stuff away and retire inside with a hot cup of tea. A thin stream of white smoke was rising from the chimney. All the snow within three feet of the bricks was melted, exposing a growing patch of dry shingles. Sandy was as beautiful as ever. After twenty months in prison, all the girls looked good -even her mother- but none could compete with Sandy. She used to smile when she saw me. Or so I imagined. And I’d always gotten a boner when I saw her. But somehow the girl next door had remained far away.

Mrs. Brown got up and turned away toward her front door. Sandy looked at me for a few seconds. I couldn’t see her eyes well yet, but I knew they were blue and beautiful. She seemed to be starting into the aching emptiness of my soul. I know she recognized me but there was no longer any warmth or tenderness in her gaze. In fact, she seemed a bit nervous.

I know I was.

I had dreamed of this moment. She had bounded down the porch steps and across the lawn. Her mother wasn’t in the dream just the two of us. She had thrown herself into my arms and we’d fallen into a bank. I’d…

Sandy opened the door and helped her mother carry her carpet bag into the house.

Then I saw my friends in the background, standing near the edge of the woods. I know he recognized me, but he showed neither tongue not fang. He stared intently at me, head high ears erect, body tense. It was the first time I’d seen him with his tail down since he was a puppy.

I called him.

He turned away.

The house was dusty. I heard water in the pipes and air in the ducts. A rafter creaked. At first I heard an occasional drip outside my window, but by midnight the icicles hanging from the gutter had frozen again. THe house was too big for one prisoner. It was darker, lonelier, and creepier than my cell had been.

In the morning, I went to the back door as had been my custom and duty in happier times. A bowl was on the sundeck, nothing in it but a little melting ice. The show was almost gone but I could still see a few fading tracks. Something had come from the woods and crossed the back lawn, padded up the steps and one circuit around the deck. Then he’d gone back the way he came.
