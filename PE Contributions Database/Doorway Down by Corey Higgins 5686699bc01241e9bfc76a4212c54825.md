"**Doorway Down" by Corey Higgins**

****An island off to itself is called “Doorway down”. The reason given is because what looks like an outhouse only made out of stone white stone at that, two long and big trees on each side, with stone walls and steps all around it though they’re not tall walls you can tell it’s built to last longer than a human’s lifespan. A big black doorway can be seen and only a few have gone through it, but even crazier is that only one has returned from walking through the “Doorway down”.

On a trip planned to swim with some of the biggest shrimps in the sea, on the west part of the dead Sea Kevin speeds the boat and his crew toward what looks like a small island. Kevin thinks why not check it out the dangiest swim, it could be a new island undiscovered. He yells out to the crew on deck of his sixty footers twin-turbo speedboat “Prepare to come to landfall two thousand-yard and closing!” As they pulled up toward what now seemed like one of the smallest islands ever seen, a crewman named Tom asked Kevin “What the hell is it, boss?” There it stood on a sandy beach all by itself the “Doorway down”. Kevin takes a camer and shots a few tunes and they throw anchor down next to the sandy island.

As Kevin gets the crew prepared to come to shore he grabs his 9mm pistol and they head out toward the only thing on this island the “doorway”. Tom, as they walk closer to it only six hundred yards away now, says “It’s not on the map Kevin what and where did it come for?”

Kevin only grins at Tom, “Yea I know Tom but let’s check it out for we get all crazy. And we both government always hiding shit it could be some kind of base. Tom let out a sigh and said “Great we all going to jail or better fixing to get shot.” They both laughed.

As they came up toward the stone doorway two of the crew said they should go back and watch the boat, though Kevin a little pissed said to go back only leaving “Kevin, Tom, and one low rung rope boy Billy.”

Tom looks around and even touches the stone wall and takes the first step on the stone step. He looks back toward his captain and grins “Well no signs that says stay away or warnings?”

Kevin walks past Tom walking all the way to the stone door which has a black opening, and he grins and says “It’s dark as hell, I’ll be back Tom if I don’t back call my wife and tell her that I love her and her food sucks.” Tom only smiles a little and says real fast “Kevin I don’t like this let’s call it in first and then send someone else”. But without no other words being said Kevin walked through the doorway and Kevin could only see a few feet in front of himself but could make out the stairway leading downward. He reaches out toward the back pocket and pulls out a small flashlight and points it down the perfect white stone steps. He yells out to Tom, “It’s a stairway and it’s fucking long way down.” Right then a large flash of blue light comes at Kevin killing all sound and blasts out the door making Billy and Tom step back.

Tom yells out for Kevin but no answer comes and Billy runs up toward the doorway and cries “Captain are you OK?” Without thinking Billy runs in the doorway vanishing into the dark hole. Tom tried to say no but could not find his voice. Then it came once more a light so bright that it knocked Tom down to his knees, he lay there on the stone steps looking and crying out this doorway, yelling out their names each by first and last names.

Six weeks later state and government put up signs warning people to stay away. No one still has come to find out what is down there, but nine months later Kevin walks out of the Doorway, only he can’t turn or haiv almost like he’s dumbfounded. Still no Billy or the other sixteen crew of top trained government men has come back, and Kevin lays on a bed locked away showing no sign of anything. So in the middle of nowhere and out in the sea a doorway lays await, for what we have no clue but this I can tell you - this doorway is not for us humans.
