My Parents By Katie Virginia Hidalgo

I can still hear my father’s voice in the background as my mother called me an “infidel” and an “abomination” over the phone. I had called my parents to tell them the truth, to unload a 23 year old burden I had been carrying my entire life. Having been raised in a muslim family, I was well aware that what I had to tell them would result in me losing my family. Knowing it would not be wellreceved, I had already prepared myself as much as possible for the inevitable outcome - ostracism. A part of me rebelled against my decision, but that voice was drowned out by the scream of the bigger part of me that had resolved to finally be happy - to finally be free.

Growing up, I was in foster care often, yet I still spent a lot of time with my family. My father and I were close, yet distant. He was rather reserved around me, and held me at arm’s length, and it was recently that I realized why. I had always had a feminine nature, preferring skirts and heels to baggy jeans and sneakers, but never dared wear them in front of my family. One time however, my father caught me in my sister’s dress, a skinny thing, and beat me. He had often called me a “sissy” and told me to “man up” and “grow some balls.”

You see, I had always felt angry with myself for going along with my parents’ and society’s expectations. I **hated** growing a beard, and yet I dutifully obeyed my father’s order to in accordance with a habit. I put on a show of “masculinity” in a desperate attempt to hide my true nature - but it inevitably showed through. I felt so **fake**, as if I were a monkey dancing to society’s tune. I felt as if the mask I put on to hide my true nature had no air holes - I was suffocating. I **had** to come out, or I would take my own life. It was now or never.

Then one day a woman (transgender) in my unit spoke to me. I poured my heart out to her, and I owe her my life. She helped me transition. She helped me remove the mask, but the burden still remained, heavier than ever. I felt like Atlas, stooping under the weight of the world upon his shoulders. So I called. It turned out as I expected: they were **furious.** It has now been four years since I last heard from them, and each day is a struggle. My own parents cast me aside because I obeyed Ivietzsches Maxim to “Become who you are!”. But it was worth the sacrifice. Now I am Finally **ME.** “James” is only a name on paper, but “Katie” is a real person. I did it to free myself. I did it to save my life.

They may have abandoned me, but I still love them. Why? Because they are “my parents.”
