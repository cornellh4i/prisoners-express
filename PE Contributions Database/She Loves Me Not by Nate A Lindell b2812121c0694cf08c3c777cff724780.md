**“She Loves Me Not” by Nate A. Lindell**

*The Developing Mind* by Daniel J. Siegel soundly explains how our relationships with others determine the development of our human mind, how we view ourselves (*inter alia*), which determines how we live our lives (e.g. one who views himself as an unloveable coward will deem attempts to love him as scams). I was reading that book while pondering flowers and the women that topic brought to mind.

Siegel’s theory must deem romantic love not only a beautiful phenomenon, but beneficial to society: being loved can persuade the unlovable coward that he/she is lovable and thus to act loveable, precluding the harm of innocents. Siegel’s theory implies much more (e.g. that the warped relationships most prisoners were born into largely caused our maldevelopment into “criminals”, and prison’s obstruction of healthy relationships is bound to worsen us) but it and the word theme brought to mind the girl I was engaged to when I first came to prison.

We were friends, knew each other from church before my arrest. She admired me and I admired her (she was witty, a great singer and pianist, thoughtful, faithful, and of course, a ginger) and we expected to be a couple from first sight. But, I was convicted of murder, sentenced to life - because I expected as much. I first ignored the letters she flooded me with after my arrest. Her parents wrote, it was cool for me to write her and the was f’d up because I hadn’t. So, I wrote, intending to keep it friendly, something I’ve learned is impossible.

Man, she faithfully wrote me those cheery, personal letters that only someone who loves and trusts you can send.

Despite being convicted of murder, being surrounded by asshole staff and inmates, being betrayed by my long-twisted family, someone loved me, faithfully - she was blind to other men, men she could actually touch.

Expecting to win my appeal and the new trial, I proposed to that girl, if I won my appeal. She gleefully agreed.

She wasn’t a beauty queen, nor was she ugly or plain. But it was her personality and trust in me that blinded me to all other women (e.g. my cougar attorney, horny guards) - I felt no need for more than one woman! I could count on her forever, she proved that!

Surprise, surprise - the court denied my appeal, misstating the facts to justify it. *State v. Lindell*, 617 N.W.2d 500 (Ct. App. 2000). The decision was big news in the state, especially in my hometown; it was expected to go to the state’s Supreme Court.

Abby went silent - no mail from her for several weeks, a month, two months. Worried that she might’ve Julieted on me, I called her home. That’s when I found out how she’d been diagnosed with depression, prescribed enough psych. meds, didn’t go out with friends, refused offers to date, and that those good folks at church had blamed her for my falling away from church (of course it had nothing to do with those nuts trying to cast the devil out of a schizophrenic lady they picked up from a home for the mentally disabled, nor the cold shoulder the leadership gave me because I went to college, etc.) and killing someone, while her parents harassed her for being “too close” to me (apparently they didn’t know she was engaged to marry me.

Judging by the guilt trip she laid on me, Abby’s mom laid a whale of a one on Abby, maybe enough for her to need psych meds?

See now how Siegel’s theory about interpersonal relationships is relevant to this story?

I promised Abby’s parents that if Abby wrote and told me that she no longer wished to communicate, I’d respect that.

Three weeks later, such a letter arrived. In it, Abby rationalized parting ways by saying I’d betrayed my family, a real nut shot given the truth was the opposite. I guess she had to see me as bad so she wouldn’t feel like she was doing me wrong - I’d rather she found a tolerable man out there and remained friends.

Twas a scratch, just a scratch. Life went on; I prepared for the WI Supreme Court.

Until then, I’d sidestepped the nitwits around me who occasionally tempted me to whoop their ass with their sloppy conduct. I didn’t want to hurt Abby, look bad in her eyes. Then, sadly timed, some black dude with faulty biases about white people decided to spit on me (it’s a longer story…), which I was ready for. It was in the law library, and I chucked the law book I’d been holding, stuck him a couple times with the steel pen I’d been holding for that purpose. By the time it was over, all he’d managed to do was bleed all over me and the law library, and bite my stomach while I smothered him and wrapped his limbs up.

Not bragging about wrecking that fool, although he brought it upon himself. But, I’m sure I’m not the first prisoner who was restrained by loving relationships from going Hellraiser on someone. Not that Abby should feel guilty about that, the system however, should feel guilty.
