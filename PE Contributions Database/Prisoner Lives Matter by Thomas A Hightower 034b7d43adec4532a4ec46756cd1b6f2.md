**Prisoner Lives Matter by Thomas A. Hightower**

Prisons are a carcinogenic eco-disaster in mass. In my 25 ½ years of serving time on my current sentence, I have been housed at 6 different prisons. Every single one of these prisons had at least one carcinogen risk substance.

My liver cancer was not caused by my HCV, as I was cured of HCV more than 5-years before any cancer was diagnosed. Not to mention I got HCV from a used razor CDCR guards forced me to use (grooming standards), despite my protest that it was not my razor. We were not issued new razors each time. Instead, they used a pigeon hole box for us to store used razors in the cubby hole. All the time, these razors got mixed up. A 20 cent razor could have prevented my contracting HCV. I came down with jaundice 6 weeks after I had used this razor belonging to someone else. I have no tattoos, nor drug use. So no risk factors. This cost the state $150,000 just for drugs for HCV— 3 rounds of HCV drugs caused me so much suffering until the newest generation of drugs cured me of HCV. Then I contract end stage liver cancer 5 years after beating HCV.

I was housed at USPC valley state prison Chowchilla, which has arsenic in the water. SATF [Corcoran II] had water and air borne carcinogens in the agricultural chemicals crop dusters sprayed on fields and the prison yard as they made each pass, I contracted COPD after 6 months there.

I was housed at our medical prison CHCF Stockton wher 10 or more men I did 10 years or more with came down with the same cancer as me, only they all died. I’m awaiting death myself.

We are human beings. I’m a great grandfather, yet I’ve been locked away from family for 25 years. I’m close to parole— but how long will I live to enjoy life or say goodbye to my 10 grandkids and 6 great grandkids that I’ve never met.

Everyday another acquaintance enters this medical unit with end stage liver cancer metastasized to the lungs. Billions of dollars of healthcare costs, priceless human costs.

We are people too. “Prisoner’s lives matter.”

God bless you all.
