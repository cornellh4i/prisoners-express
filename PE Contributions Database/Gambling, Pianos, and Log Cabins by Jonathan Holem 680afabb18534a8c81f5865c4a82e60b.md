***Gambling, Pianos, and Log Cabins* by Jonathan Holeman**

****I would sit at that old piano trying to make sense of all the keys. Grandma would play classical pieces and teach me chopsticks. When I’d make up my own tunes and tones, fiddling with the pedals, she would laugh and go off to the kitchen where she’d make the most delightful treats. I’d bang out notes to form a song of my own that once completed, would be a masterpiece no one would ever hear. “Who’s banging on that piano?” my grandfather would call from the living room. I’d go in, and he would be watching any kind of sporting event. He also taught me to gamble. Of course, he would give me ridiculously great odds, and I’d always go home with a few dollars.

At another grandparents’ house, I sat and played with Lincoln Log cabins and Star Wars figures. That grandfather would play magic tricks and have a pocket in his flannel shirt full of Jelly beans. The little sweet Grandma would always be working as a nurse. She even showed me how to feed the big, white dog, Nikki, medicine in cheese.

Looking back at the gambling grandpa who taught me how to shoot a bow, wash a boat, ring out a wet rag, and mow a lawn, basically tricking me into doing chores, I wonder how he felt when his heart first gave out. Then I look back at piano playing grandma and her precious meals and music. What did she know about the future, the aches and pains all those old rough days would bring? When the magician died in his log cabin from Parkinson's Disease, did he remember to pack a pocket full of Jelly beans? Or when the little old lady who dedicated her life to fixing others, when her mind began to wander, did she recall any beautiful vacation, or just those years away from home in a blood-filled hospital?

Grandparents die. Sometimes they’ll leave you money, sometimes that will be stolen and you’ll never receive a dime. But the final finances are not what will live on. While money is nice, memories are all that matter in the vaults within the mind.

When your grandparents die, do you remember them as confused old people, or do you see the smile in those years of wrinkles? When you look at your parents, can you find the fear of aging in those eyes? Then in a mirror, can you see the grandparent you are, will be, or never will be, and cry?

Everyone dies. Some grow old; others are taken when they’re young. The things you own will flutter off to others and eventually turn to rubbish. Fears and hope will flicker away in the blink of an eye. Maybe a piece of you will escape to a land of bliss or sorrow, so what will you leave behind? Memories. You’ll live in other’s minds as a hero, a sad and lonely song, a tyrant, a thief, a killer, a friend, or another person just seeking happy times. Some will fade, never having had the experience of knowing a loved parent, grandparent, child, or friend. Death is the truth of the world. Some will write words upon a page that last, and others will create visions of beauty. Everyone wants to live forever, and some turn to hide in their minds, knowing that life may be pointless in the end. In all they teach us, good or bad, grandparents all have something we can watch and learn from as they age. They teach us what it means to age, to fade away, and pass on only to live in memory.
