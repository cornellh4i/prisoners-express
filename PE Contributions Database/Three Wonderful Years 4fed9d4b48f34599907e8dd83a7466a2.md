***Three Wonderful Years* by Carl Branson**

The year was 1966. Minimum wage was $1.00 per hour and it went up to $1.10. For this 16 year old high school sophomore, 5 or 6 years of scavenging Chicago’s alleys for discarded TVs and radios and figuring out how to make them work again was about to pay dividends. Yeah I was a “tech nerd” from the early years of grammar school.

It was a local family owned/operated TV-radio repair shop. The brothers who ran the place sort of knew me because I would occasionally buy parts from them to satisfy my hobby’s needs. I risked approaching them about a part-time job. They were hesitant at first--and who could blame them! Even then there was a bias that favored having some kind of formal education; be it a tech school certificate or the then rare high school specialty course. But rather than “blow me off”, they devised an “interview” that involved diagnosing equipment brought in for repair. All concerned were pleased by the end of this interview. I had a 3 month “probationary” job offer at $2.25 an hour (more than double minimum wage!) with the promise of going to $2.75 if I proved myself to their satisfaction.

Things were changing rapidly in the consumer entertainment field. The transistor was slowly but surely replacing the tried and true vacuum tube--more so in radios than TVs at first, the auto radio being among the first to make the change on a mass-market scale. I had been “playing” with transistors for a couple of years as a hobbyist, so this “new” style equipment really wasn’t much of a challenge.

The biggest “problem” that both my employers and I faced in the business was customer confidence. Again, the disbelief that a high-school teenager was qualified to repair their precious TV, radio, of “High-fi” tape/record player(stereo systems were just becoming common) was rampant, at least at first. The regular customers were the first to recognize and accept the quality of my work. It seemed that word spread and I almost became a curiosity, particularly with the senior citizen crowd.

As it turned out, the probationary period never matured. At two months my par rate went to $2.75; six months later it was $3.50. At a nominal 25 hours per week, I was “rolling in the dough!” This allowed me to expand my hobby interests and advance my career aspirations to become an electronics engineer on the cutting edge of technology. When I finally started dating (yeah, I was a *really* late bloomer socially), this also allowed me to be a bit more extravagant when it came to dinner/activity plans.

The one thing that was both the saddest and funniest things to happen during this job was when one of the brothers tried to “set me up” with his teenage daughter! Granted, she was a beautiful, personable blonde, but we just didn’t “click” romantically.
