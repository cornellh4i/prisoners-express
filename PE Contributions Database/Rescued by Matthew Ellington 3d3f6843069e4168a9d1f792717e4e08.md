**Rescued by Matthew Ellington**

It was a crush I had on my best friend during my junior year of high school that changed the course of my life.

There wasn’t anything that really set those high school years apart from much of my childhood, except we’d managed to stay in the same area for an unprecedented 3 years - long enough for me to come out of my bookish shell and develop my first solid friendships. For once, home didn’t seem like some foreign ideal. I felt like I belonged somewhere.

That place was at school, in the AFJROTC program. I’d originally signed up my freshman year just to fill a required elective. Three years later, they were my family - a cadre of semi-serious student soldiers, unified in our shared sense of purpose, but also by the fact we were normal teenage kids with normal teenage problems.

When I met Christie, we were both freshman cadets and I was infatuated with her almost from the start. She was beautiful and popular, with this ebullient personality that disturbed the air around her - like lightning as it strikes the earth. Long before I could fathom the confidence to do anything else, I accepted a spot in her “friend-zone” and did whatever I could just to be able to spend time with her. For the most part, this entailed multi-hour marathons of *Friends* on her living room couch. Her family grew accustomed to my constant presence, and before long, I grew to cherish their loud, slightly eccentric, yet loving home as much if it were mine.

In stark contrast, my own home life seemed anything but stable. Poverty had been as constant in my life as my father’s absence. My mom battled constantly with low-wage jobs to keep my brother and I fed, but the strain was manifesting itself in ways I’d never noticed when I was younger: drugs, alcohol, various sexual relationships. When she stopped being able to work because of physical disability my sophomore year, I got a part-time job at the McDonald’s on the naval base on the other side of town to try to fill the gap.

One day, I came home to my mom crying and the news that we were being evicted. We were 3 months behind on the rent and had no one to ask for help. My mom started talking about the possibility of homeless shelters and I knew it was real.

I cried and cried as I told Christie how I was probably going to have to drop out to support my family. We hugged each other tightly, trying to squeeze the broken pieces of my life back together. Then something unexpected happened.

Christie’s mom, overhearing my situation, sat me down and gave me an invitation to live with them through my senior year; to have the chance to graduate without the burdens I’d been facing. I didn’t know what to say. These people owed me nothing, and yet, they were fully inviting me into their home - into their family.

That last year of high school was tumultuous in its own way. Unfamiliar home expectations, coupled with my ever prevalent sense of abandoning my mom and the tricky technicality of turning 18 made me about as insufferably rebellious as a teenager could be.

Still, they treated me like one of their own and gave me the support to graduate - without which, I honestly don’t know where I’d be. I still talk to Christie and her family over a decade later, especially her mom - the women who rescued me by letting me into her family.
