**“Why are You Looking at Her When You Have Me?” By Leonard Marquez III**

“Are you kidding me? You’re holding my hand and you look at her. Do you not think about my feelings?” she said.

‘How do I explain this to her, when I don’t even understand?' he thought.

The pain, misery, jealousy and breakups. How do you explain to someone who doesn’t know? Bad choices over sexuality, having the perfect girl yet not satisfied. These are some of the symptoms of bipolar. To have the feelings of grandeur, feel all important. Sometimes before she says what's wrong with him, stop and see if something is “wrong” with him. Take him somewhere and talk, find out what is going on. You see, I know the before and after of bipolar 2, when not treated and when treated. The difference is like night and day, you see the world differently, you finally have control. So before you have the pain, misery, jealousy and breakup find out if there are things you can do to fix it.
