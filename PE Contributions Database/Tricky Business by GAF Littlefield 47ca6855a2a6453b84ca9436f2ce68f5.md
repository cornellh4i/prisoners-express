**Tricky Business by GAF Littlefield**

It’s a Tricky Business doin time. It helps to remember, it’s not just a job, it’s an adventure. My initials stand for give a fuck, but some days I just don’t and I go for laughs instead. However, Gary has said “keep it real!” So, really you might not g.a.f that my name is Gigi. Just another drop of water in an infinite sea… a hot robot... Ariel had a warrant and no previous ID, Fairchild married a dude that died from metastasized lung cancer. LittleField. Queen of the run on and on and on… Got some manufactured probable cause, a prior with Cali’s strike law times three for a grand total of 125 years to life, guilty of innocence, and I’d been up all night crying thinking I was getting 25 to life, by the time they got to the total all I could say was, “I guess that means I’ll be… what? Like a hundred and sixty-five when I parole?” It’s a tricky business… and it’s important to remember… things change all the time… God is good… thank you for reminding us… Carl, Gus, and more… sharing memories, Mark, don’t just pick up any old snake… close calls William, Douglas make our hearts break.

Everyone holding grudges, everyone letting them go, doctor looking the dog In ourselves in the eye and company, sending up smoke signals and just doing what you can Catherine and all the rest that may need a little music in your lives. I’m here to lend a “Helping Hand” but it is a “close call” since it’s already 2 days away from the 1st of July. Brothers and “Sisters.”

My album recommendation is by the band Everlast: “ Whitey Ford’s house of pain” Especially for those of you born by the river in a little tent… I love Greta Van Fleet too. I saw them on SNL a few months ago… she reminds me of a 360 rainbow… N.E. wax… thanks everyone… and Prisoner Express… I’m looking forward to more good reads.
