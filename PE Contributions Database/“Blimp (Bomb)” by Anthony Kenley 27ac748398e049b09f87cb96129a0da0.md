**“Blimp (Bomb)” by Anthony Kenley**

Aw! Heck! Come on man! I told you, moron. “There is no easy money.” “Oh yeah! Man, they want us to paint the bomb in the air so it’ll dry faster.” Special paint

Dude! Shut up! Great view my eye! The view is getting closer every second dummy. We’re about to get a real close up.

I wonder if we can flip this thing over so we land on it instead of it on us?
