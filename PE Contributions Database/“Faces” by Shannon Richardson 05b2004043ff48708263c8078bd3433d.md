**“Faces” by Shannon Richardson**

What do you see when you look at someone’s face? Age? Personality? Emotion? To me, faces are about so much more. I have always been fascinated by people’s faces. Perhaps it’s because I have an identical twin who shares my face.

Growing up, I remember thinking how cool it was that I shared a face with someone else. Our parents were the only ones who could tell us apart - but sometimes they couldn’t either. Our family members always got us mixed up.

School was especially fun with a twin. We switched places all of the time. Our friends never knew. Our teachers never knew. We tricked them all.

Although our faces were identical, our personalities couldn’t be more different - I was always the troublemaker. I always pushed the limits and wanted to see how far I could go. My twin, on the other hand, was the calm one. He was always so rational.

Jerry loved to learn and took tests for the both of us. He’s the biggest reason I was able to graduate high school. He was the brain for us both. I wasn’t stupid, though. Not in the slightest. I simply chose to focus on things other than school. I was always obsessed (or so Jerry said) with people’s faces, but it began to go beyond that. When I found a face that fascinated me, it was all I could think about. I wanted to be that person. I wanted to know how it felt to be in their world.

The first time I killed someone, it was accidental. I was twenty-three years old when I met a man at a supermarket. His face was what caught my eye, so I struck up a conversation with him. Most people will tell you their whole life story if you give them the chance. I found out that he worked at home and lived alone. I was living in an apartment with Jerry and two other people. I was working a hectic job that required a lot of interaction with others. I began wondering what it would be like to live in such peace. I followed the guy home, made my way into his house, and tied him up in his basement. How was I to know he was severely diabetic? I just wanted to be him for a little while.

Jerry did what he always did - he kept me out of trouble. When someone placed me at the scene of the crime, he was my alibi. At that point, our parents were both gone, and Jerry was in medical school. He felt I was having an identity crisis, but I disagree. I know who I am, I always have, but I want to know how it feels to be someone else.

It has been thirty-two years since that day at the supermarket. I have lived a full life - fifty-eight of them, to be exact. It is no longer enough to take over a person’s entire existence. I want to really be that person.

They call me the faceless identity killer. They say that the crime is always the same, but the description of the face of their suspect is always different. The gender changes from male to female. I really have them stumped. Boy, am I glad Jerry decided to be a plastic surgeon!

The face you see on my hands remains the same. It’s the face I share with Jerry. I had it put on my hands so I will never forget who I really am. It’s the face beneath that will change as the life I decide to live changes.

Today, I am Sam, a computer programmer from Brooklyn. I have a dog named Lucy and a best friend named Jerry.

Tomorrow, I just may be you.
