I am covered completely with guilt, you know. At least that is what they tell me. I only know truth when admit to a lie because it is what sets me free. I am only a number confined to a room of the insanity of my mental spaces, small tightening around me. Much to my chargin, the fingers of this horrid thing they say I have done, I woke to like a nightmare, not really believing this to be truth. Not believing it to be true of someone like me. They didn’t ask me if I believed it or not, nor they ask themselves whether or no they believed it or not. I know I would be remiss in allowing myself to be filled with these things, these lies. But how unfortunate it seems they always have some type of evidence. . . only mine is so damning, damaging its impossible for me to deny it.

Does a person change their stars when they are so stricken with guilt? Can they be anything other than what people say they are, believe it or not? I don’t even to this day believe it. I don’t know what I believe, but it could never be this. I am one of a different quality and calibur. I choose to be differently. . .The guilt hovering over me like a plague waiting to infest my every part. . . piece. . . fiber. . . thoughts. . .I can not remember what happened so what is truth to me even now is believable even to my own disgusted dismay.

Who am I? Who was I? Who will I be if not this creature I am? But I am no will to do otherwise but give into the ugliness I became and continue to grow in monstrousity. Abhorrant is my own nature so much that I can not dispute even in a minute amount the realty that what they say of me is truth. How could it be when my heart it self is so good? When my logical thinking isn’t even in alignment with such disgusting things? Even now as these letters press upon the page I can not believe I would be anything less than this.

I have been a scholar of the old world for ages it seems. In the past we can learn much of where we are meant to go in the future and this fact alone has always enticed me. I would not deny I had passion for the sciences themselves. Such things you could do when you are driven by ambition, selfish or otherwise. Doesn’t one’s mind simply distort their own passion and leave room insanity, this and a vast many other things. I am guilt of this AND have been for so long I think and now know this to be truth that I no longer know who I am anymore. I have lost the exact day in which these changes took place. I only know that I can no longer hide what I have done. . .

If I told you would you think highly of me, or would you grab your weapons in a effort to slay the beast I have become. . . Some would think me a demon. . . others an angel. I am neither. Yet, I have a hunger so great any body with warm blood moving though its veins pushes my hunger in rapid flow to the very forefront of my mind, where I am driven mad by my own need of it. These wings, that remain attached to my shoulder blades are attached in a way no worded description can render with honesty. However, their beauty alone remains unrivaled even now. I have used their beauty to lure people to their deaths and have no memory of such events. But they have the evidence, they have the desmembered fragments, they have these decaying bodies. Everyone is accounted for.

Believe it or not, I am no angel or devil. For one I wake up I know the most heart stricken guilt that I flee without looking back from the nightmarish actions which lead me to kill them. . .

I’m caught. . . young. . . deaf. . . blind. . . hindered. . . guilty. . .angry. . .demented. . .the monsterother monsters hide from. . .the scarred one. . .the tattooed clown. . .the jester in a circus. . .on stage. . .hidden behind a mask. . .wearing a facade. . .hiding my pain. . .searching for answers. . .missing people. . .fading away. . .lost at sea. . .tormented inside. . .hide agonies. . .want forgiveness. . .long for peace. . .need freedom. . .count the fading memories. . .have too much blood upon my hands. . .remain heartless. . .strive for perfections. . .set goals. . .aim too high. . .ache for my children. . .write books. . .am intelligent. . .have few friends. . .hate the past. . .live in a pretend present. . .long for a beautiful future. . .have a halo. . .wear the devil on my shoulder. . .am a person. . .cry tears. . .know fears. . .waste nothing. . .take for granted no one. . .love openly. . .chreish honesty. . .respect integrity. . .search for others like me. . .am like by many. . .loved by few. . .hated by noe one. . .serve God. . .seek myself. . .
