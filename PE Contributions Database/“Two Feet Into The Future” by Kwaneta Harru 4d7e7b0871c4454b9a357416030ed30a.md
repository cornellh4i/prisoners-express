**“Two Feet Into The Future” by Kwaneta Harru**

We wanted to memorialize bringing our son home from the hospital in a way we could share with him when he was a curious five and embarrassed at fifteen.

The typical nude shot on the blanket during broth time just wouldn’t do. My husband was changing our son out of his going home outfit into a more comfortable “I’m at home” one when I grabbed the camera. My hulk of a husband’s gentlemen and fluid movements were what I intended to capture or film, to highlight how his paternal instincts had taken over his macho and now our fragile child was completely safe and comfortable in the hands that cleanly conveyed love and safety.

Some days later, reviewing the photos, we both stopped on a simple shot of our son’s tiny feet cradled in my husband’s hefty hands. We both wondered: Where would these feet take me? How many miles of adventurous trekking would be upon these soles? Who would be the mom filling in these feet in years to come? My silly spouse guessed if he’d be a tennis shoe on a loafer type of mom.

“Why not both?” I asked.

I pointed out that the photo also conveyed that this perfect little human being, OUR perfect little human being began with his life literally in our hands. So more importantly than what he would do, what would we do? How could we ensure he made a difference? How would our parenting shape his childhood and what lessons would he learn simply from watching us?

That photo won out over all others; it is now framed and among the array of other family photos on the montel. Those two tiny feet, embraced by love, were our hope for the future.
