**Secrets by Shannon Richardson**

Look at her! She’s so focused on herself and her own secrets that she doesn’t see anything around her. My name is Leslie. That’s my sister, Christy, with a cigarette in her mouth, deep in thought. We have always been extremely close, or so I thought.

A few months ago, I was sick with the flu. My fiance, Jared, worked all day, so my sister came over during the day to take care of me. She was so thoughtful, she would even spend the night-- just in case I needed her, she said.

After a few days, I was feeling much better. I finally had my appetite back and was starving, but I didn’t want to bother Jared or Christy. When I walked into the living room, I got the shock of my life. Jared and Christy were completely naked, doing things I only wished he would do for me.

I was devastated. What was I supposed to do? Two of the most important people in my life had betrayed me - in my house! I had myself convinced that this was a one-time occurrence and it would never happen again. I tried to act as though nothing had changed. But for me, everything had changed.

I quickly found out that this was no one-time fling as I had once thought. Christy spent more and more time at my house because Jared lived there too. She would “just happen to be in the neighborhood” so often that she now used my spare bedroom as her own. They thought I was stupid. You can call me many things, but stupid is not one of them.

I overheard them this morning. They are secretly planning to run off and slope this weekend. Look at her planning her life with my fiance. Poor fools. That cigarette in her mouth? If only she knew that was the last one she would ever have. Cigarettes are so easy to lace.

While poor Jared is secretly mourning the “love of his life,” my sister, I will let him know that I’m pregnant. How could they not notice? Oh, that’s right, they’ve been busy. Once Jared gets used to, and even excited about, my being pregnant, I will have to let him in on my own little secret. The baby I am carrying...is his father’s.
