**by Robert Neely**

My neighbor Jaime had the biggest crush on Jaraine, my eldest sister. She was aware, but since she was already in high school, she was above it. Jaime would find all sorts of creative ways to get her attention. He did some of her chores, picked honeysuckle for her, and even crooned some sappy love song during one of my mother’s famous karaoke nights. If they were both about ten years older, I’m sure he would have been better off.

As it was, Jaraine was awful to the poor boy. She shot down his every advance and quite verbally made it known how much she disliked him.

The week before school started, our things were all set out and we knew exactly what we were going to wear. I’ll never forget poor Jaime walks up to my porch, spiffy as all, and asks, “Where’s Jaraine?” He was wearing all his new school clothes and had just had his haircut in a pretty decent look.

Jaraine comes out on the porch, and Jaime asks “What do you think?” “About what?” “Well, I got all new clothes!” “”Hmm, nice.” Jaraine turns to go, but Jaime calls after her, “Wait! What about my hair?” She looks at him and as smugly as possible, says, “Oh, that’s nice. What’d ya do, wash it?” She walks away, and the crestfallen boy never tried to impress her again.
