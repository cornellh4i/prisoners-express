**“Freedom” by Richard Schmidlkofer**

I’m alone, looking out of my window, seeing the freedom that scares me, frustrates me, and excites me.

It scares me when I look out this window, because I’ve been locked up for 24 years, and I still have 10 years left. I do not know freedom. It has changed so much and the outside world is fast and new to me. I will be lost and lonely. Nobody will accept me out there or will help me even though I’m prepared with resources and have done so much in here to show them I have changed.

It frustrates me when I look out this window, because I have missed so much of my life since I’ve been locked up. I have missed my family and friends. I lost everything and I miss my mother, my aunt, my great-aunt, and stepmother who I have never seen. I could not say bye to them when they died. I have to start over again. I know I will be frustrated trying to get a job and a place to live. I WILL NOT GIVE UP!! That’s what the world wants me to do.

It excites me when I look out this window because I’M FREE. It is my freedom and independence. I see success, not failure. I see people that will help me. It will take maybe several tries. I do not see prison bars. I do not have to deal with bullshit with inmates and staff.

I see through this window a future in my life. I see a new life and a changed life with positive people in my life. I know I can’t do this all by myself. I need Jesus (Holy Spirit) to guide me through our future and have a foundation of a church that will help me when I look through this window.
