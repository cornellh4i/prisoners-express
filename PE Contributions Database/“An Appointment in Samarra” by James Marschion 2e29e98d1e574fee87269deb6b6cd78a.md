**“An Appointment in Samarra” by James Marschion**

This story takes place ages ago, when mythical creatures walked among men…

A great sultan was sitting upon his throne, meditating on the mysteries of the universe, when one of his servants came racing into the room.

“Master!” he cried. “I have had a terrible fright this morning! I was at the market bartering with a fruit vendor when I glanced over my shoulder and saw Death! She gave me such a frightful look that I ran from the marketplace. I fear she has come for me.”

“And?” asked the sultan. “What do you propose to do about this?”

“If you would lend me your fastest horse I could travel across the desert and be in Samara tomorrow, far from the reach of Death.”

The sultan considered this and said, “So be it. Take my fastest horse and flee to Samara.”

The servant raced to the stables and rode away on the sultan's fastest horse.

The sultan sat and pondered the situation for some time. He could not have his servants racing off to the far corners of the world at random times. So he decided there was only one thing he could do–he would question Death himself.

So, he summoned his horseman to bring his most regal horse and gallantly trotted to the market.

Spotting her rather easily, the sultan hopped off of his horse and gave her a quick bow.

“Death?” he asked, “Why did you give my servant such a frightful look this morning? The poor man is terrified.”

“I apologize,” said Death. “I was surprised to see him here today as I have an appointment with him tomorrow in Samara.”
