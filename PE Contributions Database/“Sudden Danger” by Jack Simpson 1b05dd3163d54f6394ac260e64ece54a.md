**“Sudden Danger” by Jack Simpson**

Traveling has always been important to me. One who sits without adventures is dull. I really wanted more out of life than just to read about it. Guess I have an adventure bug. Trains have always caught my interest.

I do have what they call the travel itch. My feet won’t let me sit still long. Even building things, it had to be done now. Not next week. My mind would race faster than my hands would produce it.

My shoes tied, the adventure would begin. The old tracks behind my house seemed the best place of all. The rails were now rusty and hadn’t seen usage in years. My body was in mode and my feet hit the tracks with a quick pace.

The gravel was old and was almost covered with patches of grass. I had to remind myself it is still snake season. I had thought about that before I left. A strong wooden stick about six feet long and one inch thick would handle any snake. At least I hope it would. My worst fear was Bobcats. They are so allusive.

The wack did some good. My legs loosened up and felt great. I really enjoy nature. What that is seen by walking is missed by those who travel by train. Everyone I know who travels by train is too in depth with conversation to enjoy the beauty. It mimics what you only see on TV.

Three hours in my walk, I came upon a bridge made out of truss. It looked solid and with one foot trying my weight, my confidence built strong enough to go forward, my hopes were high now.

The sun high over head, my body needed energy and rest. The pack on my back had four days’ rations, along with two canteens full of water that had been frozen. What else could a person want.

Hours went by and the sun was on its downhill motion. The stars would be my roof and the ground, my bed. For those who love the outdoors, this is like home. Better than a room at the Hilton. Should I be lucky enough, I just might see a few shooting stars. That would be great.

The sky was just getting a little hue to it. Time to make tracks, our motto in the South. If you camp in the woods, you leave it just like you found it. No trash, foot prints, and no burning embers. We lose so much forest due to people not caring.

The tracks were taking on a strange shape to them as I ventured on. I like to use V.W.R. (visual walking rules), not to mixed up with V.F.R. (Visual Flying Rules) -- what pilots use. Here in the woods, you have to watch where you step and stay focused on your surroundings. I hope it isn’t too complicated. For every step a person takes, a snake could be close by.

The fog laid heavy on the tracks. I really felt this could be the reason for the odd shape. My pace slowed. If you have even had the hair on the back of your neck stand up, you will follow your instinct and back pedal. I felt lured to travel forward. The fog just didn’t seem like it was going to burn off. Now my chest began to burn and I noticed my breathing was fast. I tried my best to control it and still walk. Something just wasn’t right.

Get off the tracks and out of the fog. There in my body, I could sense the sudden danger. Almost all the time, my feelings are right. Through my shoes, my feet felt the vibration. My fear of an earthquake flashed through me. The trees seemed stable enough.

My feet were well off the tracks now. I barely could make it out. A train that I knew hadn’t been on these tracks in years. This train showed no signs of slowing. A sound of picking up speed told me I didn’t want to be close.

The tracks, as I glanced down, still showed rust. I know for sure I saw this train. Even felt the wind from it. Really glad my feet moved and I was out of the way. It sure would have torn me apart.

I headed back home. This was one adventure that was over by Sudden Danger.
