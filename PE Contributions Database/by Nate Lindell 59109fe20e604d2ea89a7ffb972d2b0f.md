In Green Bay, home of the Packers, sits max security G.B.C.I, with one of Wisconsin’s worst solitary confinement units (R.H.U). I was sent here on 9 Oct. 2018, after an i/m in W.S.P.F.’s seg unit stabbed me in the back of my head several times, put in the cell I’ve drawn.

On 17 Oct., an i/m living in one of these cells, fatally hung himself. Self mutilation, hangings, overdoses, are daily events. Aaron Pavin went through 11 units of blood in a week from cutting himself. My neighbor, Ronald Walker, is covered in scars from suicide attempts. I/Ms yell insults when I try to discuss litigation and a guard named Alan Potts accused me of gang activity for such!

After 24 days, I still haven’t been given my legal papers. Admin complaints are ignored.

Recreation: outside, roofless, concrete-wall cells, so high no sun touches us - twice/week, 1 hr.

Food: no fresh fruit, veggies mostly canned; grains mostly refined - I lost 10 lbs since arrival (186 to 176 ilbs- I’m 6’5”)

Visits: only over T.V. screen, once/week- must call 920-432-3262 and schedule two days in advance

Medical Care: horrible- vertigo made me fall, hit my head several times, ignored by nurses, denied toradol prescribed by hospital, taken off anti-depressants w/out psych seeing me; psychiatrist and nurses refused to see me b/c I politely asked guards to keep body cams on, record their misconduct

Property: no pens (used to cut selves), only rubber pencils. Those who manage to stay out of trouble, go on Admin. Conf., get all of their electronics (T.V., radio, typewriter, razor- I only have a T.V.), can buy some snack food- all can have 8 of their books and 8,000^3 inches of paperwork.

Psych staff only see those who act nuts, attempt suicide

No outdoor view from most cell

Call in your concerns about my/our treatment at 920-432-4877. Cpt Jay VanLanen runs the seg. unit.

Please help me fight this by ordering blank paper and postage- embossed envelopes from JLMarcusWisconsin.com

Debts preclude me from buying my own
