***Rain Mixed Pain* by Shane Brewer**

Her eyes are so beautiful at first fight I’m in love.

The whole scenery is pure. Amazing, you’re pure beauty.

I can’t look away. I’m afraid of what I’ll miss.

I see the pain in rain, the sound of a broken heart,

the cries you’ve once had alone in your room.

Dance with me in the rain. That’s how life should be.

The storm means nothing to me. Why would it?So let’s go into the storm and dance in the rain.
