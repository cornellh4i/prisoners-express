**“Death Perception” by Robert Andrew Bartlett Sr.**

****The old medicine man had severe glaucoma. One eye still had much of the same mischievous sparkle I remembered from the old days. The other was cloudy and dim with an indistinct faded iris and a shallow, lifeless pupil. It wandered sometimes. His left eye would stare unblinking into yours, making you feel nervous, exposed and guilty. The right one would stare blankly into space. I used to wonder what it saw, if it saw anything at all.

I asked him about it once.

That was a big mistake.

We were both drunk at the time. At least I was. He had drunk much more than I had--he always did--but he still seemed ready to climb an unfinished skyscraper and walk the high steel as he’d done in his younger days as a welder. In the morning--or was it afternoon?--when I had that hangover, I would deeply regret my importance and firmly resolve not to be so nosey in the future.

I made many resolutions that day. I’ve even kept some of them. He cheerfully acknowledged that his eyes weren’t what they’d been twenty years before. His diminishing vision was the main reason he’d retired early (as soon as he reached 65 years old), but he assured me that he could still see things younger men could not.

My own vision was slightly impaired at that hour-tunnel vision, differently focusing, sensitivity to bright light… but I was always ready to accept a challenge when I was “under the influence.” That trait has almost got me killed more than once. (That’s one reason I don't drink anymore.)

“Close your good eye,” I said. At least I tried to. My tongue was dry and feeling fuzzy. So I may not have pronounced “close” very well. Perhaps I told him to put clothes on his eyes. Anyway, he seemed to understand.

He even put his hand over his eye. Then I realized he had closed his clear eye, the one that had been fixing me with it’s unblinking gaze. The older eye was wandering off somewhere in his left. Before I could protest, he told me what he saw.

He started with my fears and my nightmares. Then he told me about my hopes and my fondest dreams. He spoke of thoughts and feelings I’d never share with a woman much less a crazy old man.

He stripped my soul naked and left it lying on the floor. My friends say I passed out from too much whiskey and beer.

Maybe so, but sometimes I think it was my self-defense.
