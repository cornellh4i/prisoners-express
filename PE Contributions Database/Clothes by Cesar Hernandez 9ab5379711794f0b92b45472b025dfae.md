**Clothes by Cesar Hernandez**

We all have to protect ourselves but the question is, how? We all construct walls that we believe are castles, though they slowly turn into prisons, because we can’t wall out pain and sorrow and loss.

We protect ourselves from the intensity of life by retreating into the inner dimension. There, we wait in the world of being for the storm to disperse. In this way, our castle has clear walls. We often take our walls with us and think we’re free, even though we’re clunking around in a suit of armor that makes life burdensome. Armor, no matter how thin or clear, keeps the air from touching the skin. It keeps aliveness from touching the heart. Withdrawal and accommodation, turning away and aiming to please, become plates of armor that can prevent us from living our lives.

We tell ourselves that withdrawing is staying calm and balanced, while accommodating is meeting others with no preferences. There is a crucial difference between acquiescing to the demands of others and cooperating with life. Moving through our fears doesn’t mean we have to absorb or placate the demands of others. Facing our pain doesn’t mean we have to withdraw from what comes our way. On the contrary, we need to open the ancient doors of our own making and let life kiss us on the forehead.

Ironically, our reflex to keep out what we fear often comes too late. When we realize we’re afraid, the fear is already inside us. Mysteriously, feelings move more quickly than the mind’s want to stop them. By the time we try to wall out these feelings, the pain is already poking at us. The worry is already breaking down our clarity. The anger is already stirring up our bottom. The sadness is already straining our hearts.

Putting up walls only walls in what’s ready to pass through us, if we would only let it out. The truth is, the only way out is through. When we resist what’s already moved inside us, we intensify all the difficult feelings by trapping what we resist in our tension.

The only way we can mitigate these feelings is to let the experience of being human move on through. For the most part, walls are useless. It’s meeting the sensations of being alive that cleanses us and shapes us, the way fast currents scour the bottom of a river, making the river stronger.

We need to be porous, so that other lives can reach us and fill us. This means we have to learn to neither shut ourselves down nor give ourselves away. Whether we lived behind walls of our own making or put down our armor depends on how we close and open. We close when we’re hurt or afraid. Open when pain goes away or we’re held and loved back into life. Closing and opening are both necessary, like inhaling and exhaling. Day by day, we’re called to stay open to the life of feeling while not letting pain, fear and worry shut down our heart. When we stop opening our soul to the world, we become burdened.

When closing makes us insular, we tighten and miss the depth in everything. We start to become wall-builders. We start to hammer our armor into place. This is the cost of closing without opening. When we can open into what feels real and true, especially after great fear or pain, our hearts widen like inlets and we ready ourselves for grace, however it might appear. These rhythms of closing and opening are constant. Staying in relationship to both is a constant struggle in which we’re asked to trust our own experiences while listening to the truths of others.
