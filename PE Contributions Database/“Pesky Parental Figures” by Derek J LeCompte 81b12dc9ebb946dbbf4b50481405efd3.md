“Pesky Parental Figures” by Derek J LeCompte

A couple of months ago, I lost my father to lung cancer. It hurt, but is magnified by the fact I’ll lose my mother soon to multiple other cancers. Now, that’s not the focus of this writing, but to give you a sense of why I’ve been flipping through my memories to find a few to share.

You see, my parents were an odd pair. It’s hard for me to even describe. The word “weird” doesn’t even fit.

Let’s start with my mother. She was a hippie who even when I turned 14, still had her feather-clad roach clip for her joints. So, much of her life she’s been all free-love, openness, and let the world dictate how things will end up. She had outfits I’d never seen her wear, a guitar I’d never seen her play and I’ve never seen her wear makeup a day in her life, nor ever do her hair. To me it seemed like a mess, just like her employment history.

My father is my mother’s polar opposite. A lover of Elvis and country music, with everything over-managed and tidy. He was very self-conscious and loved to comb his hair a lot and made sure he was always clean shaven. He always wore sunglasses, but not because he wanted to look cool, but because he was blind in one eye and detested when people would stare into its whiteness. His life was all about work, alcohol, and being grumpy. If it wasn’t one of those things, then he didn’t care.

Now, whoever said that opposites attract never met my parents. I can rifle though every memory I have and won’t find a single one of them together or happy. To the contrary, they truly hated one another. Being a product of that chaos made my life hell. In a way, their hatred for each other fell on me. I guess each one saw part of the other in me, which made them hate parts of me. It rang especially true when it came to actions. My mother dated a lot of abusive men, of all types. Where I’d be six years old through ten years old trying to fight them off of her, she wouldn’t show the same care by letting them actually turn on me. In a way, I always thought she did nothing because she saw my father in me and enjoyed seeing him get beat. For my father, it was utter neglect. I can count on both hands how many times he’s told me he loved me. Then, on my toes I can count how many times he’d told me I was a mistake while he was drunk.

Ultimately, this all led to them discarding me like a piece of unneeded furniture while in my teens. It was on eto the other, and then on my own far sooner than I was prepared for.

The strange part is that I never stopped loving them. I never resented them or hated them. All I wanted was to have them love me and be proud of me. Despite being in prison, I believe I’m okay despite being the product of such chaos. I love them and that’s a pesky thing. Sure, I wish they were better, like the love of my life and soulmate who is the most amazing mother I’d ever seen. But, we can’t have everything

Yes, I love my parents unconditionally. Before my father passed, which was sudden, I would’ve thought I’d take it well. However, when I got the news I cried like a six year old and my legs gave out. Part of me died, and I still feel that. Now, knowing my mother isn’t far behind hurts and I try to prepare myself, but there is no prep for that. I love her and I miss her already.

My only solace is that I picture them still at each other’s throats in Heaven, being restrained by the angels.

I love you Mom and Dad.
