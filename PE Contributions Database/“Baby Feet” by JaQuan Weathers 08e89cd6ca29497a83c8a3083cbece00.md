**“Baby Feet” by JaQuan Weathers**

Looking at this picture my mind drifts in the desires of fatherhood. Oh, how faith tells me about the sweet fruits I’d enjoy from infancy to adulthood. Everywhere in between and beyond, my child's life will be a great joy to me. I’ve dreamed of being a father for years. I think no other joy can compete with looking into the eyes of my seed, holding my child in my arms, letting my dear baby girl or boy hear my heartbeat, hearing his or her heartbeat. Oh, the joy. Almost every person who has a kid or kids would have me believe my desires make me naive. And would say “I don’t know what I’m in for,” as if to scare me or something. But there’s nothing about the responsibilities from 0 to 18 and furthermore that’s going to change how I feel. The excitement I feel at this very moment thinking and writing about it have me smiling.

Look I remember, about four to six month in my 11th-grade year in high school I was dating a young woman by the name of Claudia Magladiagla (God I hope I spelled her last name right), and one day as I was walking through one of the halls of our school, I felt something on my right hand. I had this urge to turn to my right and look down. But when I did, it was like I walked into a twilight zone. I saw a little girl holding my hand. I wasn’t shocked. I didn’t ask myself “who is this little girl?” and “why is she holding my hand?” I knew who this little girl was. I knew why she was holding my hand. She was my baby girl. I was her father and I was taking her to see her mom. I smiled as I looked at her cute little calm face, but a few steps after I looked up I exited the twilight zone. I stop. The feeling of a little girl’s hand in mine was no longer there. I look to where she was and my baby girl was gone. I knew what I was, I knew what I felt. But I also knew that what I had just experienced was not quite real. What that was a difficult pill to swallow because it felt so real. Her cute little face. Her small soft hand. Her smile. Oh, the way she smiled was so bright and full of energetic life. But the stillness of her was what let me know she was a good child. The wild part was I was not dreaming when this happened to me. That feeling wouldn’t let me cry. So instead, I smiled knowing one day we’ll meet.

So looking at this picture sent me on a sentimentally weird ride. I thought about the dreams I did have of me having children. I started to daydream about my having children after I looked at it. But when I came out of the daydream I wrote this poem:

*A part of me*

You were never a mystery to me.

You’ve always been deeply embedded in my thoughts

My feelings

Infiltrating my dreams

Invoking emotions so strong there was no question

I knew soon we’d meet

Soon, I’ll hold you in my gaze

Soon, I’ll embrace your tiny hands and feet

Soon, I’ll lay you on my bare chest as we

Connect breaths

And as my heartbeat soothes you to sleep

Yours brings me joy

The joy of knowing

That this heartbeat

Has been and always will be

A part of me
