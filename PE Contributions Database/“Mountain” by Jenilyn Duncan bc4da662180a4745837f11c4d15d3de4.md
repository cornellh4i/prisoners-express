**“Mountain” by Jenilyn Duncan**

The country landmark tis said to be

a monument among the trees.

This wooden shack - a place called home,

Stands tall, proud and all alone.

Inside, there’s a dirt floor and a fireplace

and room to be desired more.

It’s comfy and cozy when the fire’s ablaze

One could get on a crocheting craze!

The bed has ropes and hay to lay on

It’s not too soft but something to pray on.

“Father bless me to sleep through the night and

keep me safe so the bed bugs won’t bite.

Help me stoke the fire so I can be warm

and keep us from wild animals or harm.”
