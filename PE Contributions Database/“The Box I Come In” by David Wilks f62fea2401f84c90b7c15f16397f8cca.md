**“The Box I Come In” by David Wilks**

I’m sitting here looking out over the world I was once part of and my once again join. There only remains a thin piece of glass between us. I am an “untouchable”. If I join the world again, for the rest of my life, I'll have to yell out “unclean, unclean”, to warn everyone I’m approaching. The glass keeps my infection from contaminating the world. It also prevents the world from harming me.

How magnificent it is to look out over the world. The wonders of life that are just outside my box. People in love. Families going through their ever-changing states. The “normalcy” of business, shopping, and dining. Yet, here I sit in my box yelling, “unclean.”

To stay in this box has its attractive points. There are others here that would also be required to yell out “unclean”. Like modern-day lepers, there are risks and requirements to cross the glass. Here in this box, we see each other differently. We see that we are humans that love and want to be loved. Yes, our choices caused us to participate in the world’s biggest game of time-out. Here in this box, we don’t have to face the judgment of those in the world past the glass.

But to step out … oh to step out of this box and wear clothes of my choosing. To smell the smells and wonders of life, to light a candle and drive a car. I would yell out “unclean” all the louder to lay under a tree in the grass watching the stars twinkle. I would leave this box behind with all the other modern-day lepers that are afraid of the world out there. The dance at some type of “normalcy”. To express love from a sincere heart.

I know I’ve put myself in this box. Inside this box, I’ve learned I’m frail. My behavior is the past was like a violent storm meant to water but instead destroyed those I loved.

This box has taught me self-control, love, humanity. I don’t know that I would’ve learned this anywhere else. Patience, kindness, humility. This is the box I come in. Yes, I’m “unclean”. So are many on the other side of this glass. The only difference is my sickness has been exposed and treated while many of theirs stay hidden. However, if they would take the chance to learn who I am, they may want to step on my side of the glass and be friends.
