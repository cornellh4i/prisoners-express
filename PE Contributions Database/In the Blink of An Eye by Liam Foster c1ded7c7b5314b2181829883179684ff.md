**“In the Blink of an Eye” by Liam Foster**

After 1.5 days of blissful mid-tour leave, in which I had gotten married to, at the time, the love of my life. I was content; I felt as if I found some peace in a world filled with chaos. When I came home I had felt lost and my new wife Kay, why she was my stabilization. Yet the time flew by and I had to return to Iraq. Although, this time I was not as eager as I was going over the first time.

I spent three days in transit, plane tides and helicopter lifts. Finally, I got to get back to F.O.B. sweet F.O.B. (Forward Operating Base), it was good to get back to normal. The tour started with the loss of three good friends and a close class myself, but my recent nuptials had inflated my spirits. I felt unstoppable, things had seemed to align for me. I was glad to get back to missions which for that first evening was routine patrols of I.A. check points (I.A. = Iraqi Army) north of our F.O.B.

I was a gunner on my humvee, so I would bring my M-240B machine gun, my M-4 and shotgun down, open up the vehicle, get everything set up, comms, water, snackfood, go bag, and extra ammo. Try to have the vehicle prepped and running 15 to 20 minutes before we roll out. A gunner’s responsibility is to ensure the safety of the occupants of my humvee, as well as the patrolling convoy. I am the first line of defense, since I am practically sitting on top of the vehicle, I can see everything around it, so I have to maintain constant vigilance looking for oddities that could be potential bombs, sniper points or ambushes.

So far this mission was just a routine patrol to check up on our iraqi counterparts, it was around 23:30-23:40 so I had night vision on as we travelled over the berm road. This far it was a quiet cool evening till it wasn’t. I was in the second vehicle scanning my sector of firem when I saw a flash, then the road gave way. Somehow I had dropped down into the humvee for it rolled 3 ½ times. My turret, the armor on top of the humvee was ripped off, my 240 bent like a banana, yet I remember nothing.

As soon as I saw the flash, my whole life flashed before my eyes in reverse. I felt all those emotions and feelings again till it faded into nothingness. I knew it was over, it was the greatest pain I’d ever felt, yet it was the most peaceful feeling I’d ever felt all at once. I woke up after being resuscitated, and my whole body hurt like hell. Those 2 to 3 minutes felt like hours. My coordination was screwed up, my helmet and wallet were found 90 meters away from where the humvee laid to rest. I had a .50 cal ammo box filled with full magazines sitting on my and when they got to me.

I was told I should be dead, I was the 3rd gunner to survive a blow over-roll over, that left me with P.T.S.D (post-traumatic stress disorder) and T.B.I (traumatic brain injury). But that moment changed my whole life, in the blink of an eye, I had lost and was given back my life only to lose it again to prison. But life is Fragile and if you are not careful, It can be lost literally in the blink of an eye.
