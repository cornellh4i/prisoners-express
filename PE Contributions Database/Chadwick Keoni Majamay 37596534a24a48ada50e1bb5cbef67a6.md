****How many of you remember your first haircut? I do, and boy, was I scared! I was on this ridiculous looking horse barber’s chair, thinking this guy is going to shave my head off! Funny? My mom was smiling at me and taking a picture -- was she mad? Here I am, while my head is shaved off, crying bloody murder while I’m being murdered.

The moment of my death comes while the blades cut into my, uh… I’m still alive! Then some black stuff comes tumbling down my shoulder. What is this?

The next minute, I’m in my mother’s arms, leaving that dreadful place.
