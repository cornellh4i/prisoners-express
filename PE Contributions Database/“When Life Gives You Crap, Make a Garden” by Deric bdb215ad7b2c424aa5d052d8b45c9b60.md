“When Life Gives You Crap, Make a Garden” by Deric Conn

At times, life throws a heap of shit that may seem unbearable your way. In trying times, you may feel like giving up and “throwing in the towel.” I have my own scars to prove I’ve had such moments in my life. My faith has shown me that anything that happens, whether good or bad, can be used for our good.

We might not fully understand why crap gets thrown our way, but we can choose to wallow in feces or we can use it as fertilizer to help a garden grow. I choose to make a garden, and to see the beauty even in the midst of my trials.

I am that garden, and I can only grow to maturity by allowing the crap in my life to make me a better person. And along with growth, weeds and thorns will try to grow with us, and try to choke us out. We have to be stronger than our circumstances, and even in prison, we must choose to grow and expand. That way, when we leave this seemingly God-forsaken place (trust me, God hasn’t forsaken any one of us), people won’t see the excrement-stained garments of our past. People will see a garden, beautifully planted and grown for change.

And to you that may not see the other side of freedom, do not lose heart. I believe in a God that can not only free from a sinful past, but in a God who can also give an eternal future.

May we all choose to use the crap in our lives to grow us into the garden we desire.
