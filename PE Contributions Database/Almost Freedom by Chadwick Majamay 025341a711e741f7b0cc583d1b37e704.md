**“Almost Freedom” by Chadwick Majamay**

It was April 30, 2012 and I was homeless and desperate. It was bordering on midnight and I hadn’t had an eight-hour sleep period since the day I had left prison some days and a month ago. I was desperate for a bed to sleep in for only just one night. It is this desperate night, which I remember vividly, that I wish I could revisit!

On the overpass bridge on a cold April evening over highway 80, where construction workers were doing their work, I sat observing the activity under me. For a minute or two I sat. The day was a content one before this desperate evening began; I had been relaxing and chowing down on some junk food while relaxing with my friend at Paradise Park.

Over to my left was Saint Mary’s Regional Hospital and over to my right was the stairway leading to the park. Who knows? Maybe this story would have led to my death if I chose the stairway on the left, who knows the possibilities. Well, I took the one on the right. I had heard people talking in the bushes and it kind of spooked me out. At this time I was contemplating if I should go to the hospital and play suicidal, in which case they would take me to the State Mental Hospital, where I would find my much needed rest.

But then I had the stolen personal information, which was then discovered during the inventory of my property. The desperation for sleep had overridden my instincts and all I could think of was sleep. I would like to have seen myself walking up the stairs to the park to crash on a bench.
