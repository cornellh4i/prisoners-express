**Catch and Release by Vaughn Wright**

She was wearing the shirt again. The one she bought me. Red plaid on cotton flannel, with pearl snaps down the front, on the cuffs and breast pockets. She bought it from a secondhand store, I think. Paid fifty cents or something for it. Always looking to save a buck. But then she appreciated the value of a dollar more than I ever did.

It’s a good shirt though. Comfortable. Sometimes I’d find it neatly tucked away in my shirt drawer and put it on to work around the house or on the car, or when I lounged around on the weekends. Not so much after she started commandeering it as a nightshirt, usually during the cooler months. When she didn’t roll the sleeves up, they hung off her arms past her hands. It’s the only piece of clothing we more or less shared.

From the first time I saw her in my shirt it did something to me. Oh, I joked how it made her look like a hobo or refugee, but the truth had always struck me as incredibly arousing, more so than when she wore lingerie or even nothing at all. It was as if, from all the way across the room, the cloth allowed me a vicarious caressing of the warm, silky flesh beneath.

“Hey sexy lady,” I had said to her then.

“Sexy? In this ratty old thing? Right,” she replied, dismissively, like I must be kidding her, though mischievousness played at the corner of her lips and eyes saying she knew I wasn’t.

Since then, seeing her wear that shirt confirmed all the more that she was mine. Mine enveloped in mine. I know you Dr. Phil types out there are probably claiming possession of someone makes for an unhealthy relationship, but she belonged to me as surely as I to her, for always and forever, exactly as we vowed to one another.

“Dad?” our daughter calls to me, standing amid an obstacle course of cardboard boxes in my bedroom, holding the shirt by its shoulders like an empty plaid pelt.

“Yes, hon?”

“Why is this shirt in with Mom’s stuff? It’s yours right?”

“No, it’s hers.”

It was always hers.

“Keep it or donate it?” she asks, as practical as her mother, even more so since the funeral.

I wave a hand. Indifferent or ambivalent, I cannot say. She tosses it into a box mark “Goodwill.” Sure. Let it live.
