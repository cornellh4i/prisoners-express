Visitation By Kevin Murphy

The morning is nice and cool, like an air conditioned room. The sun is out and the sky is a light blue and there isn’t a cloud to be seen. I’m sitting on one of the benches, in the cage, outside of the building that they call one building. I’m a little anxious, so much so that it is hard for me to stay sitting. I’m waiting to be called in for a visit.

It has been a year and a half since anyone has come to see me. Home is a long way away, a seven hour drive, and it’s hard to make the trip, not to mention, costly. It has been a long time since the trip was made and now here I am waiting to see my family.

There is usually about a thirty minute wait and I’ve been waiting for about that long. Men have come in after me and have been called in and still I wait. I’m trying not to seem anxious. In here you learn to hide your emotions, but my leg won’t stop jumping and I keep biting at my nails.

Finally a guard comes and calls my name and I go into one building. I sign in and then go stand by the door to visitation. After a few minutes I’m let in and I go into the strip-down room and get undressed. This is my least favorite part of the whole visit. It is a very humiliating experience, getting all of my clothes checked and thrown on the floor then showing all of my nooks and crannies to a stranger, or even worse, to a boss I know. Getting dressed has always been a relief to me, I guess that it is because it is over and I can't redignify myself.

I walk out of the strip-down area and I’m told where I will be sitting and what kind of visit I’m having and then I’m let out into the visitation area.

When I step out I look around for my visitors but I don’t see them at the table we’re assigned to. I search the area with my eyes as I head for the front desk to check in and I see her, my mother. She is at one of the vending machines and has a handful of chips and sandwiches. She looks way too thin, and she has aged quite a bit since the last time that I saw her. I can’t take my eyes from her and I can’t swallow the lump in my throat. I step away from the desk and she sees me and she smiles a tear filled smile.

She places the snacks on the table and there is a boss ther telling her that she can’t put them on the table, that she has to go to the searchers table and have them opened in front and one of the other officers. I smile and act like it isn’t a big deal and she sadly walks over and places the items on the other table.

She tries to hurry and I smile as she starts to get upset. I do this so she will see me and calm down some, I hate to see my mother upset and me doing the same won’t help matters.

My Aunt walks up with a few drinks and hurries over to the searchers desk and tells my mother that she’s got it and my mother walks over and we hug. She seems so fragile and I am careful not to squeeze her too hard. My mother has always appeared to be
