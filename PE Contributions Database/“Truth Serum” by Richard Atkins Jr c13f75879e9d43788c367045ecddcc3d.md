**“Truth Serum” by Richard Atkins Jr.**

If the world all told the truth, the world would be a better civilization. The truth is better than a lie. I know. Because I live it like breathing fresh air every day. Sometimes the truth hurts loved ones, family, friends, and strangers. But when we speak the truth, the truth relieves that hurt, that pain.

When we make mistakes, we act like it’s the end of the world! All because of the shame that we feel and the fear of what people may or may not think.

I speak nothing except the truth, 24/7. Doesn’t matter what the subject may be. I talk and socialize a lot, but it’s informative. And some have said I talk too much, But when I think of my bank account versus their bank account, I wonder how bad that can truthfully be. Plus, I am speaking the truth.

People act like the truth doesn’t matter, but deep down they’re familiar with the truth and how it relieves the pain. How it relieves the stress on our shoulders and how it ends all debate.

The truth is more powerful than an assault weapon in America.

I trust the truth. I believe in the truth, and I love the truth the way I love my family.

They say the truth shall set you free! That’s why, when you tell your woman the truth about your unfaithful ways, she at times forgives you. But when you lie, you die. When you lie, you die mentally and neither she nor anyone else is willing to forgive you.

Speak the truth and the truth will make everyone who really knows you, love you. Everyone who really loves you, love you a lot more!

This is my truth serum.
