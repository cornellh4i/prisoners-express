**“Flying” by Terry Lytle**

Bryan Lee Blades—“B.B”—is a friend of mine. He’s a little older than me, but not by much. He went to Iraq, “Desert Storm,” in 1991; I had charges in three counties in North Carolina. I was facing life, he was too. Everyday! I was 16; he couldn’t buy a beer. To get out of Iraq, alive…

I met him years ago: I went home after an almost five year bid. He was doing around 18 rounds for a second degree murder… a sad situation… man oh man… domestic. “Wifey” and kids—her, Matthew, and Erica. An Iraqi war-veteran doing over 20 all together… earlier situation… a similar incident… domestic… not “wifey,” but “wifey” just the same.

Decorated, too! Honorable discharge—medals and all. One of them stars! He blew up. His life on the line for others! Did I say he was adopted? Way out in California… I’m from Arizona. Doing 25½ now. When I do see the stars, I wonder which one is him… ‘cause I **know** he’s alive.

*“At The Price of Wings—Divorce”*

I’m gonna fly, like the unbidden terror that you fear

I’m gonna fly, like the black ocean of my soul… with its

depthless waves

its

crashing and rage… its salty… tears… As windbreakers cascade into the waves of light upon

the white sands

I’m gonna fly, while I… tear away the skin of

imprisoning man…

Fossilize it, like all the things before me—and whatever else…

that may be beneath the… bloody hands

That I cleanse… as I levitate into the “newness” of

flight

Like an angel… or unseen demon, into the new blackness

of night…

I’m gonna fly, like a hurricane whiskin’ through seashells…

destroying coral reefs…

Beneath the midnight-blue clouds, I’m gonna fly…

into the darkness that you’ve left behind

Where there’s nothing to see… nothing to hear… nothing to say…

For the words have all been spoken…

Through the silent rage that’s so loud… that its

presence is like turbulence that I run to…

just trying to see you again somehow…

Because I…

am not confused: ‘tis I, beneath the

starry sky…

Breathless…

as I fly…

Between the secrets of two planes, as your soul

sheds a body…

only to be hindered… and imprisoned in

some type of—

Purgatory-like hell… while its female half

maintains its fear… of closure

For one soul is equal halves: male, female… and the

dominance of a world so cold

upon

its

female...

half...

Is so utterly frustrating… that he….

Flies…

Like the

blindingly blue black swirls that unfurl…

The child curls… like angel wings in top speed

flight...

While a mother shows a daughter a… solo…

Shooting star… of light… tonight…

Which is nothing less than alpha male…

As he flies…

below the astral plane, just enough…

To wonder why…

the rest of humanity… would trade…

Body…

at the price of wings…

(And then)

The last time I saw Bryan… he gave me coffee because I was asking him to come to the N.A. meeting with me… We talked some… He let me know where he was at…

And he died that night, while I was at the N.A. meeting… dropped dead in the shower… he didn’t know that “monster” out there? He was real....

Maybe I’ll tell you about him…

I dedicate this ALL to Bryan Lee Blades—”Bro, I miss you!”
