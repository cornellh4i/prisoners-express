**Accomplishments By Daniel Montano**

Accomplishments, when one puts their thoughts to this word we begin to think of a list of our accomplishments, such as awards accumulated over the years, graduations, diplomas, degrees, job and career promotions etc.. I looked up the work, accomplishments; in the dictionary and it’s likeness the word, “triumph,” jumped out at me. I believe our greatest triumphs, our greatest accomplishments come from the relations we harvest in this life.

For example, a father can be a great provider, he can provide a home for his children, put clothes on their backs, make sure there’s enough food in the house. However these things alone will never define him as a good father. To be a truly good father he would need to have a good healthy relationship with his kids. Being a good provider does not raise good healthy children. When one as a father, has a good, respectful, trusting relationship with his kids. The children go out into the world with a higher confidence and no doubt better equipped to deal with the world outside their home, and when that confidence falters there will be no hesitation to seek their father’s support. That to me is when one can claim the accomplishment, triumph of being a father.

This example I believe transcends to many if not all aspects of life. One can be a politician climbing that political latter, in this world at its present, it can get you to the top. History will eventually be the ultimate judge and one will truly be remembered over the years through the relationships formed and how many lives were touched through tem relationships and lives changed in the most positive way. For that politician, without this, anyone's accomplishment would only be down on paper and no doubt quickly forgotten.

Not to take from these accomplishments previously mentioned of job career promotions, success in sports etc., it definitely takes hand work which should be commended. However those achievements at one point, one way or another, become hollow if they are not filled by the positive relationships formed, the lives touched, the difference one made in people's lives during those journeys. This fills those achievements with great substance, thus making them the greatest accomplishments possible on a personal level and in a world level.

This is where I feel our greatest accomplishments come from, our relationships with others, how through them we make the next person, better. At least this is what I want to believe, for it gives me the hope that no matter my circumstances, no matter the loss of my physical freedom, my greatest accomplishments are always possible and certainly within my grasp.
