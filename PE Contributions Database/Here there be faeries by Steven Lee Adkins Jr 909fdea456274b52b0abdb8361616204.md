**Here there be faeries by Steven Lee Adkins Jr.**

Halt!

Look there. There, just beyond the clearing.

Shhhh. Keep it down, don’t frighten her away. A child? No. We may never see another the rest of our days but if she were to lead you somehow, into the fields, it could be the last any of us ever sees.

That, good friend, is a faerie.

Yes, I’m serious. That seeming to be a human child could be hundreds of years old or hundreds of thousand of years old. Living a wildlife of mirth in the wildflowers and the breeze.

No my friend! Come back. Bah! Let's try to catch him. And look… she’s laughing waving him on. There’s more of them. Ha! I had no idea my good friend could dance so. And look at me, I’ve never danced in my life but now you’d think I was born to it. So happy dancing with us in circles, peeling with laughter. I wonder, is such fun always to be had in these fields? I’m winded, hope we rest soon.
