**“Buried Alive” by Ignacio Carillo**

What a beautiful view, I thought. From way up here the fall would surely kill me. The coward’s solution, I know, but you can only fall so deep into the well before being consumed by the darkness.

I hated myself for being so weak. I could barely stand my own reflection. Maybe I deserved it? Punishment for weak women who can’t say no.

No one would believe me. Everyone loves him -- he’s Mr. Perfect. They’ll say I was drunk -- and I was. That I chose to go to his place -- and I did. That I wanted it -- but I didn’t.

I wonder where he is? Lurking in some shadow waiting to mock me with his greasy smile. Does he care about what he’s taken from me? Does he even know?

I can’t leave my mausoleum -- delegated to watching life from my perch high above the city. Am I buried yet undead or am I dead yet unburied?
