**"Mc D. vs. B.K" by Curtis Colvin** 

I wasnâ€™t much of a "breakfast" man until I came out of the navy and got married. Then I, or my wife, would wake up early and cook, to surprise the other. Then we got lazy. She's the one who turned me on to croissants. The first bacon, egg, and cheese croissant I ate from Burger King hooked me. I was a goner! We tried all kinds of taquitos, breakfast burritos, biscuits, breakfast sandwiches. We came to the unanimous conclusion that Burger King's breakfast beat Micky D's any ole day. This was all back in the mid-'80s before everyone added breakfast to their menu's.

We would even take McDonald's coupons for "Buy a Biscuit, Get One Free" to Burger King. For they would honor any competitor's coupons. I got so hooked, I would leave earlier when I went to work, just to stop at Burger King and grab a sausage, egg, and cheese croissant (with hash browns of course).

It's been close to 20 years since I've ate one. I can't wait to get out and try some of the new hems from all the other places that now sells breakfast. But, I betcha that I will keep coming back to Burger King, not McDonald's!
