**“Ghazal (Apologies)” by Chad Frank**

People are always demanding apologies,

but what good is an apology?

Does simply saying “Sorry”

count as an apology?

If an apology lacks sincerity,

is it still considered an apology?

How many times can somebody apologize

for the same wrong-doing before it becomes an empty apology?

If someone harms intentionally,

the harm can’t be erased with a mere apology.

Chad, when making a list of people with whom to apologize,

start by giving yourself an apology.
