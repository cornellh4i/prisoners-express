**“Really” by Jack Simpson**

Our plans included sightseeing and a walk in the park. Leaving George a day early would allow time for all of this. We wanted to surprise Mark and Linda in New York. George and I had been dating for a couple of years.

“Look, George, how beautiful Central Park is this time of year.” I couldn’t believe this was still here in the city. Park benches aligned the walking path. An elderly couple sat on the bench we were heading for. 

“Can we join the both of you?” Laura asked.

“I do detect a Southern drawl from you, my dear. Please join Martha and I. First time in New York?” he stated. George answered quickly and added that they were here to see friends.

“Don’t tell me, let me guess where you’re both from,” the old man said.

“Now, Bob, leave the young couple alone,” Martha went on to say while patting his hand, “they have better things to do than being bothered by an old couple like us.”

“Martha,” he said with a little gasp in his voice, “I just like to meet people.”

“It’s alright ma’am. It would be nice to see if he can.”

“See, Martha, they don’t mind,” Bob cut in while smiling and showing his yellowing teeth.

“I do believe that you could be from Alabama. Since I have traveled around all states and foreign countries prior to my retirement…”

George wanted to cut in and was about to speak when Bob threw up his hand to stop him. Bob couldn’t contain himself any longer. “Let’s just say I would love to have a Georgia peach.”

“No way,” Lauren laughed. George could hardly contain himself. They both were amazed at how he did it so quick at his age. What they didn’t know was that Bob was in a special branch of service, where he used his skills to capture some of the worst people in the world.

“I hope my mind is bright like yours when I’m your age.”

Bob stated that all it took was a loving woman and a lot of faith to make it work. Most of all don’t give up on your dreams! The two couples talked for hours and then parted their ways. George was talking about how the two must have been together forever. Laura agreed and was now feeling hunger pains.

“Mark and Linda’s apartment is only three blocks away. We can walk and enjoy the sights and fresh air,” Laura suggested to George, “Money would be tight plus tax; it would be of no use.” Eating out in a restaurant didn’t sound too appealing.

A voice rang out near the corner. It caught both of them and the aroma filled the air. They then said it at the same time. “Hot Dogs!” All was going well until George asked for mayo. The man looked at him with disappointment. The stand only had mustard, so they paid and walked off. The vendor was still talking. George couldn’t make out what he was saying, but this he knew wasn’t English. He thought he detected a few swear words. He wasn’t sure and wasn’t going back to ask.

George noticed the women comping up the sidewalk. His mind went blank. Her figure is one that most women would die for. All thoughts disappeared. Laura was still holding his hand when all of a sudden a long whistle came out. This sound not only stopped her in their tracks but also the women smiled as they walked away. The comment brought George back to where he needed to be.

“Really, really, George. He knew that trying to smooth things over wasn’t going to work.”

When he turned, it was worse than he had figured; that look would take down a runaway train. Nothing was going to connect his own selfish mistakes. Her face had one stern look, her cheeks blood red. It was her stance that told the rest.

She let go of his hand and walked on ahead to Linda’s apartment. He started to walk toward her. By now, she was a good fifty feet ahead of him. Soon she would be lost in the crowd. The only place she could go was their friends’ place. He too, knew where it was.

He was very tired once the elevator has stopped on the seventh floor. He stepped out and walked up to the door and rang the buzzer. It opened to reveal Mark. Before George could say a word, Mark said, “Really! Dude, what were you thinking? You could have lost the only woman who loves you.”

Once they talked and he told Laura he was sorry for his actions, the two worked it all out and enjoyed their time in New York. This is an example to life and how it is that most people want their cake and want to eat it. I say that just like the song goes, “If you can’t love the one you want, love the one you are with.” Life is too short to ruin a perfect relationship.
