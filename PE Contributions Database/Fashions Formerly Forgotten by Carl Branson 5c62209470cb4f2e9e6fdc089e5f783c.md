**Fashions Formerly Forgotten by Carl Branson**

Having never been a GQ or fashionista kind of guy, my recounting of fashion fads during the threescore-and-ten years of my life cannot be viewed as reliable or authoritative. Also, having spent my "formative years" (birth through age 18) in a solid WARE (White Anglo Roman Catholic) neighborhood, my choices were influenced by the environmental attitude of formal attire.

Parochial elementary school with its regimental uniform of navy blue pants, white shirt, and blue tie for boys with white blouse and blue/white plaid jumper or skirt for girls were the daily fare 5 days a week. After school and Saturdays were spent primarily in jeans and seasonally appropriate shirts. Sundays in the 1950s WARE neighborhood demanded formal wear for church attendance and visiting friends or relatives. Formal wear included bowlers or fedoras for men/boys and a variety of decorative hats for women to accent their classy dresses (watch movies about that era to see period attire).

1964 was a turning point in my fashion awareness. Well, sort of anyhow. Transitioning from a parochial elementary school to a public high school was a bit of a culture shock. Granted, most of the girls still wore dresses or skirts but, wow, they were a whole lot more complimentary than the plaid A-line skirts I had viewed for 8 years. Guys had a rather eclectic collection varying from the dress slacks and shirts, jeans and t-shirts, to surplus military fatigues. Then the Beatles "crossed the pond" appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show with their long hair and Seville Row duds.

That old platitude about mimicry being the best form of flattery had its heyday for male teen clothing choices. It was round about that same time that the mini skirt was coming into vogue (we won't talk about the drooling males). Clothing combinations became rather outrageous when you consider that it was acceptable to wear striped bell bottoms with checkered or paisley shirts. Then you had to add the garb of Vietnam War protesters, the free love/flower power hippies, and Woodstock festival attendees to realize there really was no typical attire; it was definitely an era of "anything goes."

By 1972 I dropped out of college, had a great job in high-tech, and had purchased my first house. I was now a member of the "professional establishment" and as such it was back into the regimental dress pants, shirt, and tie with sports coat optional but recommended. I was aware of the arrival of John Travolta, the Disco craze, and leisure suits, but didn't participate in that fad.

In 1981 my employer moved me and its research and development headquarters to the desert southwest where the Western/Cowboy look was standard fare. Now, because "dress code" even in the professional setting had relaxed significantly, I was in hog-heaven! From the time I was introduced to square dancing while in 8th grade I had an affinity for western wear with its pearl button shirts, bolo ties, dress jeans, and boots. In turn, I had no interest in what the rest of male society was wearing.

I would not be writing an essay in response to a Prisoner Express prompt if things did not change drastically 21 years ago. For this tenure I have been wearing this orange uniform that rapidly sun bleaches to a pale peach. The only garments that are not orange are the socks and boxers. This is one fashion trend I will not forget no matter how hard I try.
