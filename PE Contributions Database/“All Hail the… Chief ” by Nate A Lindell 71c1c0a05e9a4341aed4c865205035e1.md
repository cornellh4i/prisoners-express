**“All Hail the… Chief?” by Nate A. Lindell**

If the two main nominees for the 2016 Presidential Election didn’t make you feel old and wrinkled and want to cover your face in dismay, you must be Vladimir Putin. On one hand, we had someone who’s supposed to be a Liberal and for the working people, yet her husband (“the first Black President”) signed laws (i.e. the Prison Litigation Reform Act and the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act) and made trade deals that have denied thousands of prisoners (mostly black) relief from inhumane prison conditions, illegal convictions, and hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs, and she lied to us about her emails. Then there was the Great Pumpkin, who kept his foot in his mouth during the entire campaign, going so far as to urge Russia to spy on his opponent and publish the results, which turned my hair gray and made it stand in amazement.

By the time this is published, one or the other of these neo-Libernazis/Con-Artists will be, *gulp*, our President and tell us lies while either wolfishly grinning or belligerently frowning, leaving Americans in wide-eyed despair of ever having an honest, competent, caring, and sane Commander in Chief.

I pray this prophecy is wrong and that the Green Party’s candidate, by some miracle, is voted in.
