**Untouched Truth by Anonymous**

The cold blades of grass touched the sides of my bare feet on the edges of my Tera sandals. Palms of my hands still moist from nervous sweat. Two-fold reasons of trigger and a sense of being watched. Though I was yet to see her. Thoughts of some recent sex scandal gossip. I push it to the back of my mind. Fleshly concerns as I sense this entity. I stand alone in the night air that’s damp enough so mosquitoes wouldn’t come out in spite of the warmth. “Yo, yo, grrr, yo,” the frogs continued. I descended the hill with the pipe in hand. I spun the bic lighter’s wheel. The fuel source locked from the child proof feature. The breeze of the day gone and still. I learned as I walked. Every step like slicing the pie. More and more details. I get brave and sit on an upside down 5-gallon bucket. Near a mulberry tree my feet rest on the grassless topsoil. Three, two, one, launch. Such a lingering taste of chlorophyll and a hint of alcohol. Should’ve used a petroleum distillate or ethyl alcohol, I mused as the rising grasp came. Plant based DMT. The face of a girl, the body of a woman in a Celtic funeral garb circa 1500 or so. Kissing me on the forehead she spoke cryptic advice I’d only be able to evaluate properly upon sobriety. Legs welded to the soil, I was paralyzed in intoxicated wonder. I still remember her parting words. “Grow more, grow again.”
