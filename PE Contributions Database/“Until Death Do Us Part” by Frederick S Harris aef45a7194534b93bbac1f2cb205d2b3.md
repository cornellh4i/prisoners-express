**“Until Death Do Us Part” by Frederick S. Harris**

****Like many men and women locked away in the American penological system, I got married to this bitch named “tha game” when I was young and naive. “Until death do us part” was my motto. That was how I carried it with that bitch (no reference to the female species).

We wed; not by choice, but by force. The wedding had been arranged through a process of psychological conditioning that was orchestrated by a powerful entity widely known as “the system,” which I’ll try to explain a little more later in this treatise.

Right now I want to tell you about my ex-bitch, “tha game” (i.e., a culture and/or way of life). You see, if I would have known then what I know now, I never would have said “I do.” Because that bitch was nothing but trouble. Real bad news, I tell you.

From the start of our relationship we had problems. I should have seen the “red flags” when the bitch wanted me to choose between running the streets or going to school. The bitch was so alluring that I defied all the directions, warnings, and advice that every older and wiser person (including my own mother) tried to give me, and I chose the streets over school ( a bad move to say the least).

I used to try to rationalize my behavior by telling myself “I was young, and high all the time.” Then I remembered that that bitch was the one who seduced me and introduced me to drugs. Those were that bitch’s friends, not mine. I never knew them until I met “tha game”.

I also look around. There are many, many young guys behind these walls who dated “tha game” and never got high. Never even smoked a joint. Yet, they’re in the same exact predicament as I am. So I can’t blame my poor choice on my youth or on getting high- although they surely didn’t help matters at all. Now, the next red flag that should have told me that bitch wasn’t right for me was that the bitch wanted me to to have “power” and “money.” (I was only twelve years old). But, I was so captivated by the bitch that I joined a gang, started selling drugs and played around with weapons to carry out violence against anyone who challenged me. Whether it was a rock, a brick, a stick, bat, a knife or a gun. Whatever it took, I used it.

Through my displays of violence, willingness to fight and to do anything I had to do to survive, I gained a reputation (among my peers). I was considered “thorough,” “real,” “a stand up ni##a,” “a rider,” and “one of the Lords.” Although, looking back, that really wasn't such a good thing. Because eventually, I got put on the police’s radar. Once you get on the police’s radar, you are guaranteed to see the inside of a jail cell sooner or later.

Besides, having a reputation like that couldn’t get me far in life anyway. Unless I chose to limit myself. Because in reality, gang members are a minority inside of a minority. So their social, political and economical power is superficial, almost non-existent.

That is not to say that gang members have no potential, or that gangs in general have no influence. They do. Just not on a scale large enough to have any real, substantial impact on the social, political and economic issues that actually affect us the most. Because they exist, not as one, but as too many different fractions.

Nevertheless, I stayed faithful to “tha game”. Yet, even though I sold drugs, I stayed broke. Because I had no real concept of “economies.” Remember, technically I dropped out of standardized school at the age of twelve. That’s why I had no real substantial concept of finance.

Sure, I knew money could buy “things.” But I didn’t really comprehend the value of money. Not until I was well into my thirties. So, just like many young and naive people, I wasted my money on a host of insignificant “things.” Too many to list them all here. But, you get the picture.

Now, don’t get me wrong, me and “tha game” had a lot of good times together. She introduced me to a lot of good people and we had many great, fun and exciting experiences. I wouldn’t be the man I am today had it not been for “tha game”. And I do appreciate that, and I cherish that (gunshot wounds and all).

But, at the same time, I’ve come to realize that “tha game” is what had been holding me back all this time. You see, the only times in my life that I ever really sat down to learn and educate myself about the world were when I was incarcerated. However, I never really did any amount of real significant time (before this time), so my educational experiences had been sporadic. That’s because every time I got out of jail or prison, I was right back to running the streets. Right back to “tha game” and the same ole things, drugs, guns and violence. It became a cycle. I was running in place.

Then came the pivotal point in my life where the state had given me enough time to really sit down and to study to educate myself. I started reading a lot (just as Malcolm X did). I devoured every book I got my hands on. I didn’t discriminate. I had to study the law, so I used to read dozens of case laws everyday. Then I started writing legal briefs, petitions, etc. Eventually I became proficient in both criminal and civil rights law.

Simultaneously, I studied other subjects such as history, philosophy, Psychology/Social psychology, political science, and business. I also would read autobiographies and biographies written by and about successful people. I read self-help and motivational books. I even studied the concepts of several religions including Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and even scientology and satanism.

But all the wisdom, knowledge and understanding I’ve acquired has been beneficial and/or conducive to my future success. The study of slavery and the development of America from different perspectives than the perspectives of those caucasians that contributed to the American history textbooks I was told to read in school had the most profound effect on me and my contemporary point of view. Compounded by my growing knowledge of psychology/social psychology and politics, I came to understand how “the system,” which has become a self-sustaining institution for the oppression and exploitation of all “minorities” (whether white, black, hispanic, or Asian) that had been developed by the so-called founding fathers of this country psychologically conditions many young men and women to believe they’re “powerless” so they will submerge into subterranean cultures (i.e. tha game).

The so-called “powerless” cling to guns, drugs and other forms of criminality as their only source of “power” because they/we do not realize we have “options.” That’s why jails, juvenile detention centers and prisons all across this country are up and running at full capacity. Because we’re psychologically conditioned by “the system” (in many different ways) to feel “powerless.” In psychology it’s called “behaviorism” or “behavior modification.”

But, boy oh boy, can you imagine the day when the so-called “powerless” wake up from the “American Dream” and realize just how powerful we really are? It can happen. It will happen one day. I woke up…

What happened to my marriage to “tha game”, you ask? Well, like I said, “until death do us part.” To me, that bitch is so dead.
