**Modupe! (Thank You!)**

There’s so much I’m thankful for, despite my level two captivity at “Shane Jackson's'' plantation. This highly hepatitis infected graveyard sits on bayer road in Carson city. Minus the several past and current attempts if genocide, I remain thankful. One of many things I’m thankful for is the forgotten wisdom of nature received from the creator through decelerated vibrations identified as Baba, Kibwe, Grandman, Atiba, Asejafu, Nosikinee, Mangaaka, Modibo, Chika, Sebek, Atiba Bomani and the list goes on. I’m thankful for this wisdom which helped and helps me navigate the ajogun forces of the world. I recalled so much about the universe within my being as well as the extended aspects of myself. This recollection of forgotten wisdom allows me to see reality with my “Iwaju'' instead of illusions with my eyes. I’m thankful for being able to see the world differently at thirty four years old then I did at fourteen years of age. Modupe!!!

Modupe! Olorun, Modupe Baba’s and Warrior priest.
