****Everyday I wake up and go through the halls of this prison. I’m watching, fully aware. Some say I’m paranoid, but I call it being cautious. Four years ago, I got 8-10 years for killing a friend by stabbing him. I believe in karma, and I know what goes around comes around.

My biggest fear, as I get closer to my release date, is that someone will stab me or that I’ll get into another fight where I’ll stab someone and get more time. My biggest fear is I won’t make it out the other side of this concrete jungle. People take their freedom for granted. I’ve watched so many people end up dead before they ever got a chance to go home. These are people who had dreams and plans for the free world who will never see it again… Ever! Or people who came in with 8 years and added a life sentence because somebody else had a bad day!

I’ve come so far in my growth for change that it truly scares me not to be able to apply myself and the changes I’ve made one more time in the free world. Some call me paranoid, some call me crazy, but I call it being aware. Sometimes fear is your greatest tool for survival. A scared man is fast on his feet for fight, flight, or foreseeing future problems. Everyday I look fear in the face!
