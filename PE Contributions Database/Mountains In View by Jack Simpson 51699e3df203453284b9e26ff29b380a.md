**Mountains In View by Jack Simpson**

I had worked all my life just to get up one morning and found myself retired. I grew up around beaches and lived there all my life. It had soon lost all of its luster to me. I needed more.

Being a lifeguard isn’t an easy life. Everyone depends on me for safety. Getting old isn’t funny when you really love to do something. I felt alive sitting in that chair. Looking at a view that soon would be no more than a memory.

My body had told me after all the tears of torture in the sun and all the running. I had to change in order to make it. Now I patrol the beaches handing out tickets I had no desire to do. Not everyone is here to break the law.

I had decided to sell my beach house and travel. The realtor said it would sell easily since it has an ocean view and a split level. Less than two weeks it was sold. Money in my account and traveler checks in my pockets.

The day I left, I told myself I wouldn’t look back. My heart sank a little as I drove away. Fort Lauderdale bound for a lifeguard convention. Talk about Bikinis and old swim trunks. Some of them would leave a lasting impression. One that I hope would soon leave my memory banks.

My three day trip after the convention was well on the way. Since I had never left Florida, mountains would be a beautiful sight for me. My heart was set on seeing the Colorado Rockies.

The late John Denver had a way to express his feelings in songs. My heart was to sit on the rocks where he had sat and run my fingers over the words of his song. I had never seen an Eagle fly. Only on Nature shows at ETV. This really had been one of my dreams.

Time has a way of losing you as the miles clicked by. Seemed just like last night I was in Florida. Now the traveling was coming to an end. I could look ahead and see rows of beautiful mountains in the fading sunlight.

Clouds appeared through the broken sky and on the right the moon appeared in it’s quarter phase. My heart beat with pure excitement. Soon I would be listening and reading the words of the “Rocky Mountain High” song.

The mountain that he sang about had special meaning to me. I wanted to close my eyes and just float away. Just a few more miles and I could do just that.

Pulling in the parking lot, I grabbed my disk player and adjusted the headphones. My legs were shaking with excitement. When I stopped, my feet touched the same rock that Mr. Denver had sat on. I pushed play and the music sent me back to that time. With my eyes closed, I could float away on Eagle wings. Each word was crystal clear. Tears welled up in my eyes. All my life I had listened to his music and it made me feel like I was part of his life.

I heard a voice say, “Are you alright sir?”. My eyes opened to see a park ranger and I explained that I had driven from Florida to see this wonderful sight. That I had wanted to see these mountains all my life.

We talked about Mr. Denver’s life and how it was so thoughtful that people still cared for his music. I told him I was the one who felt honored. He helped to change my life completely. That enjoying the rest of my retirement would be easy.

The love of beaches to mountains, nothing beats a great tune, a beautiful view, and most of all, the feeling of being free. To seal it all, an Eagle flew over head and called out.
