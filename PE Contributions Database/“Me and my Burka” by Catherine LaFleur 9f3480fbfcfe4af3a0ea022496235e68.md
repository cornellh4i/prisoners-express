**“Me and my Burka”** by Catherine LaFleur

While I was away with the Fairies, otherwise known as my vacation at Larkin Hospital, the administration decided to recall all the dresses at Camp Prisoney Land. This is because many of the garments are, to put it lightly, indecent. Oh they started out modest enough, just a plain house dress with five buttons and a pocket, but with all the alterations the women made over the years, they soon became rather daring. Many of the dresses were… uhm... Closely fitted and very short.

The dresses I had were inherited from my previous roommate, who rather resembled the Willendorf Venus, a big legged woman, in all respects. When she went home, I got the dresses. Big, blue, and roomy, they hung on me like an all enveloping burka. Just my head and arms below the elbow sticking out. They were also long and gave the impression I wasn’t walking, just sort of levitating along. Those dresses made my body look like Area 51- you know it’s there, but nothing is visible.

The Administration also took the dress I went to the hospital in, leaving me without clothes except for the double hospital gown. I kind of wondered how they were expecting to take me back to the prison. Obviously, not naked, right? Enter the pants. They forced me into pants. Now, I grew up in a fundamentalist religious cult, and I haven’t worn pants since I was a little kid.
Of course, I was traumatized, but doubly so, the said pants contained a crotch that hit me at the knee, an extremely long waist, and tiny little legs. I know where Tyrion Lannister’s pants are. They are alive and well and being manufactured at Camp Prisoney Land. They also had a large patch on the butt as if something had exploded outward from there. In short, they were circus pants. Oh, the sting of poor fashion choices!

I briefly considered staying in the hospital, where they had been feeding me chicken dinners, salads with Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing, and fresh fruit, not to mention watching HBO shows and movies all day and night. There was no choice. I had to wear the pants.
Fortunately, I got back to the prison at night, so there was no one around to view me wearing the clown pants. That is, except for certain staff members in the Special Housing Unit, the place where I work. When you come to the prison after working hours, the SHU is where they stash you until the next day.. They did so enjoy teasing me. One sergeant said, “You look mighty cute in them dungarees, missy”. Har-de-har-har. Such comedians they are.

The next day another sergeant told me the pants were just wrong on me. Oh thank you, thank you! I'll take validation where I can find it. She gave me a light green SHU dress to wear to the laundry. I was on my way there. Little did I know what awaited me.

The laundry officer informed me that my dresses were not in storage, that there was a new spring fashion line and I was going to be one of the first lucky recipients. I was expecting a redux of my former dresses. I was disappointed. I put it on. Well, not exactly. I had to squirm into it. They presented me with an allegedly one-size-fits-all tube. Now, I am not a thin person, but also not fat. I do possess breasts, belly, butt, and thights. However, this dress was built to accommodate starving people living in developing world countries.

Holding my breath and giving the laundry officer my narrow blue-eyed gaze, I say, “Are you sure you want me to wear this?” as I look at myself in the mirror. “What’s the problem?” the officer asked, looking me over in a bored manner. I stared at myself in the mirror. “Well, I’m not a snake. How am I supposed to walk in this thing?” I asked. She looked me up and down again and replied, “Guess you’ll have to figure that out.''

Now I wear dresses because I like to dress modestly and I have a religious dress pass to accommodate this. As I walked back to the dorm, all was not well in LaFleur Land. For one thing, everything on my body that was accustomed to a wide range of free movement was now heavily constrained and… gasp... Wriggling.

The dress was singing chicky-wow-chicky-wow-chicky-wow-wow-wow, sort of like the soundtrack to a 70s porn flick. That is when the wolf whistle came out of nowhere. One of my thuggy clients from the law library had caught sight of me and decided to let loose. Another old woman serenaded me with the song Love for Sale. How is it that these people were so funny before, but now so much now?

After a day of shallow breathing and more ribald comments from my fellow inmates I decided to finish this once and for all. The next morning, I went to the lecherous senior official. He could see me coming from a mile away five pounds of sausage in a three pound casing, strutting down the compound. All the body parts were fighting for space like pigs fighting under a blanket.
After looking me up and down twice, he said, “You’ve got a problem”. Then, he sent me back to the laundry, where they proceeded to issue me four dresses of the older variety. Turns out the dresses had not been thrown away. Instead, they had been cut down the center and repurposed as night robes.

Thankfully, all is well in Camp Prisoney Land. I can breathe again and nothing is singing chicky-wow-chicky-wow-chicky-wow-wow-wow.
