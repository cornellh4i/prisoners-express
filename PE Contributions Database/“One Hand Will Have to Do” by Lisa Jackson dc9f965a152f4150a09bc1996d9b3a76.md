**“One Hand Will Have to Do” by Lisa Jackson**

My wife sat on our couch with her cozy winter sweater on and my head in her lap. It was our mid-week routine to shut off all electronics and reconnect with each other on a human level.

That’s when she hit me with the news: she wanted a baby. Stunned into silence and barely comprehending, I nearly missed her explanation. She was lonely, the house needed some young blood, some noise, she’d already picked one out. Wait, wasn’t I supposed to be part of the process, to be present to help with half of the DNA? Besides, we agreed before the wedding we didn’t want kids, ever.

“It’s not what you think,” she was saying with a grin. Reaching for her laptop, she squeezed my face into her abdomen, laughing at my discomfort (physical and emotional). A string of keystrokes led to the website of our local animal shelter. A small, frightened puppy of a multi-colored coat sat cowering in a cage, eyes imploring release.

And so we became a family of three. We named our “baby” Dolby, for when he barked it sounded like stereo surround sound. The only quiet time we have now is that same Wednesday ritual on the couch. Difference being Dolby is spanned across my wife’s lap, in doggie heaven as she scratches his belly, eyes closed in relaxed ecstasy. All I can reach for is the only part of her not engrossed in Dolby. One hand will have to do.
