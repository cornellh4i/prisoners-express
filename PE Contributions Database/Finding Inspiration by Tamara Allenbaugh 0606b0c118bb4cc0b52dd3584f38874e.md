**Finding Inspiration by Tamara Allenbaugh**

Who would’ve thought I would find inspiration in the oppressive environment of solitary confinement? By changing my perception, I’ve been able to find inspiration in the most mundane of things. Please allow me to share my inspirations with you.

1) Hate and animosity – I’m experiencing a lot of hate and animosity in my present circumstances. I’ve become the object of hate and negativity. But I don’t hate back. Each and every unkind and hurtful word inspires me to treat others with respect and dignity. Grudges wound the soul with mortal wounds and enslaves the grudge holder. For each unkind word, I turn it into something positive. For each unkind word spoken to me, I’ve decided to perform one act of kindness or say one uplifting thing to another who is hurting.

2) I’ve noticed lowly house-flies flying around my cell all day, making attempt after attempt to exit my cell through the tiny cracks in the side of my cell door. I share in this fly’s pain. The fly is relentless in getting its freedom, and refuses to give up. It inspires me to keep on pressing and not giving up in my darkest hours. This fly is aware of the possibilities that live beyond the cell, and there’s no reason why I can’t do the same.

You see, inspiration can and often does come from the most ordinary of experiences and things. We just have to be open to the inspiration in any way it may come. May you be inspired today!
