**“My Parents” by Raymond Springs**

Both my parents are the products of the Jim Crow South. My father was born in Corpus Christi and my mother in Little Rock, both to parents one generation removed from slavery in one way or another.

My father is fair-skinned as his mother, and her mother. They all have bone-straight hair and upon moving to Texas was expected as Jewish, which allowed them the same privileges as Whites in the early 1900s. They were very poor and shared crops on my father’s father’s land. These were dark-skinned people who moved to America post-slavery, with money from Ethiopia, I am Sephardic Hebrew Israelite. My paternal grandfather’s father had two wives who were American Aborigines/Indians and sisters of one another. He practiced “patriarchal marriage” as do all right-ruling Israelites. My grand patriarch married my paternal grand matriarch. My father is the second of their offspring, with his older sibling 12 years his senior, he is the last official child of this union, though every family has rumors and secrets.

My father was brought out west as a child with his mother visiting her sister who had married a dark-skinned man. A trip that changed his life and future forever because my grandma met, and fell in love, with another man who had just gotten out of the military. She got pregnant and never returned home. She divorced and remarried, making my father a step child. At the time, his only sibling was in the navy.

My father was mistreated, beaten, and abused physically and verbally, leading to a deep emotional disengagement that affected him as a person. He got into lots of trouble, was committed to Youth Authorities, went to prison, and is a womanizer to this day. Divorced twice from two very beautiful, strong, dark-skinned women, he is now living in Ethiopia, reconnecting with his relatives who never left the continent of Mother Africa.

My mom’s mother, or maternal grand matriarch, had my mother at 13 with a man almost 3 times her age. Her (my mom’s mom) had many brothers and two sisters. They were all cotton pickers who had to work to survive, which made education impossible. She had seven children of her own, everyone is dark-skinned on my mother’s side thank god because it’s where I was provided my own heavenly hue. These wonderful people are the embodiment of family love. Poor in wealth, with very good work ethics, they are determined, simple, and can’t be stopped. They came west while my mother and her brother were alive, though very young. She too is a stepchild to a stepfather who was abusive in many ways. She went to school, raised siblings, worked jobs from 14 years of age even until this day non-stop. She was and is a member of the Black Panther Party. She was an African Dance Troupe member in the late 60s, traveling the country with “The Last Poets.” She bore 4 children, myself being the youngest and her only son. She was married to my father, who was a stepfather to my two oldest sisters. I share both parents with only one of my siblings. My father has many other children, but he was around us until I was a teen and divorce set upon my first household.

My original mother is Auset, Goddess mother of all living, and my father is Ausar, God of the universe, and I am God as I was originally known and am now forever known in the culture I-God. My true and living name is Knowledge Born God Eternal and I am Master over this cipher of love… I know who and what I am!
