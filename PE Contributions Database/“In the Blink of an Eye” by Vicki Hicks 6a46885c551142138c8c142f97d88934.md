**“In the Blink of an Eye” by Vicki Hicks**

In the back of a police cruiser they replaced my badge with silver bracelets, not Tiffany & Co., double hinged and locked.

Left my mahogany desk for four off white walls with bars that clink closed, this is my new address. My Old Navy and Sperry’s are replaced with a pumpkin orange uniform with matching slides and some “Victoria brown” panties. Goodbye to my sleep number bed, hello to a heavy, lumpy mattress. Goodbye to egyptian linens and duvet cover, hello to two threadbare sheets and one scratchy wool blanket. Goodbye to my silk nighty, hello to used white pajamas.

Exiting the transport van, ten foot chain link crowned with razor wire encapsulates me. A guard screams “Remove everything, now squat and cough; No! Cough harder! I want to be able to see real good”. After the frigid shower, blue and white become the new orange. Now in captivity for twelve years surrounded by hundreds masked in the same disguise. I take daily walks not to the park, but to chow, canteen and work. Walking inside the brightly painted yellow lines, I am catatonic, same routine day in and day out. In the blink of an eye.
