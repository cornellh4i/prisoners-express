**Running by Reginald Singletary Jr.**

Running, Run’n, Runnin…

Still attached to the cord running through with my head,

Running through my please waiting to be fed,

A sugar lite rush of candy running away from bed,

Free flowing, free will thoughts of running from expectations instead,

Run’n, Runnin, Running…

Taught not to run from my fears be running for wisdom to hear,

Don’t run from those near and dear for one day you’ll shed a tear,

Run from the glare of veneer and shine from the inside as pure,

Told not to run queer instead listening to my peers,

Runnin, Running, Run’n…

Epiphany reach no need to be taught how to run it’s almost as natural as the sun,

Running through class and on the field to say I won and am capable of carrying a ton,

Running through women and drugs to have fun until I see the tip of a gun,

Methodically running in sin towards the end perceived to be whole by none except one,

Running, Run’n, Runnin…

Unwanted challenges has me running from responsibilities like Trump,

Running deeper into the abyss to nowhere sliding comfortably into a slump,

Tormented like a withdrawing fiend running through dreams hitting a bump,

Frantically running from the encompassing darkness of the newly accepted societal dump,

Run’n, Runnin, Running…

Running to tie down to another in hopes that unity and multiplication bring clarity to the road trying not to implode,

Running to work and across town to pick up the children plowing through a stress furrow load,

Running on my last lymph node resisting to croak like a toad hopping to a new mode,

Running from debt the house is sold trying not to fold,

Runnin, Running, Run’n…

A reflection has me running from insecurities into programs selling hope like dope,

Recommended to run to help the body cope first thought nope followed by a begrudged mope,

Determined to make a change now running for office climbing the political ladder with a soaped up rope,

Dry bones dancing from the depths trigger running from the past like someone groped by the Pope,

Running, Run’n, Runnin…

Rally running with the wind at my back spark questions of who-what-when-where about the race and the pack,

My minds running towards the desired end for a sack - no time to crack when reaching for the rack,

Rules of the metaphysical game - run with the expectation and discipline to win giving no slack,

Introspect reveals running is a tool used by the wise and the fool to move on life’s track,

Run’n, Runnin, Running…
