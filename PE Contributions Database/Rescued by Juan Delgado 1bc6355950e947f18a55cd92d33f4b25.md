**Rescued by Juan Delgado**

Thank God for Prisoner Express, books, magazines, newspapers, a lil’ television, and legal material, but most important PE for RESCUING my sanity and giving me an opportunity to tap into my potential capacity to think as a human being. Being incarcerated is boring, with little to no resources to advance or achieve our intellectual capacity. Sitting in a cell all day with nothing to do, no financial stability or resources, deprives an individual of a normal mental state and diminishes our capability to think and explore our mind’s potential to create. It is difficult to advance our potential positive goals and dreams. Being able to develop a critical thinking curriculum rescues an individual from being close to a comatose state of mind and being robotized to the limited influences of a person’s current understanding. Such as what a person sees all day on TV or listens to the radio, or the conversations a person has with an individual's surroundings. Often our  point of view is very limited to then environmental culture we were last surrounded by, prior to our imprisonment. Most of the time we have  a negative point of view from how  the majority see life. To receive a different perspective with ideas and different outlooks and points of views from different cultures, ethnicity, and backgrounds  gives a person a varied look at life, an expansion of our own understanding to to the possibility that there is always something, if not better or at least different, and to have the opportunity to wonder and explore the possibilities. is a rescue from being close to a comatose state of mind.for for being stuck in a state of contempt of our own abilities and understandings. Thank you for rescuing my sanity.
