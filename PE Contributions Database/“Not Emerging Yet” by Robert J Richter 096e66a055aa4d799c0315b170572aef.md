**“Not Emerging Yet” by Robert J. Richter**

****Andrea can write about the physics of rainbows, but she is trapped in the fog, practicing a religion, not a science. Science is based on facts and logic, but Earth physics is based on incorrect assumptions and blind following. I’ll give you a simple example. In the 1860s, James Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism, and wrote the fundamental equations. People blindly follow his conclusions to this day. Even the most “advanced” physics is based on Maxwell’s work.

The problem is that Maxwell died before either electrons (1897) or protons (1919) were discovered. He did not have the necessary facts. A moment’s reflection reveals that the only possible source of “magnetic” attraction between parallel currents is an interaction of electrons and protons, that a current in a wire creates an overlap of positive and negative fields moving relative to each other. A particle or current moving through what Maxwell called “a magnetic field” experiences two forces. Maxwell’s magnetic force vector is the difference between them, not a force, not a thing, and not fundamental.

I was trapped in the fog for 30 years, wasting my time on things like magnetic fields, black holes, dark matter, and other such nonentities. Unlike most people, however, I do not follow people, only facts. Yes, I have been misled, deceived, or just plain wrong, but when confronted by the truth I accept it. I don’t blindly follow “experts” once I learn facts that they didn’t have. Apparently, I am the only such rational person on Earth.

I solved the Unified Field Theory, the “Holy Grail of physics,” in 2010. It took me four years to find a way to publish it. SInce 2015, the answers to all of the biggest problems in physics have been available, free to read, on the Prisons Foundation website. All of my conclusions are based on facts, facts unknown to Maxwell and Einstein when they published their greatest works. What will it take for people to wake up and look at the facts?

Write about rainbows, Andrea, and you shall remain trapped in the fog, unable to see even the simplest truths. You choose to remain surrounded by a cloud of false assumptions, incorrect conclusions, and blind ignorance. Any time you want, you can listen to my voice and emerge from the fog- it’s clear where I am- but will you? Probably not. It’s so much easier to pretend that the “experts” must be right, that you can trust them. Why listen to me, or look at the facts, when you can become another expert just be repeating what you are taught?
