**“My Body” by William Yarbough**

Sitting comfortably in his soft and plush leather recliner chair, Mark Sr. Is deeply emotional now as he exclaims in a proud voice, “Mark Anthony Dickerson Jr,” as he looks down at the small bundle of joy. “Flesh of my flesh,” Mark says to himself as he reflects how happy Shelly his wife has now made him. The innocent coos of little Markey D. instantly transports him to that special day Mark first met Shelly back in elementary school.

“Mark Dickerson,” the homeroom teacher yells. Ms. Flecker announces the names for roll call. “Shelly Montous,” she calls for the third time. Ms. Flecker calls out for the fourth time very impatiently. The class now looks around wondering who Shelly Montous was. In the background, you hear a soft voice ask,

“Hey are you Shelly Montous?” The young girl Shelly was rummaging desperately through her book bag.

“Yeah, I’m Shelly Montous.” She glanced up quickly.

“Ms Flecker is calling your name for roll call.”

“Ms. Flecker, I’m here,” she said, raising her hand quickly to get the teacher’s attention. “I’m Shelly Montous.”

That’s when Mark first saw Shelly. Her deep brown inviting eyes and her long raven black hair that gleamed with the classroom lights highlighting its shimmering glow.

All Mark could remember about their first encounter was her warm eyes that captured his soul with that long glance. His shyness seizes his voice, preventing him from saying hello or just acknowledging her with “Welcome to Woodlawn Pleasantville Elementary School.”

In life those days, Mark found each encounter with Shelly as a majestic orchestra languid flows. Seeing Shelly through the years, Mark’s lack of ambition to communicate his thoughts and feelings crippled his potential relationships. When Mark would see Shelly at the mall, grocery shopping and other events he would experience the spring-like internal bird songs that would echo casual pleasantries that stirred their heartstrings. Mark was just through in through, he just couldn’t muster the courage needed to share his feelings.

Now sixteen years after graduation, Mark has gained confidence, now owns a well-established printing company and has lots of friends. On many occasions, Mark went to social events hosted by his close friend Helen Lawson. As Mark was driving to this evening’s dinner, his mind played the performance as he always had done for Helen. “Just play your part,” he says to himself. He reminds himself again, this time he looked in the rearview mirror.

He found these social events very stuffy and boring, but Helen was a good friend who brought many well-paying clients over the years. Now walking in the massive cloister hall, the elegant decor was mind-blowing, for there were many penguin suits and glamorous evening gowns that this dinner would put the governor’s ballroom dinners to shame. Helen really knew her business. As Mark mingled, he smiled, said a joke or tow and greeted the people he knew. Then it happened, the air in the room changed. Like a distant song playing in the background. “Shelly,” he exclaimed softly, for Shelly was now standing there by the waterfall fountain.

As he walks towards her, she doesn’t see him. His walk became that much desperate as he sped up his pace, for this is the moment he searches for. Shelly now saw him and instantaneously recognized Mark from across the room. Their eyes meet and they danced. She smiled softly with an exigent glow.

For the first time, they knew true love’s gaze as they approached each other. As they introduced themselves finally the world around them seemed to disappear. The air now seemed to smell like the essence of seasonal change as they drink deeply the pinot noir of yesterday’s dreams and ambitions. Shelly and Mark were married six months later.

Mark’s reminiscent moment is interrupted by Mark Jr.’s cooing. Now looking down in awe at this sweet and precious gift, a passage comes to mind. “My offspring will be like the grains of sand of the sea.” Mark wants a big family, even though the world is so dysfunctional and is highly addicted to drugs. Mark now holds his son’s feet in his hands. The softness of his feet remind him of two radiant rose petals. His heart systematically melts as tears erupt down his face, for he’s happy. He calls out to Shelly, “Hey Shelly, come here for a minute?”

“Yeah, what do you need honey,” she says as she walks into the room.

“Come look at Mark’s little feet. Don’t they look like little rose petals?” Mark says proudly. Shelly tilts her head to the side as her long hair gracefully falls from her shoulder, she smiles and says tenderly,

“That’s nice.”
