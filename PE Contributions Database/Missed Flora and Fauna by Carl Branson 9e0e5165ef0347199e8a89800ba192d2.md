**Missed Flora and Fauna By Carl Branson**

The prison experience has deprived me of my favorite spring activity: observing the resurgence of local flora and fauna.

Growing up in the Chicago area, the earliest blooms to glimpse were crocus, hyacinth, and tulips while the barren wood of oak, elm and maple would display the first hints of green. Monarch and swallowtail butterflies, exotic moths and pollinators (bees, etc) would reappear to add color. The desert southwest’s colorful array of cacti, succulents, and tree blooms replaced these early life joys.

The bright white saguaro flower must be admired from afar unless you have a tall a-frame ladder for reaching the uppermost branches of the specimen. Succulents like agave, yucca, and the century plant (this blooms once every 100 years, hence the name) send up a central “spike” covered in delicate flowers. Then, there is the wildlife that becomes far more active as temperatures rise; from the many varieties of indigenous snakes to the typically reclusive tarantula and scorpion. Watching these critters as they go about their daily survival routines is fascinating to say the least.

Although still a few years in the future, my currently scheduled release date will grant me about 5 weeks to prepare for enjoying the beauty of spring in the desert. Until then, daydreaming with vivid memory providing detail will have to suffice.
