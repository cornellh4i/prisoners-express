**“Gloria’s Flute” by Jeremy Brown**

Gloria was a beautiful girl. She was only seven when her dad made her an oak flute. Boy could she play that flute. So wonderful were her musical harmonies and vibrations, all the forest animals would come around to listen. One day Gloria had an idea. You see, her father had recently died and she missed him ever so much. So Gloria got a shovel and started to dig up her father’’s grave. “I love you Daddy and I will bring you back to life and you can make me more flutes,” she said to the grave. Just then a wind blew her hair, a sign she took to start digging.

“Whew this is harder than I thought,” she said sweating. She then started to play a tune that the cheetahs and leopards and cats liked.

Once all the cats were around her she commanded them, “Okay everyone listen up I need you to dig right here.” She started to dig with her shovel. Then Gloria stopped and let the cats dig.

After an hour, a cheetah hit a hard surface. “Good, thank you my dear cat friends and tell the Goddess Bastet I love her and I am very appreciative.” The cats all left.

She opened the casket and her father was still dead-looking but more or less intact. She climbed out of the casket and fearlessly looked at his dead eyes while playing the flute. She played such a solemn tune even the trees bowed their boughs a bit. Just then a stir and a flutter and her father arose. “Gloria it’s you, you did it, you found the magic.”

“I did!”
