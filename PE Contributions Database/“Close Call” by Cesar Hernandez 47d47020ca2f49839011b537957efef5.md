**“Close Call” by Cesar Hernandez**

My friend Cara almost goes to jail for DUI. Cara’s grandparents move to Colorado. Cara only visits every now and then. She doesn’t like the cold.

One Halloween season she goes to visit. Grandma finally succeeds into guilting Cara to visit. She makes the long road trip by herself. In Colorado, she realized that our friend Valerie is also in town. Valerie flies instead of driving. Valerie invites Cara to a house Halloween party in the next town.

Cara is an eight. In her sexy bumble bee costume, she’s a perfect ten. At the party, Cara only has a couple of drinks. She leaves to drive to grandpa’s house. A state trooper pulls her over. She only consumed a couple of drinks at the party so she’s not worried. They trooper does a breathalyzer test on her.

She tests 0.061 BAC. She wants to jump for joy. At home, they legal limit is 0.08 BAC. The trooper tells her Colorado’s limit is 0.05 BAC. Cara’s stomach drops, she really doesn’t want to go to jail. She’s unsure if she should cry or not. Crying may or may not get her off the hook. She’s in the sexy bumble bee costume so she looks phenomenal.

The trooper says he has to take her down to the station. He asks if she has someone to come get her car. She calls Valerie. Valerie comes to get the car. The trooper drives slowly to the station. Cara doesn’t want to go to jail. It’s Valerie’s fault for inviting her to the Halloween party in the first place. If not for Valerie, Cara would be sound asleep at grandpa’s house right now.

At the trooper station, there’s a wait for the breathalyzer. Troopers are constantly bringing in drunks all night. The trooper doesn’t put Cara in the holding cell. He takes her to the side.

Cara is a very sweet person. She is being extra sweet and nice to the trooper. She’s unsure if she should flirt with the trooper. She doesn’t want to go to jail. Cara is being very nice and laughing at all his jokes and stories. They talk a couple of hours.

Finally the trooper leads her to the breathalyzer machine. She tests 0.048 BAC. He tells her he can’t give her a DUI since she’s under the limit of 0.05 BAC.

The state trooper drives her to her grandparent’s house. Cara is so glad she doesn’t get a DUI. She tells Valerie to drive with her on the road trip back home. Valerie has no choice but to agree. It was her idea to go to the Halloween party. Valerie hates road trips, yet she does save lots of money by driving instead of flying home.
