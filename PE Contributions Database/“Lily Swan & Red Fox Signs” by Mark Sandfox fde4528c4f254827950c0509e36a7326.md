**“Lily Swan & Red Fox: Signs” by Mark Sandfox**

Signs, Signs, everywhere were signs. Initially, Suzie had enlisted the power and numbers of her Girl Scout troop, little green dresses buzzing about putting up posters all over town. Her Girl Scout Leader asked Suzie to join her at council to tell her story. Now there was an entire county of little, and big, green dresses busy like buzzing bees, no surface to be left uncanvased. A few days later the Boy Scots got involved, then the CampFire Kids, and Awanas, and then…

“Hey Suzie,” hailed a high school cheerleader as Suzie was posting posters around the football field. “Gotta sec?”

Blonde hair, blue eyes, big boobs, thin and curvy, everything Suzie hoped she would grow up to be. The whole cheer squad followed behind their leader.

“So… like that photo… Did that really happen? Did that poor swan get all tangled up in that six-pack top?”

The poster’s title was “Lily Swan & Red Fox,” Suzie was not about to correct the girl that Lilly was a goose, not a swan. Below the title was a picture of Lilly in the wicker baby carriage with Red Fox pushing it. Between that and another picture, “Your garbage Could Have Killed Her,” then a picture of Lilly laying in Suzie’s front law, her webbed feet shackled by a six-pack top and clear plastic tangled around her legs, Below that, “HELP Cleanup Lilly Lake Saturday…” and all the contact information below that.

Suzie controlled her anger. “Yes.” Why would they question this? Wasn’t the photo proof enough? “It took me near a half hour to untangle her, and she was pregnant too. She almost started laying eggs while I was untangling her. That would have been bad.”

Cheerleaders are usually all smiles and giggles, there was none of that in this group. “I am so sorry,” whined blondie, “We didn’t know. They got us back pretty good though. It took me days of scrubbing before I felt clean again.”

Suzie had thought Red Fox and Lilly Swan were pulling her leg when they told her about their stinky raid on the “young evelers” as they called the.

“JIMMY!” yelled blondie, “Get over here. All of you get over here.”

The entire football team left their coaches stranded on the field, their coaches were none too happy, the worst they spewed were very naughty. Suzie was cast a shadow by towering hulks and short skirt beauties.

“This is Suzie Fowler,” presented blondie then stared down on Suzie, “They’re your friends right, the fox and the swan?”

Suzie gulped, bees started buzzing in her tummy , they were going to tease her, she just knew it. But Lily and Red were her friends and people are supposed to stand up for their friends. Suzie gulped down her fear, “They Are my friends.” Suzie held her breath.

No one laughed. No one giggled. There was not a smile or smirk in the bunch. The silence hung thick, thick enough to cut a steel knife. They were all just staring at her.

“Do you have any more posters?” asked blondie.

“I ran out of big ones,” quivered Suzie, “But I have a lot of the smaller ones.”

“David… You’re a part of the school newspaper right?” Blondie again.

“Yep, Chief Editor.” David was tall and wiry. He puffed his chest but there wasn’t much there.

“Okay, you make more copies. Everyone is going to show up for this cleanup… EVERYONE. And get some of the other teams to help out too.” Blondie started barking out orders. Everyone listened without interruption. When she finished she looked upon Suzie again.

“Please tell Lilly we are all very sorry. We will make sure it never happens again. Can we do anything for her?” Blondie was crying, not bawling or sobbing, but tears trickled down her pretty face.

“Well, she does complain a lot about the noise at night.”

Blondie smiled, “She does not need to worry about that ever again,” there was a general murmur of agreement, “I think we all learned our lesson on that account.”

Suzie giggled. So it was true, they had actually stunk up their partying. The coaches broke up their gathering, but not before getting an earful from blondie demanding that the faculty get involved with the cleanup as well.

After the cleanup, new posters went up around town. The whole town and nearly half the county showed up for the cleanup. Lilly, the Mallars, the Cnaadians and the Wood Ducks corralled their c hiks in the center of the lake while the humans cleaned everything up spick-and span. “Leave No Trace” plaques were posted at every entrance. Even the grumpy old mayor, who had been promising to cleanup Lilly Lake for years, showed up. His welcome was not warm.

The new posters had a picture of Suzie sitting by the clean shortline with Lily Swan and her chicks on her right, and Red Fox on her left, Suzie’s arms were wrapped around her two friends. The title atop the poster… “Suzie Fowler for Mayor.” It was so silly it made Suzie giggle every time she passed one.
