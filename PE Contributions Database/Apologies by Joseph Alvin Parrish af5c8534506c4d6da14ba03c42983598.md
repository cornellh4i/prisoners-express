**“Apologies” by Joseph Alvin Parrish**

Part 1

It’s not my intention to try and force your belief one way or the other; that’s your personal preference. But I have been commissioned by God to go to all nations and preach the gospel. I’m aware that there are a lot of folks who have beliefs different from mine and what they choose to believe is their choice. Making apologies is not going to amount to a hill of beans when we’ve finally reached the end of the road. There is one thing, though, that I feel I should convince you of--and that is that one day we will all have to give account to God for every deed done in our mortal bodies, and making apologies won’t be accepted. God won’t be trying to hear your pleas asking for him to be lenient with you. I think you should anticipate your final outcome, your just due.

Part 2

I’m fifty-four years of age. In fourteen days I will turn fifty-five years of age. February 13, 2018 marks a day of celebration for me. And I feel as if I owe myself an apology for the state of affairs that my life is in. I’ve gotten too old for this addictive behavior; my apologies are in order. First of all, I am giving thanks to God for his never-failing mercy and grace, for he has been patient with me for all of this time. I could have been dead, buried in my grave but because of his tender mercies the blood is still running warm through my veins, and I am still able to breathe a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, God is not looking for any apologies that I have to give. What God is requiring of me is a repentant heart. A repentant heart means that I’ve done a complete turn-around and I’ve had a change of heart and change of mind. I would assume that feelings of apology should fall somewhere in between those lines? And so just exactly who should I present all of my apologies to? Please allow me to think about the avenue I prefer to advance on? Okay take off! I guess it all started with the power of choice. And so, at what age did I become responsible for my behavior? Was it at age six, or was it seven, eight, nine, ten? At what age does accountability play an important part? What was the first point of acknowledgement? At what age did I first realize that I had committed a wrong, and how did I feel afterwards? Did I experience a sense of remorse or regret? Did my wrongdoing affect anyone or hurt someone? Was I mindful to apologize, or did I not care one way or the other? Come on and think about it. Tell me, what’s the vilest thing you’ve ever done and did you ever apologize to the person that it may have affected? It gets hard for me to remember. Sometimes I have a malfunctioning brain, but there is one thing I will never forget: however I fix my mouth to say it, in my heart I am apologetic to God for all of those foul deeds in my fleshly nature, but I am no longer being led by my fleshly nature. I will leave you to figure out what happened. However, my apologies are in order and I’m filled with gratitude because Jesus Christ loved me while I was still lost in my sin. How about you--what is your opinion of the matter? Do you acknowledge the fact that Jesus died for all your sins on Calvary’s tree?
