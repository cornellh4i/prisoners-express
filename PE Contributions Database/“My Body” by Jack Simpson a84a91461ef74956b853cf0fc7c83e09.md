**“My Body” by Jack Simpson**

Most people don’t like the way they look. I find it true also with myself. Let’s face the fact. We are who we are. The product of two people—our parents. One question I would like to ask others. “Why do we always want to change the way we look?” Is it because we thought our parents couldn’t do a great job?

Think about it this way: what would you change about your physical looks? Are you too tall, too short, too lean, too fat, or is it that you feel someone at the cost of thousands could make you into that perfect person?

I have found a few things I would love to change. It is too late in my life for me. My right rib cage, which holds the floating ribs that are curved inward and not like they should be. Also I have what is called an inverted sternum. Other than that, it is all I have found that could have been corrected years ago.

The choice is mine to let my body stay the way it is. I have been cut on due to medical procedures. To have my looks altered, I don’t think so. I am a true product of my parents. Why would I change what they gave me?

As I get older, I see parts that have shifted from a strong thirty-five year old to a sixty-year old. I was told walking and a good diet will help reduce the weight and add back to my body. Well, back here if this is called a diet, then someone give me a bucket of grease.

Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself where has my health gone. I am still here, but not the same person as I once was. As I said earlier, I have had surgery on my heart and neck. A few stitches later and I still get around. This isn’t something I wanted done to change my looks. It was to stay alive. That is why I don’t complain too much about my body.

Would I like to be anyone else? NO! That wouldn’t be me. So when you look in that mirror like I have, don’t put yourself down. Who I am and who you are are very important to our parents, siblings, friends, and most of all, to the world.

It doesn’t matter if you change the way you look on the outside. You are still you on the inside. Why would it be of my interest to change everything to please someone else, for them to then get tired of the way I look, to leave and find someone else?

Just like how the late Joan Rivers said, “I have had so much plastic surgery over the years. I can’t tell if I am smiling. Am I smiling?” The worst part of that is what doctors have done will soon come undone. Gravity will soon find and pull everything south. Even the best plastic surgeons can’t stop what is a natural part of our life.

This is my body and no knife toting doctor is going to change my face features to please anyone else. I ask that if you do decide to alter your body with anything like tattoos, plastic surgery, or anything that would take away from your looks, think really hard before you do it. I have and will not do anything to my body that wasn’t already there to start with. Besides, I love the way I look already.
