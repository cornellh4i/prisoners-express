**“Protected” By Efren Hawkins**

Life is a joy to live. If you are reading this, you have been protected. A lot of us, if we received what we deserved, we would have been gone. So, let’s look at the significance of our practical life. I sit here a middle aged gentleman and give thanks for all the protection I received to live this long. It took awhile but my eyes and heart were open to you can't do it alone. Some may see me as a lost soul, but my eyes have truly been open to the truth.

Let me share one moment where I see the change in me. One day a young man was talking to me, but he was talking loud where everyone could hear. I felt he was trying to impress some of his friends. So, I told him “If you want to talk to me, then talk to me.” After that I walked away, he then confronted me like he knew me. I got heated. But something told me “He’s a lost child.” I laughed and told him, “Look you ain’t gonna go where I’m gonna go. So we gonna let that go and I apologize.” I apologize even when I did nothing wrong. This shows me that there is someone protecting me from myself. I’m not perfect, but I’m getting better. Lesson learned!!!

I submit to my protector and try to let it reflect on my character and conduct, I seek His guidance and gain the peace that only He can bring. Life is a testing mission, but let’s work to establish a system of goodness, piety, and hope. We are more cruel and unjust to ourselves than any other being. We abuse ourselves by succumbing to our desires and that can be by overeating or we may go to the extremes and get lost in this and that. Let’s establish poise and balance in life. “If you don’t teach your mind and heart, it will be lost and empty.”
