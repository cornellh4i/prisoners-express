**“Beneath the Veil” by Thomas Littek**

There were few mourners and no flower arrangements at Jake’s funeral. The pallbearers, recruited from the homeless shelter, and would-be minister were there because they needed the miserly fee the widow offered for their service. Eve, the grieving widow, was there only because her presence was expected. And she felt cheated. The undertaker had charged five thousand dollars for this “economy” intermeat. A wooden casket and a hole in the ground. The nerve of that crook!

As the ersatz parson droned through the typical ashes-to-ashes, dust-to-dust homily, Eve stood like a cranky sentinel waiting to be relieved of duty. Her face wore a this-can’t-be-over-soon-enough expression.

Only twenty-seven, Eve was a young widow. A second-time widow at that. Just five years earlier she and her first husband, a spineless junkie who slept all day and brokered petty drug deals at night, struggled to pay rent on a dilapidated three-room apartment. But when he suddenly died a wave of prosperity rushed over her and within days she was living the good life. Today, funeral or no funeral she could hardly hide her smirk. For, as they were tossing dirt onto her husband’s casket, she was spending the insurance money.

Long before Eve was born her biological father deserted her mother, leaving her broke, pregnant, and desperate. As deadbeats go, he wasn’t so much missed as he was despised. Growing up Eve suffered along a steady train of steps and stand-ins, all of whom abused her in various ways, while her mother, wholly committed to drugs and men, was too spaced-out to care or even notice.

At thirteen Eve ran away from home. At first she roamed from couch to bed to shelter, Houston, Miami, Baltimore. Eventually she landed in Woodbridge, Virginia, a DC suburb, where she moved in with a girlfriend. At fifteen the girlfriend’s father drugged and raped her. Eve told the girlfriend; the father denied it. The family circled the wagons, pointed fingers at Eve, made all kinds of accusations and threats. Finally Eve dropped it and moved out. No chargers were ever filed, and she never forgot what the man had done to her.

In the years that followed Eve developed a feral restlessness. She seemed determined to find the darkest recess of life and embrace them as some kind of normal. She withdrew, began to cut herself, and dressed in black. She cultivated an array of sex partners, mostly men she picked up at drug dens. Add to that cauldron an ever-increasing measure of cocaine, heroin, and cheap liquor, a form of self-medication that quelled her inner scream but amplified the outer madness.

No one noticed, or maybe no one cared that Eve was burying a second husband within a five year period. The police, the insurance companies - no one questioned it. Their deaths were ruled as “natural causes,” and that was that.

Neither husband left at will. Probably because neither husband had anything of value to bequeath to anyone. There were, however, two insurance policies.

The first husband’s insurance policy was for half a million; the second was for two million. Two-point-five million dollars, and Eve was the sole beneficiary. With her pain now eased considerably she somehow managed to suffer through Jake’s funeral without a severe meltdown.

The insurance company stalled and balked as they always do, initially. But after her first husband, Eve was experienced, and prepared. After some calls and threats of lawsuits from her lawyer, a $200 an hour sleaze who had fine-tuned the practice of corruption into an art, they wrote the check.

A week later Eve was driving a new corvette. She and her latest boy-toy announced their plans to wed.
