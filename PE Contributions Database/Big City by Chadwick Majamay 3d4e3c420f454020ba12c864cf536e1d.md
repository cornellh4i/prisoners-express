It was the year 1997. The month? Middle to the end of November.

New York City! All the way from my small hometown of Hilo, Hawaii. Could you imagine your twelve year-old self going to New York City when you were raised on an island?! I could and I CAN!

Our elementary school (Keaukaha Elementary) decided to organize the biggest field trip in the history of my life. Since it was my last year in elementary grade school, our fifth grade class teachers were planning to take an educational trip to the east coast of the United States of America, visiting the American/historical sites in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

I remember that bus trip in New York City from the airport to our first hotel. The coach driver had on an Arabic music station on the radio. I thought to myself, ‘How exotic it was to be in New York City on a coach bus listening to Arabic music’. Then, I saw those townhouse duplexes along the cityscape, which I’ve only seen on shows like The Cosby Show! MAN! It was kind of weird and unreal to see those New York townhouse duplexes in real life, rolling by the coach bus’s window. An excitement came over me! Like, YES! I’ve finally seen something in real life that I saw on TV.

This was the only memorable memory I had on my trip that was so real and life-changing for me. I was now no longer a regular, small town kid but a metropolitan kid! That is what a big city does to you and your soul-- the excitement, the experience. This is what each big city in the world does to the soul in its own unique way, to each individual; Paris, Tokyo, London, etc. Each is full of a high-intense energy that grabs and takes a hold of you and leaves a memorable imprint in your heart and soul.

If it wasn’t for my fifth grade elementary teachers, my life would not have been the same. I wouldn’t have been prepared for my move to Reno, Nevada at the age of eighteen-- landing in Sacramento and driving over the Sierra Nevada mountain passes in 2002. I would have turned around and went back home!

THANK YOU NEW YORK CITY!
