**Running Through Dichotomies by Anonymous**

I used to run from the police, but now I run in circles around the track. Likewise, I used to run from my own mental demons, but now I run towards anything that could offer solutions, such as this writing project.

Philosophers like Jacques Derrida have said that all language involves metaphor, not just language we Ordinarily think of as “poetic” or “literary.” Indeed, the line between ordinary or technical forms of expression and literary ones may not be so bold. Other philosophers, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, have challenged the distinction between mind and body by demonstrating that the latter is not only an equally worthy object of reflection, but an equally worthy subject of reflection: the body is not merely another object, but the site from which we experience all the other objects in the world.

By putting these insights together in the first paragraph, we see how the literal and metaphorical uses of the word “running” illuminate analogous processes in the body and mind. This illumination is liberating. Prisoners often say, “the state has locked up my body, but my mind is free.” This implies that while prisoners can resist the devastating impact incarceration has on their minds, they are helpless when it comes to their bodies.

Fortunately, this is false. Prisoners get tattoos; prisoners engage in loving, same-sex relationships; prisoners fight for hormone replacement therapy and the ability to express their gender identity; prisoners exercise and play sports; prisoners fast or go vegetarian for ethical, spritual, or health reasons. In short, prisoners can and do use their bodies to resist the artificial, oppressive norms of the carceral state.

I have been liberating my mind since I’ve been incarcerated, but believe it or not, I am also liberating my body. I used to destroy it with drugs, alcohol, violence, self-harm, and unnecessary stress. Now I nourish and build my body, not in the least by running in circles around the track.
