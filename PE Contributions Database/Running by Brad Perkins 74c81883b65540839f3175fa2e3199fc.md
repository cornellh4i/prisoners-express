**Running by Brad Perkins**

On the crowded Greyhound headed west, I still reeled from what had happened. How did things get so violent so quickly? How did a stolen day of enjoyment end with someone losing their life?

With nothing more than what I could fit into a bag, I head out to a place where I know no one and better yet, no one knows me. No one in Ogden knows my secrets, knows I have blood on my hands.

Cheap hotels. Homeless shelters. Donating plasma and having to forge a lease at the library to do that. Menial jobs through Labor Ready and waves of gratitude when I land a steady dishwashing job.

Then a loud knock, the “manager” needs me to sign more paperwork - yeah right. Nothing but guns drawn, Kevlar vests and badges hanging on a chain. The bright lights of a television camera and then the first of a very long line of cold, lonely cells.

The running is over.
