**Spring Fever by Jack Simpson**

Saturdays around our house were not a time to sleep In. After a full week of work it sure felt wonderful to feel the heat on my face. Early morning sunlight has a way of bringing a person to life.

We called our area the “Mill Village,” because of the three mills that were in operation at the time: all three produced cloth, and it helped to put food on the table. My father worked the third shift, and whenever he caught wind that mom had spring fever, he would not come home until sunset.

During the winter months our home stayed closed up. But before we knew It, It would be time to raise the windows, open the doors, and prep the house for cleaning. Nothing would make our mother happier once the furniture was being carried outside. I wanted nothing more than to help my family.

My mother at that time and even upon her death did not weigh no more than ninety-eight pounds. She could not do any heavy lifting. I was not only her protector, but the man of the house.

When spring fever hit her, no-one was going to sleep in. That included myself. “Junior,” she called out. “Oh mom,” let me sleep for a little while longer. One thing I did learn and fast; she would not call you twice. There was a price to pay for that.

I do believe that dad must have had ESP-I'm not talking about extra sensory perception-what comes to mind Is extra slow perception! It took him forever to come home. He would show back up after everything was done.

The sun felt great on my back. My sister would tease me at how dark I would turn during the summer months. I can still hear mom say to my sister. “Leave him alone If you are going to finish today.” I’d smile at her, but I knew by that look, I had better keep an eye on her.

Breaks would come ever so often. One thing I can say about mom. We had plenty of cold sweet tea. She too stayed busy with bologna In a cast iron skillet. A couple of sandwiches was all It took for myself. Now that I am older, bologna now causes a rash to appear. What I used to love, now has turned against me.

I could handle lifting my end of the furniture. Since my sister was four years older than me, we managed together to bring out the last two items. Did I say the last two? Correction on that. Once I lifted my end of the dresser, I knew the mistake was too late. Flip-Flops are not to be worn doing jobs like this.

The bottom of the dresser skinned my big toe; but that was just a slight taste of the pain to come. My whole foot was In pain. The weight of the dresser rested on top of it. Thank goodness we never had carpet. Solid wood floors are a lot easier to clean.

I really do understand why my father never decided to be home when all of this was taking place. Oh yeah, I did let out a yell. This alarmed mom. My sister had to go all around the house to reach me. I knew she didn't do this to me on purpose. It seemed like forever when she lifted the dresser off my foot. Mom could only look in shock.

I didn't want to look or touch it. When I asked mom how It looked. All I got was “Umh! Umh!” That sure wasn't good news. The skin was broken and I sure could feel blood.

There was a wonder oil we used a lot. It relieves pain, soreness, and promotes skin healing. It is called red oil. It can be bought at a drugstore. Do remember I lived in the south.

Over the years, I found an easier way to move things without hurting my foot. A regular broom and a towel you can move just about anything. Lifting the heavy items up, place a towel on the floor, Place the broom on top of the towel, just center of the four red threaded lines, pulling with the handle. It will move it across the room.

When I got married and spring fever bit my wife, I pitched in and cleaned the rooms. One thing that did help was I wore boots and was careful where my feet were placed.

Unlike my father, I enjoyed cleaning the house. I have thanked my mother over the years for teaching me how to cook, wash clothes, iron, and to be thankful for the things In life we take for granted.

My sister and I are still close. All she has to do is ask and I will help her. Even if she has spring fever.
