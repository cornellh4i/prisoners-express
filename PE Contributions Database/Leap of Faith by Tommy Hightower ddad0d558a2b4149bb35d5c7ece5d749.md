**by Tommy Hightower**

****As an American military veteran, I am taking a major leap of faith in our nation and its citizenry in this yearâ€™s election process. I just cannot accept that we are really going to elect a man who exemplifies everything that is wrong with the nation: he is of a billionaire class of elitists who feels they are above the law and better than all other humans on earth. He stands for bigotry and hatred--and classism at its worst. So I am taking that leap of faith that Donald J. Trump supporters are smarter than that and are not really that biased and hateful.

I wrote a book that was released on Amazon.com and CrateSpace.com this summer. The title is *Cold Black Heart Syndrome* by Thomas A. Hightower [ISBN-13: 928-1-4951-8208-2]. This book is a must read for every person over 10 in the world because it opens the eyes of all to how people like Donald J.Trump can gain popularity against all common sense. Though I conceived the book, by epiphany from God in 2010, it still is so on point as to how, and why, people can be lead to believe something against the evidence or basic human decency today. Look at chapter 8 on Hate-mongering. It fits Trump to the letter. Be on guard for other Trump-like events in your lives. I have deep faith in human beings to pull back from the brink of destruction.

If not for my own leap of faith in just carrying on each day for the last 22 years of this sentence, I would have committed suicide long past. I think every inmate takes a leap of faith every day, just to carry on and try to do better than the day before. Let us all take that leap of faith, that our nation and its people are not all hateful, hurtful, and prejudice-filled elitists. Amen? Take the plunge and read my book. You will be glad you invested that $23 in your future because it will change your life, as writing it has forever changed mine. God Bless each one of you, and God Bless America. May our beacon of Liberty to the masses never dim.
