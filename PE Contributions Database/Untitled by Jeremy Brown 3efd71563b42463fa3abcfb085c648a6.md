**Untitled by Jeremy Brown**

Cause I’m sittin on the dock of the bay. Watching these here clouds roll by. All I wanna do is die, as I’ve lived a very full life. I’ve seen everything there is to see, I’m just a shadow in the night. I’m no longer afraid as everything has already passed by. I’ve shed every tear I could cry, all I want is for my spirit to fly, fly like an owl in the night, catching mice in a terrible fright. Cause I’ll be sittin on the dock of the bay all my worries have gone by. Stillness, All I do is constantly die. No more do I try “sigh.”
