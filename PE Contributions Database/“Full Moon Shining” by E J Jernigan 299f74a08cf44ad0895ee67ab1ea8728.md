**“Full Moon Shining” by E.J. Jernigan**

It wasn’t an easy defeat to accept. Though none of us would admit defeat, the hunt was over before it even started. No amount of eagerness or determination would have balanced the beam for me nor my kindred.

We navigated through several miles of knee-deep snow before fatigue set in. Even then, we didn’t abandon the pursuit purposefully. But with each of us needing to catch our breath, the pace dwindled drastically. By the time we ran out of forest we were topping a rise that gave view to an endlessly open snow frosted field. The only evidence that we were on the right track were the human shaped footprints that stretched beyond sight.

The cause was lost. The cold blooded monster had bested the pack. For the time being anyway. The thrill of killing in such a perilous territory would lure the bloodsucker back, and with each passing day we were maturing more and more. We will be ready.

As a wave of realization washed over me, I lifted my snout skyward, toward the full moon’s shining, and let out a sharp howl into the distance. The rest of my head and crunched my way back to the village.

Most people have the opportunity to live life on their own terms. To be this or to be that. At first this was a harsh shot to swallow. I was selfish and didn’t care anything about humanity as a whole. Constantly I asked myself, why me? I mean, who wants to be a slave to destiny?

That’s not a confession of being completely heartless though. I had just given it wholeheartedly to my lifemate, Lydia. The only time I wasn’t selfish was when it came to her. To say that I loved her doesn’t convey the half. So naturally when the murder rate hit and all time high and claimed her life with it, something in me snapped. The pain that I felt from the loss was indescribable. It was a pain that nobody should ever to endure. A pain that spread throughout society at a far quicker rate with me denying my role in the grand scheme.

I realized that somebody had to bear the burden so I accepted myself for who I was born to be. At all cost, it’s my responsibility to protect the living from the murderous walking dead. I started running with the pack and doing my part to exterminate the creatures of the night, yet my mind was still distracted. The numbness that I had slipped into was by far better than the initial shock and pain but served as a barrier that divided me from anything that felt normal or joyous.

A month passed by and the climate grew brutally cold. Snowflakes were falling from the sky in a rapid succession. Though I possessed the ability to shift into my wolf body, the conditions still make for exhaustively challenging hunting. A debate warred inside my mind of whether or not I wanted to brave such elements. Just as I was leaning toward staying in, I overheard an elder warning another hunter to keep an extra close eye on me. Tonight’s targeted cover was responsible for Lydia’s death. No way could I sit this one out.

Once we located the scent and were hot on the trial, I felt a buzz I forgot even existed. Through an opening in the canopy, a shining of the moon highlighted a slight movement of shadow against the white snow. Softly planting my paws, I crept in that direction. I was dead set on avenging the only person I had ever loved. As I made my way around a thick oak I caught sight of a vampire feeding mindlessly. With rage that would fill Bruce Banner with envy, I lunged at the monster, sank my teeth deep into his neck, and ripped it off his shoulders. The immortal being killed for the last time.

Releasing my jaws, the head fell to the ground and rolled half a turn. I looked up into the sky, past the falling snow at the moon, and released a long howl in victory.

Right there underneath the night sky, deep within, in a place that I had closed off, I felt a portion of myself that hadn’t been present since I lost Lydia.
