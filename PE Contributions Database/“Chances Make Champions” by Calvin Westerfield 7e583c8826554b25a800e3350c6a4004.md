**“Chances Make Champions” by Calvin Westerfield**

Every time someone has told me to take a “leap of faith,” it struck me as a very irrational piece of advice. In essence, what is being advised is to blindly rush or jump into a decision without any logic or facts about what you’re getting into. Impulsive action is never a good strategy.

My main problem with this expression is the “faith” part. There could not be a more ambiguous word in the English language that is so commonly used. Let’s look at this word a bit closer.

“Faith, *noun*. 1: Confident belief in the truth, value or trustworthy of a person, idea, or thing, 2: belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.” Am I the only one that feels a sense of bewilderment from reading those definitions? If I met you for the first time and asked you to borrow our car, would you give me the keys? Hello no! Why? Because you have absolutely no information about me to make a conscious decision on whether you could trust, or place confidence in, my returning your car. In fact, you would probably curse me out, which is logical because you have no reason to believe me. Or should I say “believe in me”? Though, what if you are religious? A little dogma always adds spice to mystery. Now history is not sure if the Apostle Paul wrote the Book of Hebrews in the Bible because there is no early manuscript evidence to support this. However, the King James Version (by faith) calls this book “The Epistle of Paul the Apostle.” Hebrews 11:1 defines the word faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” My respect for all religions will have me move on without comment on this definition.

When I think about venturing into the unknown and taking a risk or a gamble, the expression “chances make champions” comes to mind. If someone asks me my advice about whether they should put $300 on a Cubs win for the World Series, I’m going to say, “Chances Make Champions” then leave the decision ultimately with his reason of the likelihood of that outcome. There are plenty of statistics and data to make an informed wager.

So let’s throw the old, confusing phrase “leap of faith” out of our vocabulary and take a “shot in the dark” with “take a chance” or “go out on a limb.” My favorite world that sums this whole issue up is “salto.” It is rarely used and is the exact synonym to the phrase. Very practical word to use if you’re anything like me and hate speaking figuratively.
