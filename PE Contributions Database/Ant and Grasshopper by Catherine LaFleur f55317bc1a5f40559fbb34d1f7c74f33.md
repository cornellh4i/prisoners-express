**Ant and Grasshopper by Catherine Lafleur**

Camp Prisoney Land is located in a COVID-19 hot spot. Our tri-country area contains a little over half of the confirmed 30,000 infections in Florida which is about 16,000 cases. However, there are no infections at this camp. Not even as much as a sniffle. The nursing staff comes around to each cell and checks on us daily. We are all disgustingly healthy and resilient.

The only work areas open are the kitchen and laundry and they are busybusy like industrious ants. The sewing factory is part of laundry and my friend Jolie has been working seven days a week. Instead of making uniforms, our crew of eight seamstresses have been turning out masks. These ladies sew 2,000 per day on antiquated machines which are barely functional. Boxes of these items are going out the back gate to other prisons twice a week.

My friend Jolie, who is old enough to be my mother, is exhausted. She is so tired everyday that she falls asleep immediately upon sitting on the bunk. I like to have Jolie for tea in the afternoons. But she is too tired even for that. I made dinner for her, I organized some jerk chicken pieces, tomatoes and sliced cucumbers over noodles with ranch drizzling and, out of boredom, sliced apples to look like a flower. I despise cooking but it's the least I can do for my friend. I admire Jolie because I could never work 7 days a week like that. She is truly resilient.

In fact, like the lazy grasshopper, I have not been at work for a month. I have been lying around the dorm self isolating and washing my hands like Lady Macbeth. My stash of Smithsonian, National Geographic, and Atlantic Monthly magazines is depleted. I have read all my Joe Abercrombie novels. In a frenzy of boredom and book lust, I binge ordered a bunch of movies and free classic Ebooks on the jpay kiosk. The result? Sick of movies and one I am stuck with 2,138 classic novels full of misogyny and racism. Hint for the cautious reader, look at the label that says updated for today’s reader. It’s code for all the offensive racist and gendered stuff being removed. Envy me, please. I am desperate, obviously not very resilient.

Today is Sunday. Jolie is working and I have hit the nadir entertainment wise. I must resort to material of an embarrassing and morally ambiguous nature. I will now reveal a secret no non woman should ever know, a shameful secret. When a woman has nothing else to do, she shuts her cell door, gets under the blanket and reads...cat magazines. Yes, even now a two year pile of my roommate’s Catster, Catfancy, American Cat and Cat Life magazines await my reading pleasure. I have so far resisted the feline siren song but I AM BORED!!! I’m on a slippery slope here. At least Jolie has resilience, maybe I should make her some dinner.
