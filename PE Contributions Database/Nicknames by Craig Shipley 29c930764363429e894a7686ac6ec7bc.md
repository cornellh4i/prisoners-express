**by Craig Shipley**

Seems like everyone in prison has nicknames. They call me “Carolina” because I am from North Carolina.

Many monikers or nicknames are quite revealing, while others are funny or plain stupid.

I always like that the guy named “Tiny” weighs at least 250 pounds. How about the guy named “Tattoo”, that cannot even draw a stick figure and has no tattoos.

It is funny how some people will not even introduce themselves by their real names, only nicknames. I guess it could be a security thing in prison, but I personally do not mind being called Craig.

Hopefully if you have a nickname you like it. If you do not, change it. Be who you want to be.
