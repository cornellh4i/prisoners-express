**Clothes by Gerald Durst**

It has been said that “clothes make the man.” I must disagree with this statement. What we wear is a reflection of our personality and our mood.

Now, I do concede that there are times when we must dress outside our comfort zone. Job interviews, weddings, black tie affairs and other more “classy” occasions. These are times when you must look your best and give a strong impression.

In our everyday lives, our clothing choices reflect more of who we are as people. Whether that be as a prep, nerd, goth or even a slob, clothes are more about our personal choices.

Another thing about our clothing choice is comfort. We choose clothes that are both physically and emotionally comfortable. Our clothes will have a good fit so that we obtain physical comfort. Something that fits well, gives us breathing room and good freedom of movement. If you can’t get your hands or wallet into your jeans pockets, you might want to reconsider wearing them. It’s terribly embarrassing when a button pops, zipper unzips or a seam rips when you sit down.

But you also want to wear something that comforts you emotionally. Whether it’s a pair of sweats sitting at home, or a polo shirt while you’re at work or just out and about, you want to feel good about your choice of what you wear.

Yes, I’m serious. We all have comfort foods that uplift us emotionally, so it stands to reason that we have clothing that does the same.

For me, it’s a little bit of the Alex Rogan look (see The Last Starfighter movie). The white t shirt with an open flannel shirt, my jeans and boots. When I want to look nice then I change into a Western style shirt. I’ll ditch my usual ball cap for my felt cowboy hat.

Naturally, in the warmer months I’ll wear shorts with my t shirt/flannel combo. Now these are mostly my casual daily choices. I tend to keep a few polo style shirts for more casual-yet-stylish occasions. Or for when a higher-casual standard is needed.

As I said earlier, our choices can also reflect our moods. When we are upbeat and happy we ten towards brighter colors and flashier styles. We want to show that we feel good, are having fun, and want to share this with those around us. When we are down, upset or even depressed, our color choices may trend towards bland or darker colors to reflect these heavier feelings.

So you see, our clothes don’t make us. They just reflect us and represent us. They show the world around us who we are and how we feel.
