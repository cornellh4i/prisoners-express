**Life’s Purpose By Yankee Lawyer**

What is the meaning of life? Has it any purpose?

Some say the universe is the random scattering of shrapnel from an explosion that occurred 14 billion years ago. They don’t know where the explosive came from, who packed it, how long it was compressed into a space like the head of a pin, or why it was suddenly released. However bizarre it might seem to a sane person, even a bomb has a purpose.

This has always been recognized as a problem. It is finally starting to be talked about intelligently, not only in Christian apologetics, but also in science journals. Cosmologists, physicists and chemists recognize the evidence of intelligent design at all levels of the natural order of the phenomenal universe.

Still, people on both sides of the aisle -- “scientists” and Bible-thumpers seem to have tunnel vision. They don’t always see a forest when looking at trees.

If no one caused the Big Bang, no one observed it, and no one guided the genesis of the earth or the evolution of man, then no one is observing the Milky Way today; no one has discovered the First, Second, and Third Laws of Thermodynamics; and no one has predicted cosmological entropy and felt concern over this world’s increasing disorder and his own mortality. Yet we do worry about our apparently impending doom in a way no rock, tree or computer can.

“Scientists” dismiss questions about the causes of the Big Band as “meaningless”, although they obviously are not; but here’s the real question we should be talking about. What is the origin of the entity that views the earth, sea, and sky through this physical body (I’ll use the word “soul”, you might substitute “spirit”, “ghost”, or whatever according to your religious background)?

Every human being has one (a soul). Does it come into being *ex nihilo* at the moment of conception? Do unborn souls exist in *galut* somewhere outside of time? Either way, we must have a creator and a purpose. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom. Proverbs 1:7, 9:10

The purpose of man is to know and love his creator in this world and to be with Him in eternity. God has a further purpose for each individual.

If you’re contemplating your personal purpose, inspiration and helpful advice can be found in *Purpose Driven Life* by my cousin Rick Warren (I don’t know his exact lineage but my great great great great great great great great grandfather was Richard Warren). It’s a 40 day study -- please don’t take any shortcuts.

I was a lawyer. Actually I am a lawyer but I was an attorney at law. I didn’t trade clients or coerce people to plead guilty. I tried cases -- and won. I embarrassed crooked cos and corrupt prosecutors in their own courtrooms, in newspapers and on television.

No, I’m a political prisoner. People ask how I maintain such a positive attitude when most people my situation would have killed themselves or gone crazy. My own goals (all centered aroudn serving God and raising my children in knowledge and love of Him) have been thwarted by a perverted DA who has since become a judge; but God still has a purpose for my life. If I truly love Him, I will go to my grave seeking to know and to do His will.
