**“Mountain” by Teddy Lewis**

The clouds are gone and so is the rain. The beauty of the Earth is now showing itself, but you can’t really see it, at least at first. Notice how tall the trees are from the ground up right?

It must be the origin of a superior architect, yet it gets better by the second, does it not? Notice the streams align the purest water set to drop perfectly in place from a not too distant mountain ready to rain on the forest of my newly found home.

It’s where the origin of all life is and you and I know it. We deserve to in the realest ways. Endlessly, I need to consider the beauty of this forest and I will. I will.

Peace,

T. Lewis
