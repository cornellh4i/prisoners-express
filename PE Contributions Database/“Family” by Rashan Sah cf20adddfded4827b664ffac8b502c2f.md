**“Family” by Rashan Sah**

I’m South Asian. Family has a special place for us. I always wanted to start a family after finishing college. Most of the time I fantasized about playing with my kids, even though I had non. How badly I wanted to be a father.

Suddenly, life took a U-turn. All my dreams are shattered. Sometimes I wonder: What is life? What is our purpose? Why do we come into this world? All I wanted was a small, little family. Was it too much to ask?

This theme picture made me very emotional. It has been imprinted on my mind. I don’t know what the future has in store for me. I would definitely want to start a family if I get a second chance. I can’t wait to have someone calling me “Dad”!
