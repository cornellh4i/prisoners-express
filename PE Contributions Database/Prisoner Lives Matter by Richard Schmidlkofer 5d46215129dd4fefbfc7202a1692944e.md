**Prisoner Lives Matter by Richard Schmidlkofer**

My name is Richard Schmidlkofer. I have been in WI prison for 25 years. Even through WI DOC are not the worst prisons for death cases it has happened in my lifetime.

I will start out today since we have over 300 cases at OSCI of COVID-19, not including over 20 staff members, but we are not the worst - KMCI has over 600 inmate cases and over 60 staff cases. 1 death at OSCI and 2 deaths at DCI.

When I was at WCI, I saw an inmate running down the tier covered in blood, he had cut his throat and both wrists. Another time an inmate climbed on the segfence razor wire and there was blood everywhere.

At RCI, in seg, I’ve seen an officer who did not care that he slammed and trapped an inmate’s hand and broke it. I have also seen them misure the taser and pepper spray on inmates in seg and GP.

At CCI in seg, I saw an inmate grab the female sgt’s belt; he was tethered to the food at medication time when this happened, and the sgt pulled away then several officers and white shirts came in and tackled the inmate while he was still tethered to the door. They started beating him with sticks and pepper sprayed him. They strapped him down on his bed naked. Also if you are on suicide watch they sometimes have uou naked in OBs. There are 4 more cells where you can see a person naked. Another time at the same prison, an inmate hanged himself in intake. I was a couple of cells down. The officers laughed, joked, and took a video. He was placed in a body bag, and ambulance staff and the coroner were there.

I put my experience last as it is still hard to talk about. On August 1, 2003 at RCI in seg, my mother, Rose, died. It was very hard on me. On that day it was raining (I took this as a sign that God was crying with me). I’m a cutter, I have cut my wrist and legs with razors and a tweezer, pulled out my toe nails, pounded my head on a wall and window bars (leaving blood everywhere) and took all my non controlled medications (blood pressure, water pill, aspirin, Nican, and diabetes). At RCI the staff and doctor gave me this liquid to drink to make me throw up, the only problem was that I did not eat or drink anything that day. I was taken in a ambulance and my blood pressure was low.
