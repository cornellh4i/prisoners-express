***She’s the Reason for My Laughter* by RJ Clayton**

A woman seeks out two things from a man: authority and femininity, each of different spectra. And also, within their own times. There is no exception to what I say.

If the woman seeks out the manly aspect of your masculinity, she will distance herself from you. This is when she needs to hear your words, when she seeks out reassurances. Use phrases like “I’ve got you” and “just keep this house, and I will take care of everything else.”

The more masculine the need, the more things should be shown. Speak only a few words. No more than is absolutely necessary. This is the best time to give her as much money as possible. Even more so, to purchase things for the home. Especially, that which will benefit children. Any child. For a real woman will always care -- if even just a little bit -- for all children.

When the woman seeks the femininity within your masculinity, she will draw close to you. This being the time she is most touchy-feely. At this time, you should speak beautiful words to her. Like “what is it like to be beautiful” and “smile, the world is beautiful because you’re in it”. Though the latter is spoken best in the plural form such as when many of the women in your life are gathered together during the holidays.

Giving her written words also counts. The more original, the better. With regards to that though, it’s not that hard for you to give some of your time. But know, this is also the best time to push, as she rubs on you. For it will make her want you more. Just blame it on her monthly cycle. Which should be around this time anyway. If not, blame it on the fact that she is far too along with the child.

We all want the best for our children. Even, and especially, when they are in the womb still forming. So understand, and teach her. The soul is born, at the highest level, twenty-nine days before conception. As a result, it is then born into three more realms, before coming into our world.

Now, know this. Whenever the sperm and egg congeal, the hard spark is there. This opens the well of souls. Then, the shekinah comes down to Earth. For this reason, you should never have an abortion. For even if you were raped, the Shamayin will make a way for the child. As it too deserves a chance at the tree of life.

You see, the heavens, called Shamayim in Hebrew are made up of two parts. Aish, which means free, and mayin which is water. The Frozen waters of space are filled with plankton. The fires of all stars are born from the congealing of the plankton. As their friction heats up, to create the initial burn. Have you ever touched dry ice?

But even the Shamayim needs something more to complete it. So, the man and woman join to give birth to sons and daughters. Then the daughters cling to her father while the son will cling to his mother. Thus, forming the x-factor. That is, in and of itself, a mirror of the divine. And that at the highest level, in fact.

In heaven, feminine is fire, masculine is water. On Earth, masculine is fire, feminine is water. Because we are the finality of the Shekinyah, the source of all feminine. And YHWH, the source of all masculine. But there is still much situated between us and them, which is why the Song of Shlomo was written. Even more so, why Shlomos’ Temple was built.

Our bodies and the pieces of the temple are one and the same. A woman’s vaginal walls are the outer pillars. The male penis is the priest. His sperm, the high priest. The Holy Place is the womb. And Holy of Holies, her ovaries. But the sacrifice must be made first. Just as when you make love to a virgin, you must break the vulva, and she must bleed on you. This is the true marriage and reason it is called the hidden pillar of beauty.

Cherish her. For she is the greatest gift ever given to you from your starry parents. In this way, you honor thy mother and thy father. So long as you treat her well. But also, her son and daughter by you. Because in this way, you and her become one. Which means that you can never truly belong to another. For the celestial marriage is the true marriage. The pure one. Believe her blood is binding. And virginity important.

Believing in her, and the family you make is also equally important. For they will become the reason for your laughter. Yes, the innocent child in its mother’s loving arms cannot be held up in comparison to anything else. But you must shelter them with all of your authority. While, at the same time, bestowing great compassion on them. Even you come from both father and mother which most certainly did not leave you without circumstances that at least taught you temperance.

Now even if you were abandoned yourself, or neglected in any form, you should know it’s not right. And that to abandon or neglect others is the worst thing that a parent can do. For the Shekinyah has never abandoned us. Neither has YHWH. Which is why we must care for widows and orphans to the best of our ability. That they may also share our laughter. We must also fight for fatherless children, and teach them. After all, a fatherless child wrote this for you and yours.
