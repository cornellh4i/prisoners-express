**“Flowers” by Jeremy Brown**

It’s 2008 and on January 3rd I was released from West Palm Beach County Jail. I was only 17. Skip ahead to Valentine’s Day. I’m still fresh out so everything feels very new and pristine. Well, my sweet heart from middle school- 8th grade- hooked up with me. Both of us are adults now and still unsure of ourselves, but we decided to move in “together.” It started with me giving her roses at least once a week. You see, she was my first- she took my virginity, not the other way around. So now I thought I was in love, but it was just lust. She was very manipulative, and had power over me in various ways. She tried to completely control me. As an Independent and Individual this was suffocating to me. But she wanted to get married to me and I said “yes.” Until I found out that she had feelings for another guy who she used to be with. She would mention him occasionally- how she missed him- I would sit and listen, afraid to say anything because I thought that I loved her. I mean, we go back to middle school, we have history, you know. One day I stopped hearing from her. I knew it was gone, you know that spark of energy, that fire between two young lovers. Gone. I could feel the emptiness in my stomach. So I moved back in with my parenty. Late one night I bought some roses and spray painted them black. I left them on her front doorstep. On her door I spray painted a note that said “And death do us part.” Yet after all these years later I still have love for her, that’s what’s baffling.
