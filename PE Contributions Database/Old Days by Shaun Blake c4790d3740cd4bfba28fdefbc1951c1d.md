I fished into the Utah State Prison in April of 1987. I was nineteen years old. The difference in the way things were run in those old days from now are like hot to cold, love to hate, life to death.

Then, we were treated almost like wayward brothers and sisters who needed a time-out before being allowed to go home. Now, we are treated like trash picked up off a street gutter and thrown away - hopefully not to be seen again.

Then, R & O was two to six weeks with evaluations, medical and dental check-ups, classification - I was even interviewed by inpatient drug program members (not called inmates) and given a tour of their block by the residents. Now, R & O is three to six months of lock-up with ninety-five percent of this time spent in a two-prisoner cell getting out to shower an hour a day. During time R & O period you’re only allowed the bare minimum of hygiene items: soap, shampoo, deodorant, comb, emoryboard (no finger or toenail clippers), and a razor once a week to use for a short time before returning it. Also, you can have paper, pen (no pencil), and envelopes.

Then, Utah State Prison still had a farm, a slaughterhouse, meat packing, a dairy, a fishery, a conservation greenhouse and crews, road crews, and one of the top rated firefighting programs in the nation - of prisoners or free citizens. Now, we have none of those opportunities. There’s a small Utah Correctional Industries, employing less than three hundred people and a few outside-the-prison crews employing less than two hundred people.

Then, the visiting time for the general population was on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday; totaling thirty-two hours of contact visiting with whomever wanted to visit you. The minimum-security prisoners could earn furloughs, with approved sponsors, of up to thirty-six hours on the weekends and holidays. Now, the general population is allowed a maximum of only twenty-four hours a month, in two-hour blocks, for visiting. Only family members, one single female (or male for the women), children have to be *specially* approved, and all visitors have to be background checked and on your approved visitor list. If anyone wanting to visit you is on another prisoner’s list (even a husband, wife, mother, father, sister, brother, children, etc.), they can’t unless they get removed from the other prisoner’s list and put on yours, and vice versa. These same rules apply for minimum-security prisoners - no extra time, no furloughs, no conjugals - nothing.

Then, the Criminal Justice goals were to separate the convicted from society, offer educational, programming, and religious services; jobs were mandatory; a pretty much determined amount of time to do (although Utah has always had indeterminate sentencing) with a transitional program back into mainstream society. Now, even though we are offered all of the above in principle, jobs are scarce (only about fifteen percent of prisoners have jobs out of the sections), the programming and education superficial, religious services are actually better, only a few prisoners go through structured transition programs, and the Board of [no] Pardons is giving as much time as they can get away with.

Then, there was only about five percent of the prisoners considered maximum-security status, the only prisoners in county jails were in protective custody (about five percent), and the rest of the prisoners were considered medium-security status (about sixty percent). All housed at one central facility except the protective custody prisoners. The total population was only about two thousand, two hundred prisoners (1987). Now, between fifteen and twenty percent of prisoners are in maximum-security housing, less than ten percent are in minimum-security housing, thirty-five to forty percent are housed in county jails (which is tantamount to being housed in Maximum), the rest are divided between two facilities (about thirty to forty percent) of medium-security. The prison population is now between seven thousand and seven thousand, five hundred prisoners (could be more). An increase of about three hundred forty percent.

Throughout history correctional ideologies have been in a constant flux. With harcore punishment on one end and rehabilitation philosophies on the other. Over the past thirty-plus years American correctional practices has went so far to the hardcore end, the Scales-of-[un]Justice have broken - throwing off into obscurity the people that are supposed to be helped by the system (this includes the victims). Mass-punishment; solitary confinement; psychological torture; outlandishly long sentences; inadequate programming, education, mental and medical health care services, housing, diet, job training, re-entry services, parole officers, etc...The privatization of prisons has created a system with a revolving door of mass populations - the more prisoners, the more money.

Although, recently there have been tremors felt in the scales of justice. Almost like it is having a service evaluation of damage: seeing what, if anything, can be done to fix it. The tremors are slight and sporadic, but they are felt. Hopefully society can get to work and fix the Scales of Justice for good.

Unfortunately, I believe there isn’t the desire or the skill needed to accomplish this task.
