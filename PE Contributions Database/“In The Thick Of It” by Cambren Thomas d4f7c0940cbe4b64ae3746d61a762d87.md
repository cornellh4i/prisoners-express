**“In The Thick Of It”** by Cambren Thomas

I sat in the calm silence of the waning predawn, doing my best to scan through Mother Nature;s dense veil of white and grey. Today was definitely not the day for her to hide her secrets from me. I glanced at the foreboding declination of numerals flashing across my watch timer. In another minute and thirty seconds, I would jettison this melancholic morning meander.

That was when I noticed it. Appearing in my rear mirror, an ominous apparition came creeping through the milky mass of nebulosity. I rubbed my eyes, hoping that the friction would somehow enhance my field of view. My nerves ascended to sobering levels of anxiety within me. It couldn’t be? My eyes darted back to the diminishing digits that were currently occupying my watch face.

**ONE MINUTE LEFT -**

I looked back up, and watched with resolute dread, as the edgeless form came further through the thicket of vapory haze. It slowly transfigured into the metallic contours of a patrolling police cruiser. There were two officers inside. By the looks of them, they were young, vigilant, and pretentious. They probably had something indefinite to prove to the meticulous metropolis they served - However, I would prove them wrong if they decided to be a little too curious.

At  such an early hour, parked in front of such a prestigious place of pecuniary profit, the rugged silhouette of my armored sedan easily roused the interests of the officers. They squeaked to an idling halt, close behind me. I tried to ease my mind with the notion that perhaps they were just hoping to run my sham of a license plate number through their criminal databases. My gaze briefly returned to the ceaseless countdown upon my wrist.

**THIRTY SECONDS TO GO -**

I stared back at the two officers through the tinted and impenetrable obscurity of my rear window. One of them was now motioning his spotlight in the y direction, searching to no avail of course. The other badge was typing into her laptop with one hand, and reaching for her radio with the other. I smoothly retracted my sunroof, and released my silence glock .19 from its holster. Tapering wisps of beclouded matter invaded the interior of my four-wheeled fortress. The alarm on my watch chimed to life in a high-pitched, 8-bit, stutter.

**TIMES UP -**

I rose to greet my unexpected guests with an incisive fluidity and aim. From my peripheral vision, I could see my crime caper cohorts heaving our heavy haul of pilfered  currency out onto the sidewalk. They were hulking and unfocused shadows amidst the billowing murk. The two impetuous officers had no time to react to my crooked comrades’ abrupt appearance. I squeezed the trigger of my automatic pistol in three short bursts. A rapid succession of muted flames and molten lead sliced through the thick and feathery pall. Splashes and smatterings of crimson and splintered glass made their cruiser a grisly tableau of grim mortality.

I turned and sat back swiftly, discarding my temporal fears through a deep exhale. My amoral associates, and our load of larcenous loot, were inside the vehicle like flashes of fleeting lightening. I pressed the ignition, and shifted through the gears, to begin our gliding getaway. Mother Nature dispersed her shroud of suspended mist from my path in curling crests. I felt comfort in the thought that these compacted and rolling waves of atmospheric molecules were reminiscent of the tropical surf I would be retiring to shortly.

We rode onward, in a triumphant and mesmeric silence. A smile of relished relief had begun to chisel its curvature into my long hardened facial features. I pulled off my mask, and allowed the wind to take it from my hands, into the oblivion outside of my shutting sunroof. The blurred and blended hues of daybreak had begun to rise and saturate through the receding meteorological muddle. I eagerly smashed my foot forward on the accelerator - speeding toward the feeling of finality and financial freedom.
