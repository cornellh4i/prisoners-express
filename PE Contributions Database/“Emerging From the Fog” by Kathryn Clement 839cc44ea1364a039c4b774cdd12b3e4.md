**“Emerging From the Fog” by KC**

It started in April 6, 2012 when the fog set in.

Been battling the “pirates” of this situation and living in prison.

Battling in a fog where you can’t even see in front of your face yet you can hear the voices.

Then like the voice from heaven reached down and His hand pulled you out of the fog.

You have searched the next level of life, out of the fog into peace and harmony.

Thank you Jesus my Savior for saving me.

In Jesus’s name.
