**The Girl and the Dandelion by Tamilyn Robertson**

The first glance of the portrait looks like an anchor of a ship. Then I thought it looked like a Greek goddess overlooking millions of her children. Finally though, when I really focused, I saw a little girl bent over, engaging in the beauty of the branches not fully bloom.

This interim made me ponder about how we as individuals view situations at a glance, an afterthought or the next day. So I am grateful to have a chance to view things more than once. For when we take out time, pray, and then act, we have much successful outcome.
