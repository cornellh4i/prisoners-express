**“A Strange Oration” by Jacob Ecker**

You and I, we are alike… in ways you could not possibly begin to imagine. I know you reserve deep feelings for me; it’s mutual too, really now, now more than ever, it’s imperative you implicitly understand this.

We’re freaks, you and I, social outcasts. I by choice, you by nature. Or, it could be vice versa… hmm..

Regardless, as misfits strange and unique, I want you to know my true feelings, even though I don’t really understand them.

I respect you; I value who you are. I respect where you’ve come from and the life you want to lead now. Life is but a transition you know, consistent in its inconsistency, much like me and so much more like you.

I’m not sure what our mutual attraction is based on and I really don’t care because I have you and you will always have… me. And it’s okay to be the odd number. I like to think that folks like us keep shit interesting. I mean, life can be so fucking repetitive as you know, and I have never been one to get lost in the monotonous banality of it all.

So, let’s continue to be strange and unusual. If the world is but a stage, let us be the best act and take our last bow together. There are no other people better suited to the task.

And now, at long last, I finally realize… I love you.
