**"Island" by Cesar Hernandez**

Jake has his own private deserted island in his backyard. His family property includes an eighteen-acre private lake. Jake kept begging his dad to let him build a fort on the island in the middle of the lake. His dad realized that Jake would never stop asking for the fort, so he finally caved and allowed it. Jake had big dreams. He would have a simple one hundred square foot room with the door facing towards the north. Twelve stars would be carved out of the rocks and placed on the ceiling. There would be a fire pit so Jake could cook and keep warm. It took eight long months to make Jake's dreams a reality but finally, the fort was finished. Jake would row in his canoe every morning to his island, and wouldn't come home until it was supper time.
