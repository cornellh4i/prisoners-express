**“Country Road” by John Naylor**

She was so proud of the baby buggy she got for her babies. It was a dream come true. A farm in a nice little quiet spot with a country road. She’d lost quite a bit of weight after the birth and was excited to walk in her neighborhood with her babies to meet her next goal. She sang songs as she walked along enjoying the air and appreciating the shade of so many trees. Despite being legally blind she saw a four-legged creature rushing in dark and fast. Then it barked. It tried to bite at an opportunity. She stood her ground to save her children, willing to let the dog maul her first. She shouted as the dog barked back. Adrenaline coursed through her veins, limbs stronger than they normally were yet somehow feeling weaker. “Get back!” she continued. They both stood their ground in a territorial stance now. Every time she turned or tried to the dog would advance looking for a target of any kind. She pushed the baby buggy down the grey and black asphalt gaining inch by inch. Until they were safe. Never again would she walk without something for protection again. It wasn’t just her anymore. Momma bear had babies. And she still loves them.
