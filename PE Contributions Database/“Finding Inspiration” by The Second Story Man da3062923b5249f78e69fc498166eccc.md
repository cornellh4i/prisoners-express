**“Finding Inspiration” by The Second Story Man**

Pardon me for trespassing upon your day. But, I didn’t come here to steal your thunder nor to rob you of your peace of mind. I just saw an open window of opportunity in passing and thought I would poke my head in and introduce myself.

Like a thief, who stole a dictionary from the library, I got a way with words. And, like that dictionary, where “life” comes after “fifty” and “death” comes before “parole”.

I live in a concrete box. On the outside, it’s drab and inornate. With the comings and goings of various sized packages enveloped in white. It arouses the curiosity of other dreamers, poets, wordsmiths, and artists alike. But, on the inside, it’s full of powerful words, not those of meaningless conversations, but words of love, hope, and understanding.

Now, some have questioned the origin of these words:

Were they sent in from abroad? Are they relics of an ancient civilization unheard of in this space of time? Why are they neatly kept under wraps and secured in a concrete box of yore?

There in the landscape of my mind, those powerful words of compassion sprung forth. Trickling over various obstacles while seeking their own direction, they entered into the stream of consciousness. As the momentum began to build and given voice, they became a babbling brook. When the torrential downpour finally came, they turned into a swollen river upheaving all those bridges of the past that were once built on solid ground. With the ebb and flow of the river emptying into the gulf, I rebuilt my structures and with a stranger’s support that could carry the weight of these words, I sent them onto their destinations.
