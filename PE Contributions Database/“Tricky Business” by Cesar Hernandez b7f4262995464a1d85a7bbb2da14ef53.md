**“Tricky Business” by Cesar Hernandez**

USMS F.I.S.T. is looking for me so I go on vacation. I don’t even know where I am going to be. My wife figures out where I am without me letting her know.

I’m on vacation without a care in the world. I have Cartier eyeglasses and a short beard. I have no desire to run into someone I know. At the same time, I want to look different so I’m not easily recognizable.

I’m at my Encore Tower Suite. Something tells me to check my secure e-mail account. My wife wrote a couple of days ago and says she’s coming to town. She asks if I’m at Bellagio.

I have no idea how she knows where I am. I send her an e-mail letting her know I will be at Bellagio when she arrives. I completely trust my wife. I know she would not deliberately tip off law enforcement. At the same time, I have no idea if she’s being watched.

I check out of Encore and move down the street to Bellagio. I have about two days max before my wife arrives. She’s taking the long route into town.

They say it’s not adultery if you’re not wearing your wedding ring. Something tells me my wife will check if I’ve been wearing my wedding ring. I need to get some sun so I can have a tan line on my ring finger.

When my wife is close to town, she sends me another e-mail. I gave her our Bellagio suite number, I tell her to call me upon arrival. Security will not let her up by herself.

There is a knock on my suite door. I look in the peephole. It’s my wife. She should not have been able to come up without a valid room key. I have no way of knowing if the metro is just out of view or if my wife is by herself. She knocks again and says she knows I’m in there looking at her. I open the door. I see there is no one in the hallway. I ask my wife how she got past security. She says she sweet talked him. I keep thinking that metro or F.I.S.T. will kick down the door at any moment. I ask how she knows I’m at Bellagio. She says she looked at a U.S. map and figured out in twenty minutes.

My wife is inspecting our suite. Something tells me that she’s looking for signs of another woman. She says she’s just looking at the suite since she hasn’t been to Bellagio before. She says I’ve gotten some sun, I say it’s sunny every day so you have no choice but to get some sun. She says my wedding ring looks dirty. She takes off my wedding ring. She sees I do have a tan line so obviously I have been wearing my wedding ring.

My wife brought my Cartier timepiece from home. She does like my Cartier eyeglasses but not my beard. She says I need to shave my beard before we have dinner at Le Cirque. I tell her I’m thinking dinner at Del Taco. I tell her it’s a lot better than Taco Bell. My wife says she didn’t travel all this way to have dinner at Del Taco.

My wife says I should come back home. I tell her there is a warrant for my arrest. After three weeks my wife goes back home. She takes my Cartier timepiece back home. I stay to continue my vacation. I start growing my beard again.
