**“Fantasy Forecast” by Carl Branson**

****Fear U. Friend will be the central character in my forthcoming novel *Fantasy Forecast*. Rounding out Fear U. Friend’s crew will be prior knowledge, life experience, and I.M. Courage. These androgynous characters will be ever present specters who aid all other characters in either achieving desired goals or avoiding disasters.

For the ambitious but cautious entrepreneur, they will compel rational thought necessary to overcome obstacles for success. The angst ridden traveller will gain the steel spine needed to board the train, boat, or plane. For the terminally ill or mortally wounded patient, these characters will provide comfort through visions of a glorious afterlife--whether or not one is truly achievable.

In their supporting roles, Friend’s gang is especially critical to those seeking adventure. Whether it be hiking a forest or desert, or facing an armed adversary where nemesis will frighten and dread will appear in the form of wild animals, poisonous critters, an enemy army, or a city mugger. In these situations, knowledge and experience will shoulder the bulk of the burden to bolster Courage’s resolve and Friend’s caution while working together at a frenzied pace.

Watch for the adventures of Fear U. Friend and his gang in *Fantasy Forecast*, scheduled for publication February 31, 2018.
