**"Family Reunion" by David Alvarez**

I’ve only been to one family reunion in my life. Yet it was awesome to be surrounded by people I care about and cared about me. I feel that communication with family is one of the most important things that there is. For me, prison is a difficult place to live in, yet it is family support that keeps me strong. If it wasn’t for one family member sending me money, I would have a difficult time here. I’m actually glad I don’t treat my family badly. I was always giving, kind, and fun. I always spoke to them with a touch of wisdom and honesty. I’m Mexican so my family is always together. Yet when all of us are together it’s always important. I just always try to remember that family is there to help each other out. There’s a saying I heard: “You alone must do it, yet you can’t do it alone.” It reminds me that family must be there for each other. In my life there were times I felt alone, yet that was because I was living in a city where I had no family. So when I visited my family one summer, it was wonderful. It went so well I decided to stay in that city for two years. It was being reunited with my family that made me feel better. I don’t know why I ever gave that up. Being with my family somehow gave me time to do things I love. My hometown is a big city with 1 million people. So there’s always things to do. So I got lucky in the fact that a lot of my family lives in one city. Yet all other cities are lonely. Even when I get out of prison I can’t wait to be reunited with my family. I know my family will help me get back on my feet. And when I get some money I’ll give back to my family. Family, it’s one of the most important things in life.
