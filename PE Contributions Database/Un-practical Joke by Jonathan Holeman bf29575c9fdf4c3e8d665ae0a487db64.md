**"Un-practical Joke" by Jonathan Holeman**

Most people find it amusing to play a trick upon a beloved friend. I’ve never understood this, and it’s been many friends’ fated end. Once we part our ways, they’ve become as if they’re dead, at least inside my head.

I do not want any tricks played upon me, in jest, joy, or just pretend, because it isn’t very funny when they’re laughing and you’re not in the end.

Is it all just unpractical practical jokes? If it is, it is; I’m just assuming. Fires, explosions, running from their homelands in search of misguided hopes. Isn’t this all just some practical joke? When the media feeds a broadcast about some whore in Hollywood’s million dollar dress, does anyone else laugh at how this matters when the world is in distress. Or laugh when they idolize some weirdo showing photos of his penis on the web? Shouldn’t we consider anything, anything else, instead?

Is everyone still laughing when they talk about the dying elephants, pandas, lions, tigers, and rhinos killed in practical ways. Do they laugh about the children shooting and killing others, and now lying in their graves? Is it very funny when cancer invades a host, or is it just the cruelness that they call the practical joke?

They seem to find it quite amusing again and again. So when I laugh, it isn’t practical. It may be properly considered quite a bit insane because I find amusement in how they are so blind. The jokes I never play are never quite on time. In every little joke they play, another innocent starves beneath a blistered sun, and they are all laughing, then another will pass another one.
