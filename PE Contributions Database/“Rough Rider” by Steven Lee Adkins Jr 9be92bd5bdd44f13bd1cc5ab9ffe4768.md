**“Rough Rider” by Steven Lee Adkins Jr.**

****Believe it or not, it has been 100 years since the great warrior Theodore Roosevelt died. Here are some of his words “Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with the poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat…

“Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

“It is not the critic who counts. Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man in the arena. Whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood. Who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again.

“ I know now that I would have turned from my wife’s deathbed to have answered the call.

“The stern and manly qualities which are essential to the well being of a masterful race.

“I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one.”
