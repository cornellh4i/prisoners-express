**A Blended World by Michael Lanning**

Hey, Jane, do you realize that just a few years ago, the moment a baby was born, either pink or blue ribbons, balloons, and blankets were displayed? Or when the police tried identifying a stranger, the unknown’s gender was the first piece of information given. Heck, even now with the older generation, you still see that primitive need to assign us to “his” or “her” gender slots. My grandma still asks when will I marry a boy and have kids? Yuck!

Wendy, you’re too young to know how bad it was. I grew up under an intense, even overwhelming, cultural pressure to gravitate not to other girls, but to marry boys. To be straight, in other words. I never understood how heterosexuality was natural if its the product of a powerfully enforced cultural and political domination. I never thought I would be able to see the day I can walk down the street hand-in-hand with my girlfriend and not be arrested, then assaulted by the same police who claim to protect and serve all life.

Yeah Jane, my dad has told me that it started back in the 60’s with the sexual confusion of long hair making boys look like girls. What an uproar it caused with conservative families. But religion got on board with the revelation that God has never been encumbered by the child’s genetically determined sexuality, that God is pleased that people have a kind and loving heart. The Christian world finally embraced the notion of masculine and feminine genders becoming fluid. In God’s eyes kindness and love are what life is all about.

Well, Wendy, of all creatures on earth, only human beings finally feel comfortable to deliberately blur gender distinctions. And who knows, maybe one day we will have a transgender for president!
