**“Young Performers–Future Leaders” by Mark Adam Peirano**

You know them as the presidents of the United States, George W. Bush and Donald J. Trump, but recent prep school yearbook photos from Andover, Massachusetts’s most elite boys’ school, have revealed a lighter side of the two from their formative years at their first boarding school. Pictured above are “Donnie” Trump, left, and “Whiskey” Bush, notes in the yearbook reveal.

The two are pictured here after a campus-wide program competition on interpretive dance. The yearbook’s article quotes the two competitors, who placed second overall and first in costume design. “Whiskey’s in charge of setting the pace, I just try to keep up and not lose my wig and mask…” (Trump). “I just think of it as square dancing with a jump rope, and the music does the rest” (Bush). The article describes the contestants’ chosen music as “disco inferno,” but there is no indication as to the theme, as the contest at the school was held long before “disco” became a popular music genre in the United States.

The producers of the PBS television magazine Frontline uncovered the yearbook photo and article as part of a future program set to air some time in the spring of 2020 on the controversial practices of dressing in “black face” that has plagued many politicians on both sides of the aisle. The program begins with a brief story on the late Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from Missouri, former governor Mel Carnahan, whose political campaign suffered setbacks after an image of himself as a college student painted with “black face” appeared in the news. Frontline sources say that they were prompted to cover the issue when three Virginia politicians, including the governor, lieutenant governor, and the state’s attorney general, were all touched by controversies when “black face” photos surfaced in the media there, but they never expected to find the “Interpretive Dance” contest photo of young Trump and Bush as a result of their inquiries.

Frontline sources indicate that although they do not match the “black face” criteria, this photo and two photos of Colin Powell and Jimmy Carter dressed in drag will be featured in the episode as examples of “interesting” photos of public figures in their youth. There has been no comments or tweets from Bush or Trump about their reaction to the inclusion of the yearbook photo on national television. Frontline will not confirm or deny that film footage of the contest has been found. “You’ll have to watch the episodes to see…” #fakenews
