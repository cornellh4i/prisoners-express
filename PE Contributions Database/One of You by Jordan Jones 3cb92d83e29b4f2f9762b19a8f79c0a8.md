**One of You by Jordan Jones**

What would it take to become one of you? A decision that would change us all, a decision that would reveal the heart of many. Who could remain loyal, and who’s love reaches only so deep?

Of course, I’m not speaking of you Jacinda (my big sis and best friend). You have always shown me love unconditionally, and been there when others turned away! Do you remember that time I confided in you? When I told you I would move states away and live out my impulses? You told me I better have you a room in waiting as tears filled both our eyes!

We both know, however, that you’re not the risk. It’s everyone else who’s the gamble. In family we should all be capable of no wrong; especially when we are following our heart. No matter where life takes me, our family should be supportive, right? But we know that’s not true in the Jones's family.

No, their love is determined by my actions and appearance. However strong the bonds of our lives thus far, my one choice could sever them forever! Irregardless of my future, things have changed Jacinda. The Jordan you know won’t be returning as he was. Seven long years detained with oppression at every turn meant I’ll either conform or stand for my liberation, and sis I’m proud to say I’m standing.

Damn it Julie, you hurt me the most. We were best friends as we grew up, and though you are younger, I’ve always admired you! Even as you rejected my truth. Did I always offend you by liking what you do? Each time I acted like your sister? Do I offend you now by acting as I do? Should I please you or live as I am?

I know these questions go unasked and your words go unspoken. We both have our own reasons for that, but honestly I believe you just don’t understand. It can be complicated and evasive Julie, but with love you could come to terms. I’m here to share when you’re ready; if that day comes.

At this point ladies, I’ve come too far to turn back. I’ve worked too hard to let anyone, (even you Julie), deny me now. Too long I’ve denied my place beside you, my sisters. I know you’ve seen the changes through the years. My hair grows longer and my skin becomes smoother. The day is coming when I have to choose between family and myself, and right now I don’t know what that choice will be. Will I sacrifice all of you to be all of me?

The truth is, the sheer majesty of you both drives me to envy. From the ways that you apply your makeup to the products you use in your hair. Don’t you notice how I recognize every change you make to your appearance? Hell, I even imitate the way that you apply your eyeliner. This isn’t a desire to be you, but could I be one of you?
