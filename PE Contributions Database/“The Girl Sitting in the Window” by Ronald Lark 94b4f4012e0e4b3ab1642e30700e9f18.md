**“The Girl Sitting in the Window” by Ronald Lark**

Outside looking in….

The world’s a big place. Parts of it are beautiful, others are ugly. There are parts of it that are vast, while there are other parts that are seemingly cramped. Parts of it are populated and civilized, and then there are those parts that have been lost in time.

The world’s a big place. There is so much out there. So many lands, so many peoples…all connected in one way or another, even when they are separated by water.

Yeah, the world’s a big place. So many lives beings lived. So many views of it all. Everyone with their own direction, their own part to play, creating a sense of life beyond their own.

Wow, the world’s a big place. It provides each of us opportunity each day in many different areas of life. There’s so much that can be done, and so much to see. The possibilities are endless.

The world’s a big place. Just imagine how many people are falling in love at this very moment, how many babies are being born, and, unfortunately, how many lives are passing. Think about how many people are just waking up, and how many have just fallen asleep. How many people are cooking, eating, walking, running, working, etc…?
