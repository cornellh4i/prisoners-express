**“Excuse Me Miss Beautiful” by Master Nkrumah Lumumba Valier**

Excuse me Miss Beautiful

Do you mind if I sit down at this table with you?

I know that a woman as beautiful as you are

Already has a man in your life that loves you.

And I know he spoils you,

With all the good things in life a Queen deserves.

I am so rude.

Please let me introduce myself to you

My name is Nkrumah Lumumba Valier.

And I was just wondering,

What your name could be?

Miss, can I buy you a drink?

Or would you prefer a bottle of your favorite drink?

When I seen you sitting here all alone

And then we made eye contact, your beautiful green eyes.

Cast a spell over me

And that spell

brought me to this table.

Now that I know you exist my life would not be the same

If you didn’t exist in my life...

What am I saying?

Is it is something about you

That makes me want to place my heart on the table and give it to you?
