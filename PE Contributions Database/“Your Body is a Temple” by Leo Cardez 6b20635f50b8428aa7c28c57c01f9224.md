**“Your Body is a Temple” by Leo Cardez**

*This article is meant for those that need to lose at least 30 lbs

“Men who carry excess belly fat could gain an inch of penis length by losing a significant amount of weight (30+lbs).”

- Dr. Ro (EBONY, October/November 2018)

Wow! As if we needed another reason to lose our gut? Are you ready to get serious about losing weight? Ready to do the hard work necessary? If you’re not 100% committed, go back to your honey bun. If you are, keep reading.

The good news is we’ve already done the hardest part: come to prison. Believe it or not, prison is the best place we could have to truly shock our system and change our diet habits. We lack the luxury of choices. We’re on a forced diet - we have to make an effort (and spend money) to reach the calorie intake an average American consumes daily. The seemingly tiny portions and bland food served by the state and federal prison sysetms will not kill us (contrary to popular belief) and does provide just enough nutrition and calories to sustain life - and coincidentally the ideal amount to spur significant weight loss (for those close to the obese marker on the Body Mass Index).

Part 1 of your weight loss program was 5 steps:

1. Empty your box of all food and drinks. Stop buying any.
2. Eat all and only state food:
- All 3 meals
- No bread
- No processed sugar - trade those cookies for extra veggies or fruit.
- Drink plenty of water - shoot for half of your body weight in ounces.
1. Light exercise
- Walk/run/play sports at yard and gym 3 times a week
- Basic body weight exercises 3 times a week
1. Sleep; steady, consistent, 7-9 hours a day
2. Watch the pounds melt off - up to 20 lbs in your first month (depending on your starting weight)

Part 2: Keeping it off. Like recidivism, most folks will regain all of the lost weight within 6 months. Keeping the weight off is actually the hardest part of any weight loss strategy (and yet most diets don’t account for it). Follow these steps to assure your success:

1. Identify all the truly healthy items on your canteen/commissary list.
- Read nutritional labels, pay close attention to serving size; fat, sugar, sodium, carbs, and calorie content versus protein and fiber content). [Spoiler alert: oatmeal, peanut butter, and cereal aren't as good for you as you may think]
- Only shop from this approved list
1. Create and keep a diet journal. Plan and track everything we eat and drink daily.
2. Water is best for us, but we can start drinking tea and coffee (no sugar, but milk is okay). Absolutely no pop/soda or Kool-Aid.
3. Begin a consistent weight training and cardio regimen 3 times a week each.
4. Never eat after 7pm. Never.
5. Eat all meals within a 12 hour window (if possible)
6. Always eat breakfast, the bigger the better/
7. Take available supplements or vitamins (the science is still out, but hey, it’s a cheap insurance policy). Take with food.
8. Reward/cheat meals and snacks from our healthy diet list can be incorporated into our diet when we skip a chow, celebrate a milestone, or merely need something different. No more than 3 times a week.
9. Grow a bigger dick.

This effort is by no means easy, but nothing worthwhile is. We’re not only building better, healthier, habits we’re also building character, self-control, and self-esteem. Congrats, if you’ve made it, you’re a better, thinner, healthier man… with a huge cock.
