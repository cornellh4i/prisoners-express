**“Apologies” by Cesar Hernandez**

Not too long ago I finally came to the realization that apologies are very important. Even if the apology is only one way it’s still important. For a long time I thought it was good to forgive others if they would not forgive me as well.

I came to the point where it is better to forgive others and move on with my life. If a person does not forgive me, it is no longer on me. It is on that person. If they forgive me or not, it is between them and God. I cannot force someone to forgive me. All I can do is forgive that person and move on. I don’t have to think about that person anymore because I already forgave them. By forgiving someone you get rid of a lot of stress and that is one less thing to think about.
