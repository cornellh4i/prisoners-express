**“Still Here” by Scott A. Madoulet**

At 46 years old, divorced, relapsing, hiding the full extent of my sickness, in the midst of a weeks-long binge, suffering from self-loathing and severe depression, I intravenously injected one full grain of cocaine into my aim. This resulted in a 25-minute long grand-mal seizure and an out-of-body experience that I will never, ever forget.

As I desperately clung to the nearest piece of reality, a closet door, to keep from falling, the seizure increased in intensity. As my arms uncontrollably jerked back and forth, I repeatedly smashed the edge of the solid oak door into my face. At the same time, I became dissociated from my body. I felt this great calm and began seeing myself from above myself, watching as I finally released the door, fell to the ground, and flopped like a fish on hot dock boards, doing the herky-jerk on the hallway floor.

Once the seizure stopped, I tried to raise my head and get up－ you see, I wasn’t afraid or even concerned－ I still felt calm. But the tremors started again, so I dragged and slithered my way to the front room and crawled up onto the couch. After a few minutes, I had a smoke. After that, I got up and had a beer from the fridge. I swore off coke, at least until the next time. I never did go to the doctors.

Ironically, one year later, I experienced this some out-of-body sensation. Although I felt nothing, I became disassociated from myself. Drug free but under extreme emotional duress, it was as if I was again outside, my body, looking down on the sentencing I was receiving. Head hung low, I watched the drama unfold. With my back to the audience, I witnessed the hate and smug satisfaction of my accusers. I deserved this. I did, and I do.

I’m still here, but I’m different now. Six years down on 15, I’ve earned my Associates Degree, taken some programming, and am working to pay off my LFO’s. Somehow, I’ve found that calm again again. It’s alright here, you know!?!
