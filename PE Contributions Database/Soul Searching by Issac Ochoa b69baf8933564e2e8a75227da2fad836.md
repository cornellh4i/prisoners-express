***Soul Searching* by Issac Ochoa**

I have never known fear so gripping until this moment when our eyes met. I stand here, motionless, a statue in nature’s garden, my breath held like a secret. Is the wind it’s ally directing my scent to this animal who together would seek to expel me by fear or force from this frontier? What am I doing here anyways? What am I trying to prove? Have I lost my mind? Sometimes the hardest questions aren’t really questions at all.

I live in Los Angeles where I made my living as artist. Made a living? I was one of those one-hit-wonders whose only claim to fame was a gallery showing. That bordered on the pathetic, with one actual sale that I surmised was a pity purchase, slightly tipping the balance of self respect in my favor. “Congratulations” I was lied to, “you were a success.” I was given that obligatory spiel, that pep talk disingenuously provided as a reminder to keep you head up, you’ll get’em next time, attaboy. Fucking loser! $300 for my painting. Passion doesn’t pay well these days.

I wasn’t as upset by that ordeal as you might imagine or expect, but I was confronted by it’s testament that people don’t know shit about art. When they don’t understand they misinterpret: “it’s a perfect circle” says one, “No no no, it’s much more than that. It symbolized the cycle of life. Continuity in the highest form,” says the other. Idiots! It’s simply the letter O. My last name begins with the letter O. See what I mean? Anyways I soon came to the conclusion that the stroke of the brush wasn’t adequately supporting my food habit so I decided to trade in my leisure for a 10-6 graveyard shift at a warehouse distribution hub. I worked all night and slept all day pulling overtime when I could. My hours were the only thing of monetary value and so I sold them without shame. Soon afterward, I became despondent. No one ever really notices that cardboard has a smell to it and let me tell you, when that reality sinks in, you can’t help but feel you’ve fallen from some pinnacle where your life was a fragrance worth bottling. I became like a tree in winter, stripped bare of it’s glory and can’t stand to be looked at. Standing there in a world so cold I needed a break before I myself broke. So I cashed in my meager savings at the bank for some of my hours back deciding to take some time off to do some soul searching. Hmm, where does one find one’s soul? I hadn’t a clue. But, since it was winter and raining I figured what the hell, water is more tolerable when it’s frozen.

Suddenly I am snapped out of my reverie by a blast of frigid air and return to the present moment where I am still engaged in this epic stand-off between beast and man. It is too prideful to give way, though I can’t help but wonder why it hadn’t yet made a move. Not a snarl nor a raised tail. No offensive or defensive stance to confront me with. It seems the primordial instinct, that nature of the beast, it’s essence of being too long been in a state of decay. But then it struck me at the particular moment that this animal may very well be more afraid of me than I of it. Maybe there is a paralyzing fear that grips it too.

I can’t help but to be drawn to this hallowed entity in front of me. If I was oblivious to my own consciousness I would swear that this figure in my very own shadow is standing there shitless. For I too seem to have lost my essence, that nature of my calling. I too am uncertain of what I am anymore.

Desperation is an odd thing. It sniffs you out and sometimes stalks you like prey before you realize it is staring you in the face, waiting for you to make your move. It confronts us with this fight or flight approach at times when we least expect it and we are forced to make decisions to either play dead or play the hunter, chasing ambitions, passion, and purpose until they’re captured.

Courage, I now realize, is it’s natural enemy. It was in this moment of epiphany that the animal broke the look between us and looked around, nose to the wind as it perhaps seeking out some other poor fool in search of himself amidst a mountain in the middle of winter.

And just like that, it is gone.
