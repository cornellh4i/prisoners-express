**“Couple at Table” by Dr. Victor Andrew Apodaca**

There I sit, one year from now, to woo a pretty little young gal. I sit smiling because I am unsure, I am old and down another brew. Boy’s she’s too pretty to be with an old convict like me. It’s time we’ll spend to have a good looking lady in toe after 18 years in a hole with (4) four concrete 2nd steel walls gray and dark; no sunlight to show, wow I’m happy I made it out alive. Now I have someone on my side to chit chat away. The old harridan women I called Lady Luck has done me a good deed. She sat me down for those 18 years of ugly gray walls to look on a gal with dark brown skin, tight with a color of bright color makeup. She sure is a sore sight to the gray hell I lived in and tortures untold now. I’m smiling at my lady trying to hide my pain and shame of what I’d done to stay alive in the devil’s butcher shop. The yawls,the yells and the bad smells wow you made it and you still have some time before death comes a knocking saying it time to pay your debt. No time for questions of any kind, ‘no’ begging can I have a little more time but today is a good day. I recall on that day the gal at the bar with the wave of curls and the big smile gave my last breath with a smile of ‘at least I didn’t die in that stinking old pen….’
