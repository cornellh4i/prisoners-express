**“The Banana Pudding Party” by Matthew Tomlinson**

PART ONE: At The Establishment

For the purposes of our story, call the place The Establishment. That cloaks it with anonymity. If you need the cheapest place in all of Houston to stay, consider The Establishment. On the ground floor alcove there’s a liquor store at left paired with a bail bondsman on your right. There’s an unmarked door straight ahead. Go straight. (It’s rare that you go straight, huh?) The unmarked blue door opens to a vestibule. Turn right to climb the open staircase to the landing. Come around and turn left to climb the next flight of stairs. On the second floor is a podium. That’s The Establishment.

Walrus will be waiting. Russell Wall heard you coming up, and those stairs go nowhere else. If you’ve got $28.50 then Walrus has a 9x12 feet room for you. Checkout is noon sharp. Bathrooms are at the end of the hall. But if you’ve got $142.50 then the room is yours for seven days. It was that kind of place.

The hallway of The Establishment is not wide. Two people can pass if one is not obese and if the other is kind enough to squish sideways. Walrus had seen me. Closed-circuit television identified me as a weekly tenant returning at 1810 hours with two sacks of groceries. The podium was vacant. Down the hallway to my right were twelve rooms. The climb up the stairs had jostled my bladder beyond its limits. The bags were left by my door as quickening steps took me down the hall. Tinker, in the room catty-cornered to mine, had left her door ajar, as you saw in the Prisoner Express September 2018 photo. (My mailroom delayed my story. PE didn’t receive it in time to print. Can I get a rowdy “Amen!” on that?) “Tinker, set the bottle down, girl.” I continued on my urgent mission.

Nobody had availed themselves of the bananas poking provocatively out of my right sack. My door was left invitingly half-open while the food was unloaded.

Tinker called: “Are you making banana pudding?”

“No. They were on sale.”

“Then may I have a banana?”

“Sure. Come pick the one you like best.”	The door of my next-door neighbor pivoted with a grating, discordant squeal. “Tinker? Who has bananas?”

“Me. Tee Dee. Come pick yours, Butterfly.”

Tinker had popped loose her afternoon snack. She held a bright yellow banana in one hand with a brown bottle in the other. Those might be the only nourishment of her day. The far-too-slender Puerto Rican rounded the corner. Butterfly patted the aging alcoholic on the shoulder. “I heard you ask about banana pudding. My taste buds decided a banana was what they want.” Butterfly snapped loose her treat. “You got vanilla wafers?”

“I’m a registered cookie monster. Then the bananas were on sale since they’re already ripe.” I shrugged. “Coincidence. That’s all. Coincidence.”

“Oh yeah?” Butterfly rummaged through the sack. “Let me find some canned milk in here and I’ll know something, huh?”

“Oh yeah? Got something on yer mind? You can find what you’re looking for, y’know? Canned milk is in the middle drawer of the filing cabinet. So what? You wanna make something out of all that? Huh?”

Tinker took a seat on my bed. “Banana pudding would be delicious. I’ve got sandwich meat. We’ll have chopped ham sandwiches for supper and banana pudding for dessert. It’s Friday. Let’s celebrate.”

My cell phone was produced. “I could afford to have a big pizza delivered. It’s Friday. Let’s celebrate.”	Butterfly pushed two empty pitchers against my chest. I took these to the end of the hall for water. From the bathroom it was easy to hear the quiet rhythms of soft jazz from Tinker’s collection. My folding card table had been set up. Tinker was slicing bananas. Butterfly smiled while taking the water from me. She handed me a glass mug of Dr. Pepper on the rocks. “We’re having a Banana Pudding Party so Tinker shared some rum. It’s Friday.”

A cautious sip proved Butterfly had gone very light on the rum. She knew my limits. “Thanks. Just right. Just perfect for a Friday night Banana Pudding Party.”

“We went through your cabinet,” Tinker explained. The standard five-drawer filing cabinet served as pantry, kitchen drawers, and cookware storage. “You’ve got green beans. I have instant potatoes. Butterfly has mixed vegetables. We could microwave that for supper. Then you could go to the store on Main Street for some fried chicken, if you would.”

“I would.” We three did this regularly. During my prison years, we called this making a spread. “Fried chicken, potatoes, mixed vegetables, green beans, and banana pudding for dessert. That’s a Friday night feast.”

And so that Friday night was. The store on Main Street provided ten pieces of fried chicken. My neighbors filled out our plates with mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and green beans. Over-the-air broadcast television entertained us. What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? Life in The Establishment inspires a sense of community to answer those questions. We three could lend each other a helping hand to do more, with whatever we had, than any of us could do solitarily. Blessings, like bananas on sale, could be the catalyst for a logarithmic progression, like banana pudding then onward to a spread for supper. What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now?

END OF PART ONE

PART TWO: Locked In Segregation

What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? I wrote this for the September 2018 photo theme. But Geneta Glenn, in the mailroom of Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit of Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), delayed my mail. Prisoner Express didn’t get this story in time to print. So what can I do? I can rewrite this for the July 2019 Word Cue “Helping Hand.” I can mail it June 03, 2019 Monday so Prisoner Express will get it in time. You’ll still enjoy this story 10 months late.

What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? We have 136 prisoners on India Pod. Beef Noodle Casserole came at 1415 hours for segregation supper. Segregation breakfast was due 13 hours later. They might bring pancakes. They might bring one boiled egg with a peanut butter sandwich, a 0300 hours Johnny Bag. Those of us blessed with commissary would do all right with a spread. Those without commissary would do the best they could.

Many of us in this High Security building know a trick. Guards use an iron crowbar to open the food slot. They insert the bar into the locking mechanism, pry the locking pin up, and then (unless they’re too light in the ass) my food slot drops from vertical to horizontal. Many of us can open the food slot with no crow bar, from inside. Never mind how. Just accept that we do it.

Guards change every 12 hours. At 1730 hours Day Shift swaps with Night Shift. Twelve hours is a long stretch (but not as long as my 99 years), so India Pod guards leave at 1700 hours to turn in their gear. Night Shift has a Turn Out Meeting prior to coming to India Pod. It’s 1800 hours before the properly turned-out Night Shift limps in. For an hour, ain’t nobody here but us chickenheads.

You’ll know what time it is by the noise. WHUMP! That’s a brogan boot kicking the food slot. WHUMP! WHUMP! Soon comes KER-CLANG! of the first food slot popping open. “Get out there, Road Dog! I’m waiting fer ya!”

WHUMP! WHUMP! Road Dog had trouble getting out there.

Matthew 12:34 applies. Jesus said: “O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.”

Home Boy put his mouth at the food slot to encourage his consort. “Whassa matter, Road Dog? Ya didn’t eat your Cheerios? Ya ate what? Ya ate yer cellie?”

Whump-whump-WHUMP! Road Dog was doing the best he could with what he had.

“That’s right, Road Dog. Get freaky with it, ya old freak!” cheered Home Boy.

WHUMP! KER-CLANG! Road Dog put his mouth at his food slot to yell: “Naw, Home Boy, I didn’t eat my Cheerios. I ate Wheaties. They take longer to work. Whatcha cookin? I got a meat pouch, some peppers, and some soups. Hey, ya want this banana pudding from lunch?”

Home Boy had tossed his string in front of Road Dog’s cell. “Oh hell yeah! Why didn’t you eat it? You really, really like bananas.”

“Too much sugar hurts my teeth.” Road Dog had already tied the items onto the fishing line.

“Sugar don’t hurt my teeth. I brush them.”

“You ain’t got no teeth no more. The dentist took your teeth out when he put that I.U.D. in your tonsils.”

So what’s the difference between an I.E.D. and an I.U.D.? An Improvised Explosive Device blows *you* up. An Intra-Uterine Device keeps *her* from getting “blown up.”

There were echoes of WHUMP! WHUMP! KER-CLANG! as other slots popped open. What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? Life in High Security India Pod inspires a level of community to answer those questions. Neither Road Dog nor his cellie had hot pots. Both Home Boy and his cellie had hot pots. Home Boy used both to cook. So it takes cooperation. It takes skills at transporting items through the locked doors of High Security India Pod. Given those things, four men could share a hot spread to tide their bellies over for 9 more hours until breakfast.

So what’s a spread? As noted, there are 13 hours between supper and breakfast. Think of 1930 and those Great Depression Years. What did vagrants eat? The trite caricature said one hobo (with a “b,” not an “m”) might bring potatoes, another might bring green beans, and so a community might huddle around a fire to create a stew. A spread is similar. Whatcha got to put in the pot?

What can you do, with whatever you’ve got, wherever you are, right now? Maybe you’re locked in the India Pod with a cellie who doesn’t make commissary. Break bread. When you had a job, the government took taxes from your check. Break bread with your broke cellie. Call it the Broke Cellie Tax. In TDCJ, we got dessert once a week. Road Dog could’ve eaten that dessert. He sent it to Home Boy because was doing the cooking work. Maybe you, too, could use banana pudding to say: “Appreciate that, Home Boy!”

Yeah, if you look then you’ll see. The July 2019 Word Cue of “Helping Hand” helped you recognize that even in prison you can be or get a little help. Look back at the September 2018 Photo Cue showing the woman lying down with the bottle in her hand. You didn’t recognize Tinker. You didn’t know she’s a jazz fan with a taste for banana pudding. You never thought of what help Tinker and Butterfly could be for Tee Dee’s spread. Who around you can get or be an unexpected “Helping Hand?” (I didn’t say “deserves.”) If you look, then you’ll see.

Geneta Glenn delayed my mail. I redrafted these stories, much better. That’s a “Helping Hand.”
