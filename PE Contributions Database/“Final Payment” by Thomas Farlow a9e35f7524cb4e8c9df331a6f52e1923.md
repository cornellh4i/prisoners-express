**“Final Payment” by Thomas Farlow**

He always came to take. It was never to give, because it was all he knew: The Taking. Yet, if He did give, He added by subtraction. Poetic prose at a formal, somber gathering. The appearance of dishes by way of neighbors and friends in that vain attempt of human expression to replace the irreplaceable. But mostly, he left a look in their eyes of pity, contemplation, and finally succumbing to the inevitable suspicion and fear.

He came to her more than others, it seemed, and for that, they began to keep a distance between her and them. Somehow, they had placed her as the center of the maelstrom He wrought, as if she had some hand in the matter of Him and his whims. That was the most frustrating of all the maladies that followed in His wake: the Mantle of Blame they draped over her merely by association. Damn Him for His hand.

He first came for Paw-Paw. She still remembered the white whiskers roughing her face when she smothered Paw-Paw in hugs. The mint and cloves of his talc that embedded them into His skin always calmed her as she fell asleep in his arms. The way he could make the characters in a story appear in her mind with His voice, a rumble of gravel that demanded attention and promised reassurances. He, the great thief, stole him from her. That was the first of two she harbored deep within a deep resentment that festered and roiled under the surface.

He came other times. He came for Uncle Stanley and his goofy gags and bad jokes. He came to her two brothers, Chad and Brady, and their often misguided protection of her. He came for Grandpa Joes, the one who taught her to never be afraid of stepping forward.

He came one other time to exact His highest toll yet.

Then, there’s today. Today, He’ll come down stealthier avenues. Today, His price will be her freedom.

Everything He has touched, He has taken from her. As she stands there, dressed for an occasion of joy, she can only think of her grief. The mark He left burns deeper than it ever has in years. For that, more than anything else, she has chosen to wear black.

The day should have been marked white. It was her wedding day. As she stood in the small vestibule with her best friend dressed in her maid-of-honor dress, despite the cramped quarters of the small room, it felt way too empty.

He had taken the one thing that meant the world to her on this day before all others: her father. Two years ago, Death visited her father in his study as he read one of his new stories to her. She was always the first to hear them before others, a privilege she cherished to the very end. She felt Him even before the event. A cold chill that tiptoed up her legs till it settled into the back of her spine. It rode up the vertebrae into a crescendo when Dad collapsed mid-sentence. A stroke, the doctors said. A massive explosion inside the cranium of blood and synaptic energy. And somehow, she felt it all along with him as he died in her arms.

And now, the extent of that theft was felt inside these wooden walls of this tiny space. There would be no one to walk her down the aisle. There would be no one to raise her veil, kiss her cheek, and hand her off to the man who would be hers, and she his. A day when her singleness would enter its own form of death, there would be no father to mediate the transition.

There would be looks and questioning flames from the pews today. Of course there will be. They would wonder: would Death visit her again to see this new man, would her curse continue forth? She understood their rumor mongering - a natural human tendency feeding a deep need to attain clearer understanding. But, it didn’t mean she had to like it.

She wouldn’t let Death have this day any more than He already had. If she did, it would have her too.

A stamp of her foot in emphatic assertion of the silent statement was unsurprisingly followed by the start of “The Bridal March” from inside the abbey. It was time. She steeled herself, smoothed down the wrinkles that came about from fidgeting, and let Marsha lead the way. Life anew awaited ahead.
