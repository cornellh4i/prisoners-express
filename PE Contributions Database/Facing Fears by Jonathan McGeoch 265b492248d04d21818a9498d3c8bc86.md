Fear is a feeling that can paralyze, a feeling that can overwhelm. We can become frozen or we can overreact. Fear can involve the unknown, or even worse, the known. To stay calm in the face of fear, to accept that fear is natural and then to harness it to get through the situation as well as possible. This is what I strive to do. We all have a greatest fear or a time that stands out. But to me, it is the everyday fears and how we react that make us a better person… or a worse person? To me, the ability to step up and accept the challenge that is posed by our everyday fears will help us grow and mature. We can all run away. We can all freeze up, but very few of us can consistently face fear by looking it in the eyes and making whatever it is that we fear back down. Do I do this every time? No. Do I try? Sometimes. Do I have room to improve? Of course. Let’s see what I can do.
