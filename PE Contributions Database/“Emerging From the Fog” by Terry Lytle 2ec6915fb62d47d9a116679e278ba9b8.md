**“Emerging From the Fog” by Terry Lytle**

****Emerging from the fog… but I am here. Like a child, escaping the womb- its safety, its serenity- I, too, become… like the radiant light of the riderless motorcycle- or one headlight of the Wallflowers song playing in my head; I, too, emerge… from the fog.

As the fog of wasted time and wasted years unsettles me… my mind emerges from the fog: hot water on the left, cold on the right, shit doesn’t run uphill; idle-tach, about 795 RPMs; 29-35, bond-line for shingles, cutting every other tab for a 1-inch overhang; stud-nails, 16-centered; plywood nail-off, 8-penny nails; drywall screw-off, 1-inch phillips-head screws; black ink, Bic pen… paper, unknown… words, undecipherable. Unseen.

I emerge, as the world- “free society”- is my home… stealing, done; drugs, no longer the outlet I run to… And still I write, like a fisherman on a paddleless boat… adrift on the after-storm of calmed seas, his oil lantern in hand- something like a Led Zeppelin album cover- dissecting the fog, like a knife long-slicing a pickle or summer sausage, that we buy… from the commissary- canteen; no miserable ill-repute, I.

The fog…a 4-year, 8-month, and 10-day old daughter: now, 15 years young, my nieces and nephews-a  little older than tikes themselves- now with children of their own. Houses, sold; woods and tobacco fields, demolished: households and shopping stores, stand where they once stood… them, too, emerging from the fog.

Just as pen and paper create what your eyes see, my mind is adrift at what’s been seen… brutalism, abrasiveness, hatred and scheme: even a system disregards their rules and policies that “procedure” me. Women: my eyes have bled, corroded with Fog’s rust. Money- the printed kind- my comprehension is still the same: it is the root of this evil, drug user-prison game… passage of Time. Fog, the screen… of lust.

I lie, idle… blinded by the fog of not procreating, not tillething my land. But, I stand… everything laid out before me…

The fog buries everything that’s behind. No idle memory, mind. Emerging from...I.
