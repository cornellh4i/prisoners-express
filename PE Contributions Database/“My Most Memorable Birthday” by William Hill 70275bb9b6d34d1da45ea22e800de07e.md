**“My Most Memorable Birthday” by William Hill**

Unlike many children, I did not have organized birthday parties growing up. This wasn’t because of religious or cultural reasons, rather it was because my family did not have the finances to be able to provide such festivities. However, my parents and siblings always made sure that I received a few presents each year. Best of all, my mom would make a pecan pie for me too. Mom’s homemade pecan pie is still my favorite dessert. Birthdays were more of a family affair than a soiree with friends from school. This was okay with me as I did not have many friends because my family lived in an isolated area of the county with few kids my age.

This changed when we moved from the tiny farming community of Mount Vernon of rural northeast Texas to the slightly larger farming community of Sulphur Springs. While our new home was in an area just as isolated as our former home, there were several other nearby families that had kids my age. Though we didn’t all become best friends, we grew to enjoy each other’s company.

My birthday is in October and as the days dwindled down to my 11th birthday I was anticipating another one of Mom’s fantastic pecan pies. Finally, the big day came and there was the usual routine of getting out of bed and watching cartoons while eating Frosted Flakes cereal, the kind with so much sugar it energized you for the rest of the day.

I was preparing to go outside and play when dad announced that we would be going to town. This may not sound like much to you, but it was big news in my eleven-year-old world. I don’t want to make it seem like I lived on the set of *Little House on the Prairie* but dad only went to town every Friday, when he got paid. Only on Fridays would he and mom go to town to pay bills, buy groceries, and take care of whatever other business they had.

My brother Nolan and I piled into the back of dad’s pickup truck, back when this was legal, and headed into town. On the way into town we stopped at my best friend Buddy Sutton’s house and picked him up also. We also stopped to pick up my friend Yancy and his sister Shanna. All the way into town the only thing anyone said to me was “Happy Birthday.” In the words of Alice in *Through the Looking Glass* this entire situation was getting curiouser and curiouser.

Finally, we pulled into the parking lot of the local Ken’s Pizza and saw the rest of my friends from school and church arriving. What a strange coincidence, I thought at the time--hey give me a break, I was only eleven years old.

Mom and dad had planned a birthday pizza party at the restaurant. Also invited was another neighbor Lara Coke, who would become my very first girlfriend. My oldest brother and two sisters who no longer lived at home also came. My sister Pam and her husband Doug drove all the way from their home in Irving Texas to be there too.

It was a great party and I believe that we all had a great time--I know that I did! There was pizza galore, games, and I got a lot of cool gifts too. The people who worked at the restaurant even sang “Happy Birthday” to me.

They say that all good things come to an end and eventually it was true, in the case of the party. As much as I would have been content to stay in that moment for a lot longer, ultimately my friends and their families had to leave. It had been a very enjoyable birthday, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed, not because of the pizza and presents, but because I had been able to share it with the people that I loved.

When I got home I went about doing the same things that I did every Saturday. I played and I did my chores, and come suppertime I had one more surprise waiting for me: Mom had not forgotten about the pecan pie! Now, this day went from being very memorable to being my most memorable birthday ever.
