**Brotherly Love by Juan Delgado**

An hour to think, too much to drink. In the couch with my brothers connected like a chain in links, but the picture is clear, bond so strong without fear. To feel that warm embrace of a hug, nothing as special as brotherly love. Without remorse or regrets, but precious memories to never forget, the years that past, the hatred, the flights, the laughs are all part of nature’s changes to evolve and grow. To the people we now mom’s cooking coming out of the stove, and my brotherly love to hold.
