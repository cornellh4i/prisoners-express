Suicide Rock is a very high rock with jagged edges and high ruts, and it is very slippery. I was 13 in a small town called Coffee Creek, population 150, in the state of California.

Peer pressure made me climb this rock. It wasn’t hard to climb, but it was hard to get down: you had to jump to get down. To jump, you had to run on the rock and make sure your jump was a reach. Below there were rocks waiting to snag or dismember you. This was my first time, and so I walked back very slowly. Instead of just jumping, I wanted to impress my girlfriend Brittney. So I ran, did a front flip, slipped on a rock below, hit my toe on something, and in all this motion, I couldn’t stop. The momentum literally made me do a front flip again. This time, I landed in the water. I noticed half of my toe was cut off on the top--a nice slice. A quarter of my big toe on the right foot was hanging off the side like a chunk of meat. I ripped my shirt and tie my toe skin back together. I’m on an elevated mountain, 12,000 feet above sea level. The water is still pretty cold, like 40-50 degrees F. So my toe was cold, numb and throbbing, but I was still okay.

The river flowed on, passing dad’s RV and trailer as well. So I took a nice, scary 10 minute ride to my house. I took the leap of faith and made it off Suicide Rock. After that incident, I wasn’t really interested in Suicide Rock anymore. I stayed far away, but yet I still wonder how mnay have died due to a fun thrill of adrenaline.
