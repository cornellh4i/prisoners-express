**“Island Trapped but Heaven Bound” by Steven Adam Miguel Umholtz**

I built my sea trapped cottage on a hill between two trees.

At night I lay upon its roof, stargaze and feel the breeze!

By day I watch the ships roll by right here from my front yard,

where I fish and swim, then take a bath. This life, it’s not so hard.

I bow and pray to start each day with a hot meal on my plate.

For the fish I caught the day before, this is their final fate!

The birds fly here from far and wide to use my trees for rest.

I love to hear them sing their songs, that beauty is the best.

This sea is really mighty. Sometimes I hear it roar.

That’s when I hide inside my little house, I even bolt the door.

Then, right before the storm goes by and the sea gets clear as glass…

I pray to God, get peace of mind, he makes my worries pass!

When your life is like my island, with days like a raging sea,

confess your sins to Jesus and he will set you Free!
