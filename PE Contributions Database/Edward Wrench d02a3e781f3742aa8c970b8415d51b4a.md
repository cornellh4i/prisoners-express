**by Edward Wrench**

I’m reminded of a campout at the French Creek State Park in Elverson, PA. At the mental health camp out where people with disabilities are able to go without being laughed at, I paid my $12 to go camping. In the summer, I talked to a staff at the drop in center in Pheonixville, PA. Mrs. Evans was the one picking me up at the group home on Paradise St. in Pheonixville, and we all got to the camp. It is bad luck to walk alone: I was chased up the hill I think by a Buffalo or it could have been the Jersey devil. It chased me past someone, but I was not wearing any underclothes. I ran into a shower, but I was not alone. As I got close, I tried the door but then ran outside with nothing on. A lot of people were staring at me as I came out of the shower. I got served by almost everyone. They all laughed at me, and I was laughing so hard I pissed myself in front of people. I said, “They got me with that bull trick.” It was a costume, and I still don’t know who got me. It was all good because I said I will get my pay back. Next time, I did: I got some friends to put tickets on all of the camper’s beds like they got served. I can’t tell you what my friends did, but I will know if I could do it all again. I would have glued all of their underwear together and put it in a tree as an underwear flag. I won’t actually do that because someone did it to me, and two wrongs don’t make a right.

God bless you all.
