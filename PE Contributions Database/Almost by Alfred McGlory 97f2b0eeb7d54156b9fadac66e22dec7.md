**Almost By Alfred McGlory**

One time I almost dated this real pretty girl named Lisa. She really liked me until this guy named Devin came into the picture. I must admit he did have swagger. We were sixteen back then. When I was nineteen years old, I almost went to jail for having sex with my neighbor’s daughter. She was sixteen and white and I’m black and back then that was a problem. Although I took all the blame, the truth is that it was her who was turning me out.

Almost every time I think of my mother, tears come to my eyes. She died January 2009. There are so many things I wish I told her. I wish I could have been a better son to her. But almost ain’t good enough.

My mother almost killed my father in 1978. She stabbed him twice and shot him---she was tired of the beating. Daddy would come in late and be real drunk and would pick fights with momma. My sisters and I were too little to do anything, so we would hide under the table and cry.

I almost decided not to send this theme in because I almost always feel that I’m no good at writing, but I have a desire to be a writer almost every time I write. My dream is to write at least one book, but the trouble is finding a publisher in prison. I’m tired of “almosts.”
