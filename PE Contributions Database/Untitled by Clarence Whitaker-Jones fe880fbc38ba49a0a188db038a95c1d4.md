A wolf is known not to look in a human’s eye unless he is going to kill him or her. So you have a option to leave this creature alone to his business of being a predator to prey. Majority of hunters trap this animal for secular material items. Unless you have no other means of finance of food than it’s exceptional. To those who are on the contrary and greedy don’t be shocked if you’re looking at this savage beast from the spiritual realm. Nobody cares when a fox dies. Why do we cry when a human dies? That fox has a family too. He has to eat too. Until you invaded that fox territory you were safe to roam. How would you like it is somebody invades your living quarters? Do a fox come howling at your doorsteps. When it’s icy cold you can mere expect survival or the wittiest when there is a scarcity of food.

Another sense I get from this fox picture is our human nature of starring in the eyes. A fox won’t look you in the eyes unless you’re prey. We as humans look each other in the eye forcefully to meet status quo. Look a man in his eyes and your telling the truth. That’s just an opinion I like to see with my mind’s picture. When I look someone in the eyes I get distracted by holding this stare to look in the speaker’s soul. You can’t tell if someone is being honest by looking in his eyes. I focus better in a conversation if I bow my head and let my ears watch his eyes. I can grasp more information with this posture. Bowing my head with my ear in his clear view. You feel more comfortable when you whisper in somebody’s ear instead of telling it face to face. If you can follow my words instead of my wolf eyes then you’ll pay attention.
