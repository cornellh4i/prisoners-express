The topic of fitting in can cover many grounds; so let me take you on a very insightful journey on why fitting in does not work in the long run. Let's go back to the time of Jesus Christ. All he had to do was say and act the way that everyone else did, and they would not have done what they did to him. But Jesus knew fitting in was not the way to go, because fitting in never works. Jesus knew this... the opposite of fitting in is staying true to yourself because if you are not real with yourself, who will be? It never worked for me, because as an African American, fitting in means giving up a lot of my identity and as that goes it's work in itself! Fitting in can only work on those individuals that have given up on not fitting in...or, better yet, fitting in really boils down to an individual lack of self worth for oneself!
