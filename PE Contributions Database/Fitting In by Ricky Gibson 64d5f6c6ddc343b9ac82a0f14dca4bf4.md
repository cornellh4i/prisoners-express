Throughout our lives, we encounter many situations where we want to be accepted by our peers, and to be accepted by the "In-Crowd." We, at times, have to go outside our character. This can be good, but there are always those that go against what our parents taught us. I can remember a time in eighth grade when I was the new student in a new school. There was a group of "Preps" (the higher class) that I just wanted to make an impression on, and I set out to do just that. I would be the Dare Devil and brave kid. Then, when I thought I was the "cool kid" and had a group of friends that cared, boy was I the fool. The challenges these "In-Crowd" kids ended up just making me a fool. I eventually was caught up in drugs and alcohol and skipping school on a regular basis, and that ended in a belt across my butt and more rules by my parents that only led to a rebellion from all authority. Not that I blame anyone for my faults. Just the realization of the downfalls experienced by wanting to fit in with the cool kids was one that, if I could do again, I would.

To everyone's small challenges that we all have to experience at one time or another, I say this: do what you feel is right and never take it so far that you'll regret it. The minute you get caught up in the feeling of approval, and someone comes up to announce the acts of such feats that you thought were cool, you'll see that they were really very stupid and could cost a lot in the long run.

Fitting in is a challenge in its own way. But it's all fun as we learn and meet new experiences in life by and by.
