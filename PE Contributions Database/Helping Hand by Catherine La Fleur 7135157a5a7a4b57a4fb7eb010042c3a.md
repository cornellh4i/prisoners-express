**Helping Hand by Catherine La Fleur**

My life is full of excitement these days. After my head trip at the hospital, the medical staff at Camp Prisoney Land have decided that I must appear at 5 a.m. every morning to have my blood pressure checked. I am not a morning person. Previously, it was all I could do to wake up on time and start the day. Not that I am grumpy. No, I awake disgustingly happy and chirpy. However, am I really awake? And is it the real Catherine who is operating here?

The answer to that question is no. Someone is occupying the driver’s seat. Let’s call it the entity, a horrible happy morning type beast. The entity arises at 4 a.m. every morning and takes care of the routine: wash, brush, dress, yoga, tea, check the email. All this takes 45 minutes. I am still sleeping. I never have any memory of this.

There is a fifteen minute break where the entity steers my body up to the laundry room, next to the dorm’s front door. It parks me in a plastic chair. Fifteen minutes pass by until the office shrieks “Insulin and laundry.” This occurs less than three feet from my body which finally jars me awake.

I only have three speeds in the morning: stop, mosey, and amble. I mosey out the front door, only to be entangled by the first obstacle. There is a large oak tree growing next to Delta Dorm’s door. It is filled with birds, singing, chirping birds. The birds attract a type of fly to their nests. The flies lay their eggs and the resulting maggots hang down on long silken strands.

The entity is still In charge as I blunder into these filaments every single day. My arms fly up and I give out a little scream. The result is that I saved everyone behind me in line, Including the laundry cart with our clothes and bedding, from the dread maggot creatures.

At the infirmary, I hang out with the diabetics until early breakfast. They brush me down with paper towels then I sit in the seat by the exit stairwell. There is a disgusting smell no cleaning product can erase because creatures crawl in there and die. The usual prison ruffians, birds, rats, snacks, etc.

Because I sit near the door, I am the de facto line leader to breakfast. The entity leads everyone down the stairs and straight into the second obstacle. Yet another oak tree with maggot strings hanging from it.

The entity selflessly drives my body straight through the strands. Thus I have sacrificed for the benefit of those following me. It's just my entity’s way of lending a helping hand to mankind.
