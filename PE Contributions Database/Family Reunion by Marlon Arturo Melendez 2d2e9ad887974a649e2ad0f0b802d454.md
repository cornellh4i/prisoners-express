**"Family Reunion" by Marlon Arturo Melendez**

When I was a kid in the eighties, family reunions were the best. Every kid’s birthday was celebrated and almost every holiday. Any opportunity was taken to come together.

Adults would wear their nicest clothes and finest jewelry. Their kids bore the same appearance, to a lesser extent, but were flashy nonetheless.

The stereo would loudly play music that reminded us of our home country. Salsa, cumbias, and merengue the night away. The food was also a reminder of home. Most times it was tamales, turkey or chicken dinner or the Salvadoran favorite, pupusas.

Sometimes a DJ would be hired, everyone danced and laughed and had so much fun. Love reigned in all our hearts and happiness was in all our faces. Unity as well. Family reunions were almost like celebrations of survival.

Back in the home country, people were being massacred daily by the hundred. Families hid or fled in fear from blood thirst death squads, military bombings, and oligarch-created right wing paramilitaries.

As time went on, at the end of the eighties and early nineties, the love and unity in my family remained unchanged. However, family reunions were less common. The family had also grown in numbers. Birthday parties and baby showers allowed for some reunions.

In El Salvador the carnage continued. Tens of thousands were indiscriminately being murdered. Women, children, and the elderly; whole families wiped out in seconds. Community leaders and the religious, even foreigners, suffered the same fate. Death was no longer feared; it had become expected. But the people united.

My family kept growing in the U.S. Growing in numbers and growing apart. Family reunions became rare.

Thankfully, by the mid-nineties, the Civil War came to an end. A peace accord was signed. Those that survived the horror made their way back to the towns and villages they had fled and found them completely destroyed. Amid the rubble, they found the remains of their loved ones. There was a haunting smell of death and smoke in the air. Dead or alive, people felt a sense of comfort with reuniting with their family members. It was a new opportunity to recreate their family. They didn’t ask for it, but they were glad to be alive to do it.

By the late nineties, there was perhaps one family reunion comparable to the ones we had when we first arrived in the U.S. from El Salvador. Personal feuds, resentment, unkept promises, unaccomplished expectations, lack of unity when situations got bad were some of the factors that dissolved the tradition of family reunions.

While the situation in the home country began normalizing, my family split apart. Where the dust settled and families rebuilt their lives in El Salvador, my family moved far away from each other. Two or three cities over.

At the end of the nineties, the new generation of my family was in full bloom. As kids, they grew up around each other, as time went on they casually spoke to each other and by chance would sometimes meet up. The home country was nothing but a detail of their parents’ past and the Civil War simply something that occurred of little importance today.

Family reunions? Never again, not the kind that we had when we first got to the U.S. My family became sort of “cliquish” and apathetic to one another. It’s almost as if when we sought refuge from civil war, we were celebrating the survival of our family. Survival and unity away from the horror of war. But as the Civil War ended so did my family’s spirit of inseparability. The survival of our entire family, the oneness amongst us, the love and joy that embraced us all at family reunions ended with the Civil War in El Salvador. But we were in the U.S.
