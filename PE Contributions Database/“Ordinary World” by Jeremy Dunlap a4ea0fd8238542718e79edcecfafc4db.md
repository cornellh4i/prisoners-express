**“Ordinary World” by Jeremy Dunlap**

****I was born in 1980 so I’m only thirty-six which shouldn’t quite be old enough to sit around and reminisce on “glory days,” as Bruce Springsteen would say. However I was listening to Duran Duran’s song ‘Ordinary World,’ and it struck me that their song is well over twenty years old now. In fact most of the music that helped define my formulating years is at least that old, in some cases older. So much has changed since then, so I suppose I must be old enough to do some reminiscing.

Mom kept our record player in the living room and our house was always filled with music. Most mornings my brother and I were awakened by The Rolling Stones; Mick Jagger telling us how he couldn’t get no satisfaction, or by Led Zeppelin, Simon and Garfunkel, or Fleetwood Mac. One morning I kept dreaming that sheep were bleating in the living room only to find out it was Stevie Nicks singing ‘Gypsy’. If that confuses you just listen to the song and you’ll get it.

Those were days of making forts out of blankets and couch cushions, Nintendo, imaginary pirate adventures, and epic toy battles of G.I. Joe, He-Man, The Thundercats, Godzilla, Voltron, and various stuffed animals versus Superman. Who won? Superman. Why? Because he’s freaking *Superman.*

MTV still played music videos before reality TV sent it and a bunch of other channels to broadcasting hell. It was because of MTV that I found my favorite band to this day; U2. Even at eight years old I wondered who Bono couldn’t live with or without.

I rode my bike everywhere. Even on family camping trips to the lake, and I always had my Walkman. So did most kids I knew. Childhood obesity wasn’t really an issue then because we were always outside and active. We were without fear. Yeah we had video games, VHS and all, but those things were just part of our lives, not all of it. We were not slaves to cellphones (because they didn’t exist or were really expensive), laptops, tablets, apps etc. Instead we interacted like humans are supposed to: face-to-face.

I became a teenager and went through puberty during the grunge movement. Bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice In Chains changed the music world, particularly mine and their lyrics spoke to my angsty teenage soul. Those were songs my friends and I would headbang to, get high and escape to, or simply listen to while aimlessly driving around once we got our licenses.

The memories of those days seem endless; one long soundtrack in my mind. A song can instantly take me back. Back to when the future was bring and the possibilities limitless. Before everyone seemed so angry and afraid; before friends died young; before I screwed my life up; before the future seemed so dim. “Where is the life I recognize? Gone Away.”

I look around these days and feel like a stranger on this planet, sixteen years in prison will do that some. Still, life really is set to a soundtrack and old lyrics gain different meanings over time. Especially these:

“But I won’t cry for yesterday,

There’s an ordinary world,

Somehow I have to find.

And as I try to make my way,

To the ordinary world,

I will learn to survive.”

I don’t cry for my yesterdays because so many were beautiful. I weep for myself and the world now because of what has been lost. However there is an ordinary world I’m trying to get to, and I will learn to survive until I find it again.
