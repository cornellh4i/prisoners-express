"Girl On Bench" by Brandon Fleming

I could only imagine what the young lady was thinking. Her forlorn expression seemed to underline an overall garment of sadness and loneliness, a shadow of desertion, maybe even self imposed isolation.

Separated away from all the other hundreds, even thousands, of other children and young adults that progressively had taken to the streets to deal with all the growing effects of the degradation of today’s society as a whole. The terroristic effects of street drugs of gangland wars, broken marriages and homes, the list goes on in length for the numerous reasons why our youth have become more accustomed to fending for themselves. I watched the lonely young lady with her searching eyes gaze upon her cigarette as if a slender amount of cut tobacco enclosed in a roll of paper would unwrap all the mysteries of life’s struggles.

Or maybe she was just contemplating her chipped fingernail polish and wondering why her boyfriend had not yet arrived.

To take this individual’s looks or even body language for granted was to assume, and you’re probably familiar with the old adage, to assume make an ASS of U and ME! Or maybe assumption is simply a way of putting an individual in line with heaven. Perceptions are tricky.
