**Flying by Jack Simpson**

I have been in love with flight since I was a small child. Planes from World War two held a lot of interest. When a plane would fly over, I’d find myself stopping what I was doing to get a closer look. God forbid if a helicopter would fly close to me. I would totally be into it. Watching it fly by.

On the way to school one morning, a loud sound caught my attention. I forgot about school and found myself in front of my teacher. Did I say I was counted tardy for class? Guess that made her feel real good since I was late. Now grant you I did show up. As it was I had to tell the whole class why I was Late. I did and some of them laughed. It really didn’t bother me until she told me that I would never finish school, much less learn how to fly.

It just so happened I did finish school and I do know how to fly. I have flown in all types of aircrafts. Keep in mind I was not the one in control. I was flown in helicopters and commercial aircrafts. Most of these were used to transport me and the crew to job sites.

I have had days where I would sit and read about flying. The mechanics of how the different parts work. Plus I had a pilot who was certified that talked to me and we shared the dynamics of the flight. I do believe I could pass the test if given a chance. There are two things in life that would stop me from getting certified. My health for one and my age had a lot to do with it. So the best I can do now is just enjoy the flight while someone else is in control. I do believe the world would be a lot safer without me in the air.

Once you have sat in an aircraft that has been grounded for years, you really get a feel of how the controls work without flight. The plane I had sat in was at Springs Park. A place that we all as children began to love. The war plane was just sitting there with nothing better to do except rust away. Of course it gave me the feeling of flying without leaving the ground. Most of all once my feet touched the pedal and pulled back on the stick. I was no longer grounded.

Over the years I have had the chance to fly commercial and other types of aircraft. Most of which carried me to jobs I held while working for a large company. There would be times when the noise of the aircraft was pointed upward. I am not talking about straight up. It sure felt that way. The whole flight I don’t believe it ever leveled off.

I was thinking after all these years I would be over the thought about flying. Well let’s just say, I hope when I do pass on I will have wings of my own. Until then I will keep my eyes and ears to the sky. Hoping that one day I will be able to fly again. This is how I feel about flying. The one song that the group Berlin sang in the mid eighties. “Take my breath away.” That will say it all. Happy flying.
