**BELIEVE IT OR NOT** By Philip L. Rath

“Believe it or not” is a statement that activates the skeptic in me and negates any statements immediately following that declaration! Red flags wave in my mind and the Blarney stone falls painfully on my foot. At my age, I feel that I heard enough BS to fertilize the entire state of Texas!

Six years, 5 months, 22 days, and 15 hours in the US army, almost 4 decades in prison and the father of 3 sons have exposed me to about any story or tale going around, and many times, numerous versions of the same blarney.

Now don’t get me wrong, I do love a good yarn and I admire authors of good fiction. What I cannot tolerate is some person trying to pass off bad fiction as fact! I am no smarter than the next guy, and judging by my life’s path, I am dumber than most, but I am not tolerant of someone trying to pass time-worn stories off as factual! If only I had a dollar for every time someone has tried to sell me on the story of the guy looking for a used car to drive to work only to find a classic Corvette/Ferrari/Mustang/Bugotti in an old ladies’ garage and she would only accept $200.00 for it! I could buy myself a garage full of dream cars with those dollars!

War stories are as big a part of Army life as basic training, shined boots and dog tags. These started the day you were assigned a drill instructor and he opened his mouth! It wasn’t until months later you discovered he was telling a war story and he hadn’t been a war hero at all, but a chaplain’s clerk or finance geek before cross-training as a D.I. It didn’t take long for you to realize that not every G.I. with more time in service than you was NOT a sniper, Special Ops or Delta Force! Those who were these things just didn’t talk about it like last years’ fishing story!

It doesn’t take long for prisoners to recognize those with a tendency to lie like a cheap carpet! (Not all of these liars are prisoners either if you get my drift) You see them coming across the yard and you suddenly remember you have an errand in the opposite direction. “Did you hear they’re reducing the minimum maximum?” That line is spoken more often than “good morning” here in Missouri! Give me a break! No legislator has voted on the law or discussed it in committee, but these yarn spinners think they have an inside track on the workings of government.. but they haven’t a clue! These liars have produced more yarns than a knitting shop, the tales never become true, yet you hear numerous other inmates believing every tale they tell! I have a few bridges for sale if you have the cash!!!

Turn on the TV any time of day and you will hear our president weaving a web of lies more intricate and deadly than any spider. One day we’ve beaten ISIS, the next day they are almost under control. He declares on the campaign trail, in front of live TV cameras and thousands of supporters, that he had no ongoing deal with Russia, then months later he declares his deals with Russia did not affect his decision. Every week brings out another string of lies that his supporters accept as gospels and his detractors cite as evidence wide gap in public opinion where truth and facts are on the line? With the court of the Drama Queen? Believe it or not, that is where we are at this point of history. As for me, I will hold to my values and side with the power of TRUTH.

On the other hand, I can start charging an hourly fee to listen to these stories with a double indemnity fee if the story doesn’t pan out in 90 days or evidence proves the story is not true. I’m willing to bet that at this rate I could afford to hire my own lobbyist to secure legislation terminating the minimum maximum sentencing laws.

If you want to impress me, hold my attention or gain my approval, tell me a short, fact-filled account of some event in your life. Chances are that experience was one that I have never had nor ever heard about, and you will grab my attention. I’ll be anxious to listen to you and learn something from you.

If you’d stop rewarding the storytellers by listening to them and wasting your precious time you would find they’d eventually get the hint and perhaps develop a more productive form of communicating and learn to speak truthfully. Can you imagine living without having to duck and dodge the BS’ers, being able to listen with appreciation to a story with veracity and come away with your life enriched? Just set your expectations of communications with others a little higher and this will become your reality.

While I have your attention let me tell you about my walks to school in the 50s, when we have to walk 2.5 miles uphill to school both ways, through 6’ snow drifts with winds…”Believe it or not”!!
