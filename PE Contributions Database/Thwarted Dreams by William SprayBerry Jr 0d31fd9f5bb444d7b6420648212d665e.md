**“Thwarted Dreams” by William Sprayberry Jr.**

****My life is a maze of thwarted dreams. The one common factor in all those thwarted dreams is the man sitting here writing this--me.

I was a good kid growing up. The worst thing my parents had to worry about was me and my brother Joey fighting, either with each other, or with someone else. We were best friends, so when we fought each other, it was never bad.

I was smart, everybody just knew I was gonna be something special. Personally, I never felt like I was great at anything, other than writing and I was scared to seriously pursue that because if I failed, then I’d have nothing left that I felt good at. My dream was to write a book but due to my fear of failure, I ignored the talent God gave me then questioned why He made me. I thwarted my dream, the one God had planned for me.

My parents worked hard to give us everything we needed. We never had to wonder if we were loved. My dad, William, worked many hours, no matter whether he was tired or fatigued, just so he could provide for us. The few times he took off work were weekends when he would take us hunting. I still remember those early mornings at camp. It would be so cold you could see the air that you breathed exhaled in front of your face in what looked like tiny puffs of smoke. We’d have all our camouflage gear on. It would still be dark outside, the dark right before the dawn as we headed out to our stands. I can still smell the earth covered with fresh morning dew. The scent of the pine trees I never go tired of. I miss those weekends so much. My dream was to kill a big buck. The closest I ever got was a coyote. Now I can’t even own a gun--thwarted dream.

My mom, Brenda, did a lot of the raising because my dad worked so much. One of the proudest times I remember was when mom graduated nursing school. I was young but that was a big deal. Mom had made something of herself and set a fine example for us. She was always very protective. When me and Joey stayed home by ourselves the first time, we thought we were hot stuff. Little did we know, mom never left, she stayed outside to make sure we were okay. That was mom being mom. Once, we came home from school and she had made a note sending us on a treasure hunt. When we reached the end of the hunt, we would get our treasure--dessert. When we got to the tree where the dessert was supposed to be, she said, “oops, I forgot to put it out here.” Of course she didn’t forget, you can’t just leave dessert outside but when you’re a kid, you don’t think of that. What mattered was that mom made dessert for us, and we got to go on a treasure hunt. Small things, like walking around the yard with a sharpie, drawing smiley faces on rocks, was a blast. I loved spending time with mom and still do. My dream was to make them proud and even though they say they are, I know the truth. Thwarted dreams.

I met a beautiful woman named Megan, we called her Nikki. I feel in love for the first time in my life and she became my wife. Unfortunately, I was addicted to drugs. I thought I needed the drugs to make me happy. I ended up in prison and realized how happy I was, just being with her, but it was too late. My dream was to marry one person and have it last forever. Thwarted dreams.

Next, I met the second woman I ever loved. Barbara was also beautiful. Her two daughters called me Daddy Jay. I had my own little family; God had answered my prayers. I wanted to give them the world. Instead I came back to prison. Thwarted dreams.

Those are my dreams I’ve thwarted but what about the dreams of others? My parents wanted me to be a success, those two women wanted us to last forever and my stepdaughters always wanted me to be Daddy Jay. I thwarted their dreams too. When I get another chance the only thing I’ll be thwarting is the person I was before.
