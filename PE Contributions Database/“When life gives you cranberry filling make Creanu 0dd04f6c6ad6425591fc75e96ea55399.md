**“When life gives you cranberry filling make Creanut Butter!” By Jeremy Brown**

So lately we’ve been givin’ by our oh so nice Daycare providers Cranberry Pie filling. It’s not good by itself and is Sugarless. So we started to take it back to the dorm with us in a sandwich baggy. We then placed this first full of Cranberry Pie filling in a plastic bowl. We then buy a 6 ounce 47¢ Peanut Butter called Squeeze-Ums made by the Price Gouging Keefe Corporation, and squeeze two packs of this processed Synthetic peanut butter sitting on a shelf for 6 months before we get it into the plastic bowl that I’ve had for 6 years but now can’t find because someone stole it last night (the Bloody Bastard). So we mix said peanut butter with said cranberry pie filling and 2 equals with Saccharine Bone cancer causing sugar element and mix it for 2 ½ minutes. Any longer and it becomes mush watery. It took me a watch timer and 26 and a half tries of Test tasting to perfect the mix and time. The speed of your hand whipping it must be slow or too fast “somewhere in the middle” (that song gets stuck in my head). Only follow these instructions if you seek precise perfection and seek to calm an obsessive compulsive disorder but I don’t call it a disorder only an order. Does seeking perfection make me a Diss or an order? Only you yourself may decide this one. Who the hell came up with all of these medical diagnoses anyways. We are Humans and all are different and unique. Let us be “Big Pharma”. Well then you slap this “Creanut Butter” on a Honey Bun or Bread or a Romen Plain cooked soup.

Author’s note: Satire, Dry Humor, Emphasis and Embellishment used for Amazingness, haha life is irony! So make some Creanut Butter Today it might be the last A-MAZE-ING Thing you do.
