**Flying by Hester Wesley**

She lays waiting. Feigning sleep. Waiting for me. Tracing delicately subtle curves with the tips of my fingers. I know her so well. Closing my eyes I breathe in her intoxicating scent. My hand finds her secret, hidden place. Touching her button, I gently press, bringing her trembling to life. She purrs with contentment, stretching, reaching. Just her and I, flying in a blue sky. Bliss.

Never quiet. Never alone

Always light, Even at night

Doors clang, a steel plug in the wall

Stark, bunk bedded with sink and toilet

Confined as punishment

Yet, punishment punished every day

Two men living in a bathroom

The barn was empty, in disrepair

Old hoofprints and tufts of hair

Dust and musty air

Ghosts of cowboys stand and stare

A Heart Beats Time

With Tires Whine

Stygian Gloom

Under New Moon

The Freedom of Forward

Past but Pursues

Through Memories of Strife

To See Tomorrow, Revealed in the night

Like Straightened Curves Lit by a Morning Star

Endless Flight

Through Storms of Night

Bolts of Heaven Fade from Sight

Argent Ribbon ‘neath Luna’s Light

The Curse of Morpheus, a Futile Flight

Wonders and Beauty of Stars so Bright.

Trees and Dirt

The Snake Lies Still

Dark and Dank

Odor Rank

The Scurry of Mice

Beneath a House So Nice

Stair Descend

They Creak and Groan

Air of dust, Reek of Decay

Dim Light, Dark Corners

The Wind was blowing hard

Trash and leaves filled the air

Everyday the same thing, It made me tired

I know just how the trash and leaves must feel.
