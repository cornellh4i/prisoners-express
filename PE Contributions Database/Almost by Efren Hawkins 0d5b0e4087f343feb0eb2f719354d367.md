**Almost by Efren Hawkins**

Almost, this word makes me reflect on the day I almost gave up on life. It was a little of this and a lot of that that had brought me to this moment in my life. As I degraded myself with my thoughts, it was the first time in my life where I had nowhere to turn, or so I thought.

Let me paint you a picture first. I’m from Southwest Georgia. Yeah, cow farms, hog farms, and cotton fields. It’s raining and I’m on the run. I did have a vehicle but it got stuck on a dirt road. Out of anger I set it on fire, because now I had to walk in the rain and mud. What an unforeseen blessing!

As I made my way through the woods, my anger and confusion gave way to curiosity. While walking I started to reflect on memories of my past. These thoughts made me call a number of people. I guess they could hear it in my voice that I had given up because they gave me some of the most encouraging words I’ve heard in my life and told me they still loved me.

Can you imagine even your victim sending you messages of forgiveness as they lay in the hospital trying to survive? I walked in the woods for about ten hours before I realized I was going in circles. I realized this when I saw the same horse in the same field I’d passed earlier. I couldn’t believe I had been going in circles all that time. Then everything came to a point. I always thought I would go out in a blaze of glory. The police finally had me trapped in a patch of woods. As I sat there watching their setup, I reflected on my family and Angel, my high school sweetheart. For some strange reason, I felt that she was watching me. I put my gun down and walked out with my hands up, because life was worth far more than I was about to give it up for. Thank you!
