I was getting real money, and for the past 19 years, money has been good, though I’ve been in prison. I lost people, family, love, my brothers. Losing my mind without money. It’s hard to lose the way you live, and while others say you’re the same person, how can you be without money? Time brings strength, and if I want to make money or get a job or business, I educate myself through my loss.

I understand everyone is lost, and I don’t want to open up because of my losses. If I lose anyone or anything, it’s like oh well. I’m really glad I went through the loss because I’m strong, just wait.
