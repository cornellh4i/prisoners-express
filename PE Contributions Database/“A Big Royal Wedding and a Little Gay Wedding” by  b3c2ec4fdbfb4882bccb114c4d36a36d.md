**“A Big Royal Wedding and a Little Gay Wedding” by Catherine LaFleur**

****The viewing party arose early on that Saturday. May 19th was a day we had been anticipating for months. Hot tea was served to everyone sitting in the dayroom along with sandwich cookies and a selection of handmade oatmeal, chocolate, and coffee bar cookies. Paper flowers had been made and garlanded the television. Some die-hard fans of Meghan and Prince Harry wore fascinators made from Coca-Cola and Sprite boxes with pop up flowers. I stood on the second tier watching and waiting along with the personages in the chapel.

Who doesn’t like a fairytale wedding? And it was indeed perfect. When Meghan exited the car and paused for a moment, executed a little three-quarter turn, and stood posed oh so elegantly, a little sigh went up from all of us. As she walked down the aisle, we noticed Prince Harry wiping away tears. Yes, she was that beautiful. You could read his lips when he told Meghan “you look amazing.”

Morning count was called and no one moved a muscle. The officer came to the rail to find out what was going on, only to be sucked into the event on the screen. We made it to the horse drawn carriage (swoon). Everyone who watched the Big Royal Wedding was talking about it all day long.

Today, June 22nd, my best friend’s son, Kavanaugh, is getting married. He’s thirty, a tall strapping red-haired boy, and yes he’s still a boy to me. I taught him in seventh grade and spent a summer on house arrest with him. Obviously, I was the one on house arrest. We played a ton of video and board games, fifty million card games, watched every video known to the free world, and ate an equal amount of pizza. My friend- his mother- took off for a two week yoga retreat, leaving me as the adult in charge. I’ll never forget her trust in me nor will I forget Kav’s endless patience in dealing with a house-bound adult. And now he’s getting married!

It’s a May-December romance. Kav popped the question to his partner and Kav has done all the planning. The event is taking place in a tiny chapel way up in the mountains of Colorado. Kav and El moved there shortly after I came to prison. Unlike the big royal wedding, the chapel only seats twenty-five people. It’s a forty minute hike up the side of the mountain. For most of the year there is some snow on the ground. The wedding guests will be wearing Patagonia and North Face, no fascinators will be in evidence. Although I think my friend may put some pink streaks in her hair. Kav sings with the Denver Gay Men’s Chorus, and a small quartet will provide vocal music along with a solo violin.

Sadly I will not be attending the little gay wedding but I expect it to be just a fairytale, because these two love birds, surrounded by the friends and family who care about them and accept them, can marry and pursue a dream of marital happiness just like Meghan and Harry.
