**“Emerging From the Fog” by John Naylor**

The world changes so fast, though some things never do. I know sleep apnea isn’t something everyone suffers from. It’s a fairly common condition, though, and it leaves a lot of people falling asleep due to a lack of healthy sleep. Especially if they don’t use a CPAP mask when they sleep.

My Dad has always been a dedicated working man. Though I don’t think anywhere he worked acknowledged how important he was to general operations. He has vast experience and knowledge that kept assembly lines running as he always made machines work despite a lack of new parts. So he wasn’t just a journeyman electrician. He salvaged parts from older machines when every other electrician gave up and seemed comfortable with production going down. Then in those times his efforts and abilities were recognized. Sometimes Dad would start to nod off in church, because he was exhausted from the sleep apnea. We would give him a gentle nudge and he’d emerge from the fog.

This country has had some tough breaks. There are no perfect people. There will never be a perfect president for America. You can’t please everybody all of the time. We can pull together because we need our fellow Americans. In a random situation you may soon be the only man who keeps America running, even if you need a nudge now and then. Together America can emerge from the fog.
