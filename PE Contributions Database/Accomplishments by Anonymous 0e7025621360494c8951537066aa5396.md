**Accomplishments by Unknown Author**

Well this is important even when there is little to no shout of encouragement. In a state where a boost or upgrade seldom occurs. We need to pass along. But our accomplishments are a great tool to do just that. Mine are grand, even so they aid toward my goals. Really each one can have multiple effects. Both on our-self and those we share with.

The best is this: How do we (each person reading) identify such accomplishments? Because if he or she can not do that task at all then that person has none… Some are small, and some are large. There will always be so many only because once thought about then they seem to multiply.

There are even times or instances when those accomplishments chain link to others and an explosion occurs. As in this: When one action couples other actions then those first accomplishments make the others. That is in theory though and for this safe conversation. In this instant each is important.

The main point: accomplishments. There is so much to be done there, the uses and terms. So, what is the best form in explaining my own while also reaching the reader here. (You) I am explaining both how to keep in mind in a healthy way. And using that for an advantage. I will start slow then gradually gain. This is a strong way to share. Take the time recall your own accomplishments. First: Keeping a good idea of them. Because that is for him or her to do themselves, Almost like never forgetting them. Being able to explain them properly. I have had trouble with this topic in the past. When the stage calls for a performance. I mean even writing them all down and going to that list reference. A basic understanding? Most people you or I know do not keep a secret list of their goals and the ones finished. Nor do they have accomplishments at the ready. So this really is higher than normal, it works…

Second: Plant for another one. Remember the already accomplished. From those see how any person might do the same. That means to duplicate what can be done more than just once. Most of the time that already has happened. Really though, this is used for correctness in how those same actions are in place.

More in detail, try to keep a steady amount of accomplishments. That is good and very well. Because to continue with confidence on the face is one in itself. That also helps him or her to see goals too.

My own examples of such accomplishments are very grand. I can share these. Having graduated high school after failing countless tests in the process. But the accomplishment was not just completing but how that did happen. There was the mountain to climb. Transportation became a major problem. That was solved, but add one one more to the list of accomplishments. Next accomplishment was a job at the same time. Yes, I kept stacking until the goal was reached. That new car had payments due and gas had to be filled. THat means first do what needs to be done just to graduate. Get here everyday. Make it back and forth to work and keep being ready to make another new accomplishment. That happened.

Another one for me is my solo career, from leaving (or being removed) from a group that was shy and unsettled. After the first project happened I had to produce a second on my own. That was accomplished. In short, there are many and don’t forget one to add to the list…

It is good to have a positive, motivated drive. That is said well. That makes easy communication though at times we can be misunderstood. Keep moving to the next. I shared here a small one and then a large one. Those are examples. As the days continue there is a flow of them waiting to be done correctly. They even link. Share them with yourself or those willing to hear. Keep a list for your own goodness. Well in the mind or even paper. Correctness. Plan for another: Duplicate. That is important. Remember what they look like because it’s not good to forget them, even when feeling the heat.

Take each section here and get a real good idea of what I am saying, because hopefully that will be a great accomplishment too.
