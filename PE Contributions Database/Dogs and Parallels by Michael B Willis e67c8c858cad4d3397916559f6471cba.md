***Dogs and Parallels* by Michael B. Willis**

Dog. This is what my wife would call me when I dances too close to another woman at the club, or, looked just a “fraction” of a second too long at a women’s ass.

“Dawg” this is what your “homeboys” call you these days. Sounds the same doesn’t it? But, I don’t look anything like this picture in your magazine, do I? I didn’t think so. I’ve always viewed myself as the “epitome” of creation - “created i the best of molds”.

I’m referred to as “man”. Not “gnat”, “bat”, “cat”, “rat”, or “dog” (spelled - either way. This “misnomer” really rubs me the wrong way. Let us imagine the dog in the photo’s reaction to being called “man”, “cat”, “squirrel”, or “porcupine”. He or she (I didn’t check) would probably be offended and bite you, hump your leg, or, piss on you. Formally marking his “territory” and changing your new name to “Bitch”. How would this make you feel? Words both build and destroy. However, no word that you create in your mind can ever erase who and what I am. Which is, an independently minded, born to succeed, male human being. Which is not spelling D-O-G or D-A-W-G. I digress.
