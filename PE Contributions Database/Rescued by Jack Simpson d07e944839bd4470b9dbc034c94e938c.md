**Rescued by Jack Simpson**

Hillbilly and I were making our rounds through the area we worked. We both had been hired to attend the garden, count fire ant hills, and to make sure no tools were left out by mistake.

We sat on a little hill enjoying the warm sun because not only was it cold that morning, sea gulls had returned to the compound. Two were flying as if one was chasing the other.

The crew from the road were using a bucket truck to replace the burned out lights. We heard yelling from a distance. As we looked, the fellows pointed to the same two seagulls. It wasn’t a minute or two that they landed in the collards we both had been working on earlier.

Once we got close enough to see what was really going on. The two birds were exhausted. Though one of the gulls' padded foot was stuck in a hook. The gull that caught my eye must have had a lure stuck in its beak. I knew they couldn’t survive like that.

I placed my hat over one of the gull’s head. It calmed it down quickly. Talking seemed to help calm the other one. The other gull had a hat that covered its head also.

Hillbilly got a pair of needle nose pliers which had a built in cutter on the side. As I cut the barb and pulled the remainder through the web of its foot. It did not try to peck me or struggle to get away. I felt relief to know it would be just fine.

The one with the barb had dug a one inch gash into its beak. It sat quietly as I removed it. Hillbilly removed his hat and I did the same. We backed away so the birds could get a little breathing room. It only took a couple of minutes before they flew away.

To our surprise they circled a couple of times in the area we were in. Then they were gone. The lure was given to our boss man and it remained in his desk until well after he retired. If the two had stayed the way they were. surely the two would have perished.

For once I can say the two of us rescued two living birds and do hope they had enjoyed a healthy life. Not only did we feel good about helping out. We knew that they were in good hands that day.
