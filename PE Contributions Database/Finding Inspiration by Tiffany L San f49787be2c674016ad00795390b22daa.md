**Finding Inspiration by Tiffany L. San**

Why save what won’t save me?

Why give myself to feed the tapeworm of life?

Every bit of who we are and what we may become came from one and will never return, not even upon death.

Unaccountable particles of recycled cosmic waste molded together into unique masses of slime and calcium bumbling along aimlessly until the end

A dusty shed, grey and old, rotting and frail

Windswept, tattered curtains flopping

Staccato and irregular

Like a metronome with the hiccups

Fragments of longing wrapped memories

Dispersed absentmindedly before heat and mouth shut tight

Unable to be pried open by leverage or love

Why save what won’t save me?

I’ve only ever always wanted to wear a cape
