**Running From Nothing by Delvin Diles**

High school was out for summer, and I was stuck at the house doing chores. In the middle of a hand-washed load of dishes, I sighed and looked at the old cracked sink, kitchen counter and wire dish rack, out the paint-chipped wood framed window at the weedy unkempt backyard I’d have to mow.

Then, I took a longer glance at Mama’s car keys.

I thought she was taking a nap, so I put the car in neutral and pushed it past three houses before I cranked the engine. No way that awakened her. But somehow, seconds later, she appeared in the rearview mirror running in the middle of the street screaming, “DELVIN! GET OUT OF MY CAR!”

I accelerated.

For no good reason, as a kid and teen, I repeatedly ran away. I wasn’t physically, sexually, or even verbally abused at home. Mama was a quiet, responsible, hardworking single parent, undeserving of the grief I gave her. Did all she could to raise me right. And I took her car that day out of boredom.

Initially, I was just gonna go see my girlfriend, Linda Kay, face the music later. Not knowing Waco’s streets well enough, I got lost. As the sun set with my hopes at finding Kay’s house, I changed my plan to go back home. My new plan included driving 30 miles south to my hometown (where it’s impossible to get lost), picking up friends and getting deadface drunk. The rest was unplanned.

A week later, I was in jail, separated from Mama’s car by over 50 miles after its engine died on Highway 6, where we left it before hitchhiking to Waxahachie to visit a friend’s mom.

To start my new life as a runaway, I went into a clothing store with a group of boosters and got caught trying to steal a pair of Docker’s slacks. The store owner actually chased me around the parking lot in his Honda Accord. I out ran him, caught up with my crew, blocks away. “You slow,” one of ‘em chided. Suddenly, red and blue lights flashed with a siren blast, and my accomplices scattered into alleys/backyards/manholes somewhere. They knew the area. I was arrested.

After being bailed out hours later, my uncle drove and yelled, while in the backseat, Mama grabbed my collar and punched my eye one good time. A tear didn’t fall until my uncle warned, “You best not hit her back either!” Broken, I sobbed, “I can’t believe you think I’d hit my own Mama.”

“You stole her car!” he pointed out.

“I didn’t steal it,” I explained, wiping my face. “I just borrowed it.” Mama actually chuckled at that, shaking her head. With a barely concealed smirk, Uncle Gene concluded, “That ain’t funny, boy.”

I was 18 when I decided to leave my hometown for Dallas one night. I was bored with small town life again. Mama didn’t think that was a good idea. That I was moving too fast for my budget and experience which was close to zero on both counts.

In less than a year in the city, I found myself hiding out in a dark motel, wanted for murder. I spent five teenage years running from boredom right into a life sentence.

I should’ve just finished the dishes.
