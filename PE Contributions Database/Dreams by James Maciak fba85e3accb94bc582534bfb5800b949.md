**Dreams by James Maciak**

Gina: “Look at that plane up there Cindy. That will be us one day, flying to Paris or Germany.”

Cindy: “What kind of cigarette are you smoking Gina? You know we’re stuck in this small town and we probably won’t ever even leave West Virginia.”

Gina: “I’m going to one day and travel the world. I’ll be damned if I stay in this hick town and marry a coal miner to take care of the kids and worry everyday whether or not he will come home.”

Cindy: “So how do you plan on paying for your big trip?”

Gina: “Well, I’ve been thinking. I’m going to apply for WVU this year. I’m want to study history and language. I figure I could always get work somewhere if I speak several languages and know World History.”

Cindy: “Make sure you send me a postcard every now and then. You dream too much Gina.”

Gina: “There is nothing wrong with having dreams Cindy. Everyone needs a dream. I’m going to live mine.”
