**by Gerald R. Durst**

I was out on a camping trip late last winter. The ground was starting to thaw. Bare patches of group were visible here and there. It was late afternoon, and I had set up camp in a small clearing. I had a small fire going in a shallow pit I had dug, and using scavenged wood from inside the tree line for food. I had learned reading Louis L’Amour Westerns the value of building a small fire, and moving closer to it for warmth.

I had just settled down to eat when he came trotting into the clearing. There I say on a log I had pulled over with a plate of squirrel and beans in one hard, and a fork in the other, with a hot cup of coffee on my left sitting on the log.

He came within 30 feet of where I sat almost directly across the fire from me. He was a big fella. Solid black except for a blaze of white that started at his chin, down his neck and broad check, and disappear between his front legs heading for, I assumed, his belly. He looked to be about 100 pounds of pure dog. I was never a good judge of height or length, but I would say he was close to 3 feet tall from front paws to the top of his head.

He just stood there with his tail down and his ears up, alert. But he showed no signs of threat. He was calm just staring at me. I would say that he had once had a family, or some human contact. I had another squirrel slow roasting over the fire, so I very slowly put the fork in my breast pocket of my flannel shirt, set down my plate, and pulled off a strip of meat from my dinner.

Now I slowly stood up and offered the treat to him, moving slowly past the fire. After I was ten steps beyond the fire I knelt down, made kisses at him, and offered the meal on my fingertips.

But now he faced me head on with a curious, but, hungry, look in his eyes. I sat still with meat on my fingers as he slowly walked to me.

He came up slowly, cautiously, sniffing the air. He slowly came right up to me, and gently took the squirrel meat from my hand. I knew then he was domesticated, and wondered if his owner was near, or if he was lost.

After he wolfed down the meat he just looked at me. I carefully put my hand back out to him keeping it just under his head as a sign of peace. He stretched out his nose and sniffed me. Then he licked my hand, and put his head under it indicating that we were cool, and the petting could commence.

As I petted him a voice like water falling on crystal said “Blackie! There you are. Are you mooching from him?” I looked up, and saw an angel in white. She was drop dead gorgeous. Long brown hair cascaded from under a white knit cap down past her shoulders with her ear tops playing peekaboo through her hair. She was about five-two or three with long legs and a slender, curvy figure. I mean more curves than the California Coastal Highway. She wore a white jacket and pants that matched. Her clothes set off the green of her eyes perfectly. Her smile was perfect showing off the whitest teeth I’d ever seen. Just seeing her made me feel just shy of ugly.

I said “No, he’s not a mooch, just friendly.”

Her laugh was like tinkling glass, her smile getting even bigger, and crinkling around her sparking eyes.

“He’s good at that” she replied. “My names Jo Beth, and this rascal is Blackie.” She said this as she came up, and wrapped her arms around him in a big hug. She looked right into my eyes, and I was trapped by the emeralds in hers.

“I’ve got squirrel cookin’ if you two care to join me.” I said “Oh! Pardon my rudeness, my name is Gerald.”

Again she laughed, and my heart melted. “You’re not rude, you’re very kind. You made friends with Blackie, and that makes you good in my book,” she said.

Needless to say they did join me for dinner. We talked like we had known each other all our lives, easy and free. The conversation just flowed like a swift moving stream. We’ve been married for three months now, and Blackie and I are the best of friends. Especially when we added Misty to our family. We’re expecting puppies next month, and our first child in eight-and-a-half!
