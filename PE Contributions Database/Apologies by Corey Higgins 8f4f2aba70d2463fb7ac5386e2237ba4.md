**“Apologies” by Corey Higgins**

Wow what a word could mean to one as myself. If I gave my apologies to the ones I hurt would it mean I was truly in the wrong, and I’m still feeling it was the right thing to do. But truth be told, I knew I was in the wrong and I went over the top, thought no one hurt me and got away with it. Truth is not just my apologies will work anymore, I need to live the life that my Gods had planned out for me.

Seeing my parents taught me to show respect to my Gods and all living things, and after running and fleeing from that lifestyle, I’ve still come right back to it only in a cell a little bigger than 5 by 8. I am always going to the Hole because the people I hurt were well-known and they still try to get to me; and I end up hurting more people. But what if I just gave out my apologies would it be like saying I forgave them and at the end of this short theme you’ll learn forgiveness is not one of my strong points, for they took the woman I loved, so I went to war. Hell is pain with love gone, but so is not being loved, once felt love.

So apologies, nah, not there yet.
