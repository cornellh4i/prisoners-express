**“A Widow Too Young” by Phillip L. Rath**

We’ve seen this woman far too many times in this country. If we’re not creating these widows with senseless wars, then we’re paying police officers, judges, and wanderns to fill the gap.

Isn't it enough that old age, disease, and natural disasters create these women in black without our elected officials in finding new and innovative ways to dress our young women in black?

A widow should be stopped and wrinkled, surrounded by her grown children and grandchildren. That is the natural order of things.

Are you responsible, directly or indirectly, in creating a widow too young?
