"Girl On Bench" by Delvin Diles

This is my last cigarette. I just took my last drag off it. There’s maybe half a centimeter left, which I’ll let burn to cotton because my last pull was full, savored one. Hitting it again would only be dissatisfying, pissing me off further than I already am. The ember reaches its line and goes out. I flick the butt to the dirt patch of other dead cigs and live ants. As they scurry on, I sit upon the bench.

Now what? Here I am--broke, smokeless, and basically homeless. I would call Mr. Cranky Old Luddite and give him a chance to apologize, but ironically his infraction is the very thing that makes that impossible. I can’t believe he did that…

On another normal day in our apartment, he was telling me about somebody’s incompetence on the managerial staff at his job. I nodded, as I usually do, at the pauses in his monologue while arranging images on my Pinterest page with the iPhone he bought me. Then I heard the sigh again, so I told him, “I’m listening, babe.” So, as I’m modding the background of a selfie while waiting on him to continue--as a multitasking Millennial--this psycho snatches my phone, runs to the balcony, and shaking my hand off his arm, launches it into a busy street three stories below.

Wordlessly, I stared at him and he only scowled, breathing hard. After a few beats, I intoned, “Real mature. And smart. You’re the one who bought it and pays the bill.”

“Fuck you, you little gold-digging bitch!”

That stung. He’d never called me that before. I thought he liked buying me things. Refusing to let on how shaken I was, I stated flatly, “No, fuck you,” turned and left.

I didn’t even look for the phone, knowing it would be demolished by traffic if not the impact alone. I just walked until I got to the park to lay down on my favorite bench. Then I realized that I was crushing the cigarette pack tuck in my bra. I’d hidden them there because that old snob of a boyfriend I got (I mean, had!) always throws my packs away, “For [my] own good.” Whatever. I’m an adult. If I wanna ruin my health, that’s my business! I don’t smoke a pack a day anyway. Well, until today, because thanks to that anti-tech asshole… speaking of which, look who’s walking up the sidewalk. I get up before he can speak, and walk away from the bench. “Kayla! Baby, I’m sorry! Please come home!” he calls after me. I keep walking. He follows and pleads on, “Kayla! Please! I’m--I’ll get you another phone! Just… please don’t leave me!” I stop, turn around, let him close the space at a run, reach out and take hold of me before I inform him, “You’re damn right you are! AND a carton of Newports!”
