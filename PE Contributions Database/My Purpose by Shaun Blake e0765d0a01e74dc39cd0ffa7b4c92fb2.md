“My Purpose” by Shaun Blake

I believe life is a time of learning when I can prepare for eternal life and prove that I will use my free agency to do all that the Lord has commanded. During this mortal life, we are to love and serve others. When I don’t live in this manner, I am not worthy to go back to the presence of my Heavenly Father.

This is my belief learned as I grew up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints -- Mormons. I haven’t been successful in being an upstanding Mormon. But I truly believe the doctrines of salvation. As long as I’m alive, I have hope.
