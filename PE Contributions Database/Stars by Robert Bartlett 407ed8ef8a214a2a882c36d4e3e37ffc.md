**Stars by Robert Bartlett**

****There are billions of galaxies in the universe and billions of stars in a galaxy. Some of the lights we see in the night sky are actually groups of stars or even galaxies.

A star is a hot, fiery ball of plasma and gas. To the unaided eye, most stars appear white, but if you look carefully at the stars, you will see a dazzling array of colors. You can estimate a starâ€™s temperature by its color. There are hot red dwarves and huge blue stars.

Sol, our sun, is an ordinary yellow star on the outer fringe of an ordinary galaxy in an ordinary cluster of galaxies. A miracle occurred on its third planet a few billion years ago.

Carbon atoms had formed molecular bonds with atoms of many other elements, both metals and nonmetals, in thousands of combinations and permutations. Some were more stable than others, but some of the unstable ones were much more numerous than they should have been. When one unraveled, the parts repaired themselves, and there were two copies of the original! What was more, some of these were able to indirectly or directly modify their environments to create proper conditions for their replication.

Within a few hundred million years, life forms appeared in increasing complexity in diverse forms in the seas and on lands. Human beings appeared over 200,000 (perhaps 1,000,000 or more) years ago. Civilization began and eventually spread over most of the land areas of the planet.

Today, earthlings look up and see that there are billions of galaxies in the universe and billions of stars in a galaxy.
