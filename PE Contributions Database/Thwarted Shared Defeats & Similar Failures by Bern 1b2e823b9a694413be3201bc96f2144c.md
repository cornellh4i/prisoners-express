**“Thwarted: Shared Defeats & Similar Failures” by Bernard Wroblewski**

Each and every one of us human beings have experienced having our plans thwarted. Whether it be by defeat at the hands of an opponent or enemy, or be it by failure. Sometimes our plans are disrupted and thwarted by beings more powerful than us, by God for instance. Because the plans we have for ourselves are not cohesive with His designs for our life and destiny, we are often bamboozled, sad and outraged by this prospect.

We tend to blame God for it all, but think about it. Would God thwart your plans to anger you or cause you pain intentionally? No, not the Awesome, Loving Father I know. He thwarts our plans, plots and schemes to help us, to help us grow, realize our mistakes, to draw us forever near to Him. Or, to simply protect from the danger we are heading for. Maybe, he’s answering a loved one who is praying for you. Who really knows?

Many of us had our dreams and plans thwarted by our own hands. We failed and failed badly. We chose to commit criminal acts in hopes to gain from it, be it power, respect, money or just a leg up. Trying to cheat and take an easy road on the path of an American Dream. We thought we were good, we’ll make it. Just a little act here, a little thing there, and then BOOM!! All hell rains down on our heads and the Government thwarts our plans and defeats us at the same time. Now we try to grow up. Try to make new plans. We try to thwart society’s opinions about us. We will make them see. We are not lost causes, nor pathetic excuses for human beings. The world shouldn’t just give up on us. Sure we made a mistake, we failed, but we are no less human than them. We have a heart, a brain and soul. We think, we feel, we dream, we love, we hope. And we can learn. We can evolve and we can change. We can still make positive contributions to society and our fellow man. And we will all, as one Nation, unified as a species, as brothers and sisters, we will stand arm in arm and thwart the evil that is plaguing our country, our lives, and our world. We’ll shout out with defiance against tyranny. We’ll bear arms against terrorism. We’ll fight for our rights, for our brethren. We’ll put a stop to the slaughter of innocent lives. To murder and violence brought on by racism, discrimination, and hate. We’ll thwart it all. We’ll beat back the darkness. And we’ll thwart it all with Love and Resilience.

So, stand up. Stand proud. Fight the good fight. Conquet evil, violence and hatred left and right. Let Hell’s Legions of hounds know that we are Lions!
