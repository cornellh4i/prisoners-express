**“Helping Out” by Detrick Shaw**

Mmm! What an interesting task! Energy!!! (My energy). I share with people that come in contact with me, my Energy. Helping out, I bring Energy, no matter the cost, you have me, right or wrong, good or bad, I’m there! Putting together a moment in a person like who need to be helped… Mentally is 90% of the time (Listen!). People do not need the assumption of love, but the compassion in the moment of loneliness. Get that thought; build on the opportunity to be able to help out and make this year about helping someone out. You can start by finding (Me!) and then sharing a few lines with me. I want to know; did I help you out?
