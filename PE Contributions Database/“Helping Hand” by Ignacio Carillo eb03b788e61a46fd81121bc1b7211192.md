When my daughter was seven I took her to the water parks of Wisconsin Dells to teach her how to swim. We took a training class at the hotel pool before heading off to the water park, pink floaties In hand. We walked alongside the teen pool watching the older kids navigate a tight rope course built over the pool when Katie suddenly jetted off and jumped in, and promptly sunk. I dropped her floaties and dove in after her, quickly snatching her up and demanding, what the heck Katie?!

She pointed toward a dark shadow In the corner of the pool. I sat her on the edge and instinctively reached down and pulled someone up. He couldn't have been more than five, rail thin, black as night, with bright brown eyes blinking hard and sputtering wet gasps from his mouth.

Are you ok, where’s your mom? I asked. More sputtering and blinking. I looked around for a frantic parent as I placed him on the pool deck. No sooner did I let go of him that he took off and disappeared Into the crowd.

I took Katie tightly by the hand, what were you thinking Katie? You can't swim in the deep pool yet, I pleaded, you scared me half to death. She looked at me matter-of-factly and simply said, I saw him, he needed help. Then she giggled.

I guess that says it all.
