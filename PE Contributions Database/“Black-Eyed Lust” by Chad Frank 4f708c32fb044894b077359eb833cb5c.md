**“Black-Eyed Lust” by Chad Frank**

Justin had tuned into Coast to Coast AM and logged onto his favorite website, lolitatwincest.ru, when he heard a knock on his dorm’s door.

Who could that be? he wondered. It was long after midnight on a Sunday, his roommates were gone for the weekend, and none of his friends were old enough to come visit so late.

The knocking grew more persistent as he zipped his pants and turned off his computer monitor.

“Coming!” he shouted, as he toddled over to answer the door.

Two girls, no older than 13, stood on the other side. Judging by their identical long white dresses, pale skin, and straight raven hair that covered their faces, they must’ve been twins.

Was he hallucinating? Justin wondered. He could have been, considering he’d not slept much in the past two days, cramming for finals. He rubbed his eyes, but they were still there. He bit his lower lip, and the sharp pain and tangy taste of blood validated reality. There was also a strange stench hovering in the air. Spoiled meat? Blood? Were these girls on their periods? Justin got weak in the knees as all his blood rushed to his groin. Pubescent girls on the rag had always been one of his biggest turn-ons.

They spoke in unison: “Let us in. You know you want to.” Their monotone voices made it hard to place an accent, but Justin could have sworn he heard a hint of Russian. Which turned him on even more because he had a fetish for Russian nymphets.

Justin was expecting to find Chris Hansen, and the rest of the *To Catch a Predator* crew when he peeked out into the hallway, but it was dark and empty as a midnight playground.

“This won’t take long,” they assured him.

They got that right, Justin through as he stepped out of the doorway and motioned them inside.

“Thank you,” they said.

“No. Thank you,” Justin replied.

Now that he could see their faces better, Justin noticed something strange about their eyes. They appeared to be solid black, even the sclera. A rush of fear surged through his body; he had to fight the urge to run screaming from the building, but his sexual desires were even stronger.

I’m just nervous, he told himself. “How about you girls go into my room and make yourselves comfortable?”

They nodded and smiled.

Justin watched as they walked into his bedroom and sat side by side on his bed.

He couldn’t believe his luck! Two identical Russian lolitas were sitting on his bed. All of his wildest fantasies were about to become true! He could barely contain his excitement as he shambled into the room of his gay roommates, Jeff and Chad, to grab a bottle of lube and some condoms.

When he got back into his room, Justin found the twins sitting with their backs to him, staring out the open window. A cool breeze was blowing, causing their hair to billow behind them like smoke from a funeral pyre. They were sitting so close, it looked like they were joined at the hip. They looked so beautifully innocent, Justin almost had a change of heart. Almost.

“All right girls” Justin said, closing the door behind him. “Ready?” A blood-curdling scream pierced the dead of night…
