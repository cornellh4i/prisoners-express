**Rescued: A Tribute to Frontliners by Rolf Rathmann**

“Don’t worry boys, it’s just a knife wound!” Pop yelled, slamming open our apartment door. Mom followed, clutching her stomach, collapsing on the couch. Pop phoned for help, my brother fetched ice, and I wandered aimlessly.

It started as a typical balmy Southern Californian evening - June 1st, 1977, and ended in chaos. Our parents had put us to bed, while they went for their nightly walk. Kids being kids, we stayed up late playing marbles in the light cast from the bathroom.

We heard a series of pops. Firecrackers? Screaming. Teens having fun? We were only three blocks from the junior high. Curious, we peered out of our second-story bedroom window.

Running below, to our horror, were our parents. Tossing on our robes, we hurried downstairs. They had been shot. Pop’s face was a road map of blood and mom, wearing her white and grey knit sweater bought when we vacationed in Tijuana, had been shot in the back.

While paramedics stabilized mom and stitched up Pop, the neighbor next door, Joanna, an up-and-coming actress, along with her two kids, took my brother and I in for the night.

We slept fitfully. Our dad returned from the hospital at 3:00 AM, and promptly, collected us. I can still remember my sweat soaked pajamas clinging to my skin. Mom survived, and returned to work two months later. Life changed forever.

A year later, our Pop died of a stroke. Medical professionals did all they could, but Mom eventually made the gut wrenching decision to discontinue life support.

Ever since, I’ve viewed society’s rescuers as heroic, dedicated, and honorable. Years later while taking classes at the city college, I befriended a student, Donna, who was in one of my classes. Coincidentally, she was the ER nurse on duty when my mother was there that fateful night. I had been given the opportunity to say “thank you.”

My brother and I were especially close to one aunt, who was a nurse for forty-five years. She served in WWII, and mended the wounded returning from Vietnam. Often sad, many times funny, the stories she related were nothing short of inspiring.

It would be a different type of rescuer, psychologists, who touched my life in 1997, when the airline I worked for exploded after take off, killing fifty-three colleagues. So many of us needed healing.

World-wide, the full display of courageous rescuers was apparent on 9/11, cleaning buildings, extinguishing fires, and saving the injured, often losing their own lives to save others.

Down the road, addiction gnawed into my life. Again, the frontline workers played pivotal roles in my self destructive behaviors. Some of those hospital visits I don’t remember, others I wished to forget. Even now, serving time in Federal Prison, there is one couple, once strangers to me, now close friends, who write others and myself, showing us we are not forgotten. It came as no surprise that one was a nurse, and both heavily involved in their religious community. This speaks to a different level, and some would say, a more significant form of rescuing.

In a full circle moment, we collectively have arrived at this once-in-a-century event: the Coronavirus Pandemic. If I could be on a balcony right now witnessing shift changes, as seen on the news, I’d applaud until my hands fell off for all the healthcare workers.

Many, myself included, have tested symptomatic positive for COVID, making me even more cognizant that medical personnel day in and day out, risk their lives to take care of us.

My question that I have pondered of late, how do I repay those who have rescued so many? I can go out and live a law abiding life; remain ever grateful for their sacrifices; and quite simply, don my mask out of respect for those who have dutifully rescued.
