Hi, my name is Sandy. This is the first day of my very first job. I’m so excited that I didn’t get any sleep last night--I hope it doesn’t show. I already tried on 6 outfits and hope this is the right one. I brushed my teeth twice, gargled three times, and now it’s time to hit the road. I have to get there early to make a good impression.

I am so nervous that I hope I don’t throw up.

The security guard asks for my name when I walk in so he could check a list, and I almost hope he doesn’t find it since I’m nervous. He found it so he gave me my name badge and took me to the elevator. My stomach turned as the doors opened, and as the man who interviewed me leads me to my cubicle, he welcomes me and tells me it’s ok to be nervous. He returns with a woman who would train me. I start to feel more comfortable, and when she asks me if I have any pictures, I show her a picture of my dog. She takes the photo and puts it on the wall with a piece of tape, “This is now your space to command.” She shows me everything I needed to know and her extension in case I need her. The next thing I know, my day is over. She took me out for a drink and asks me how the day was. “I will be a manager within a year.” Laughing, we drink some more. When I return to my apartment, I’ll collapse and worry about forgetting something the next day. However, I remember my trainer who’ll back me up, and so I go to sleep looking forward to the next day.

It’s been 10 years, and while I’m not the manager, I’m happy. That’s what counts, and so if you get a call asking you if you like your service provider and wish to change to ours, it may be my asking! So be nice when you tell me to go to blazes.
