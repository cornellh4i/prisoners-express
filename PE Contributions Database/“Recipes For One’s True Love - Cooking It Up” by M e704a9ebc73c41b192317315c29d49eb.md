**“Recipes For One’s True Love - Cooking It Up” by Mark Adam Peirano**

When we seek to meet someone new, especially when we arrange the meeting in-person for the first time via the internet, we each place ourselves, respectively, vulnerable to hurt, to coss, and to repeat the same risks again and again… searching for true love, for not every person we meet has the same concept of love, truth, or fairness. To many love, and true love, does not mean what it should, and therefore it can never last, and it can never be as fair as it must be to last. Wanting the true-love-that-lasts causes us to have to be informed about what love is, and what it isn’t. Let’s cook it up.

We are often tempted to think of love as the opposite of hate, as most would agree. However, the opposite of love is not hate; it is use. It is confusing to our spirits to be caught in this tangle of understandings, or misunderstandings, for - to be sure - before we can ever feel ‘hate’ for a person, we often most have “loved” them first, which is where I believe the tangle begins. This confusion inside us then predicates our spiral into misguided ideas about love, and we never consider that the opposite of love is use. When we love we don’t want so much to take but to give of ourselves - each of us. There are, however, those that only want the “trappings” of love; the idea of being loved is more powerful to them than the giving of themselves - so necessary for love to be real, true, and to last.

There are three ingredients to true love: admiring, desiring, caring. Only when these three are all together can a lasting relationship work out. One or two without the third will always end up cap-sizing and swink.

Think about the example of “a glutton loves his supper.” The desire part is there, but there is no admiring or caring for the supper once it is consumed - once it has been all used up. Use is the opposite of love, so it is easy to see how when desire is the only ingredient present in a relationship that things will, just as the glutton’s supper, eventually go down the drain, flush.

Think of another example, where a girl/boy “loves” a particular singer, dancer, actor, etc. In this “love” there is plenty of admiring, but not much, if any, caring. There may be desire, but the lack of caring leaves things only temporary. The singer/dancer/actor has no knowledge of the girl/boy “fan” that “loves” them. Nothing in this is destined to be long-term, for we each at one time or another favored a celebrity at one point, but later moved on to other things. We each, the celebrity (fame/fortune) and the fan got used out of that sort of “love, ”and use is the opposite of the kind of love, true love; we are each meant to seek in our lives.

The third mental/emotional exercise is to fonder the case of a man/woman donating to a charity, a soup kitchen, a homeless shelter, or some good person in need. There is plenty of caring, but less, or no, admiring and/or desirings. Charity and pity are good things, to be sure, but a relationship of true love cannot live on charity or caring alone. Even though it is necessary for charity and such, ultimately there is some dependent need on the fact that someone that request a donation, and some amount of use, though perhaps appropriate necessary, in this kind of relationship, and use is the opposite of the kind of true love we seek in meeting someone for the first time off of some internet site or app.

There are many combinations of these three ingredients for true love that exist in differing ratios for many types of human, and humane, love in the world, but, we must be able to identify each ingredient; admiring, desiring, caring in order to see when each is in the right balance, in both words and deeds, for ourself and for the other person with which we meet and plant the seeds of hope for true love. Life is full of lessons for each of us, and we can review each past relationship in our life and see which ingredients were out of-balancing; too much admiring on one person’s part, too much desiring on this other person’s part, not enough caring at other times. Reflection is good for healing your heart, take some time to think about these three ingredients in your future hopes for true love. We each hunger both to love and to be loved in return.

Admiring, desire, and caring - but never just using or being used - this is true love’s recipe. Get cooking.
