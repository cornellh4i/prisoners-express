**Nourishment by Richard Schmidlkofer**

What is nourishment? Is it only food, shelter and material things?

Is nourishment brought with love? If so thatâ€™s what I had.

Is nourishment getting beaten for just playing with the dog?

Is nourishment being alone when your mother watches soaps and your dad is at work all day? Is nourishment when your dad drinks his problems away?

Or is nourishment unconditional love with God? Or is nourishment when God is with you and will never leave you? Or is nourishment the Living Word word of God?

What is true nourishment?
