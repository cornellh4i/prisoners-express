**“Soaked” by David M. Brown**

Daddy Daddy come here, come here. I immediately jumped up and ran for the door since my daughter didn’t come all the way in. She busted in the door, called my name and sprinted back outside. It’s an emergency; I know that voice. I’m thinking a million thoughts and hoping with every letter that they’re ok. She and my grand-daughters were outside playing together in BackPlay. Oh, I forgot to tell you: I built a replica of my grand-daughters favorite playground In the back and I call It BackPlay. [We all love It.]

I get close to the door and almost trip because I'm running so fast. I pull out my cell phone ready to dial 9-1-1. I get out and “Splash”! My grand-daughters [Forever and Andraya] threw 2 buckets of water on me unannounced. I was in shock at what had just happened. I looked down at my clothes, my phone, then looked at my daughter. She was sitting at the gazebo smiling, shaking her head. I looked at my grand-daughters and took off running. When I turned around to look at them they were surprised that I didn’t chase them. Little did they know I was on my way to get the water blaster. That’s a new device I just bought yesterday, but I hadn’t hooked it up to the hose yet. I got it and put it in my pocket and walked past them. Their pales were empty.[Smiles Up] I got up to the water hose to grab it. They simultaneously said “You can’t catch us with that, Pa Pa”. I turned my back to them, put it on and turned around. Their eyes got big and their smiles got small. I turned it on; there was not one spot they could go that I didn’t spray them. Even when they eventually ran to Mom. I sprayed her too because she “set me up. Thanks to the water blaster I outsmarted the smart. Now who’s getting all wet?
