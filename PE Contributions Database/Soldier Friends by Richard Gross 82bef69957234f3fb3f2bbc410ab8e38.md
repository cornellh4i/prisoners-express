**"Soldier Friends" by Richard Gross**

Mother hates the noise of war. She is moaning as we shelter in this water-filled trench. I have to help her keep it together at times like these. Mother has never gotten used to the war, although it’s been going on most of her life.

My little son knows nothing else. He knows when we are afraid, but nothing bothers him. Maybe he isn’t yet aware of the danger. Maybe he just thinks that this is how the world is, occasional explosions and death. What an awful thought.

We are in this trench with our friends, the soldiers who are fighting to protect us. All of the soldiers are fighting to protect us, but we are not safe when they are fighting. Our village is a “strategic hamlet” and when the communists are around it must be defended. So they declare it a “fire free zone” and shoot at anything that moves, including our pigs which are the only things of value that we own. No one tells us when this zone has been declared. We find out from the noise, the explosions, or the screaming, or the rat-a-tat-tat of the machine guns.

When the communists are routed, the soldiers leave and then it is quiet and mother can smile again. It will be quiet for a while until the cycle is repeated.

All of the soldiers are our friends. When the communists are in our village, we are communists. That means that we share our food with them even though they give us nothing. When the capitalist soldiers are in our village, we are capitalists. That means we sell our food to them for a promise of reimbursement which never comes.

When the foreign soldiers are in our village, we are their friends too. They don’t want our food; they seem to want our young people. Our young ladies are popular with them and they give them gifts and make promises. Our young men are taken away and questioned to see if they are communists. They usually return beaten up. If the young men are not in the village when they come, that makes them think that we are all communists and that the young men are waiting to ambush them near the village. There is no telling what they will do in situations like that.

There are many different kinds of soldiers in this war: VC, ARVN, NVA, USMC, etc. They are all our friends, but I wish they would all die and not come to our village anymore!
