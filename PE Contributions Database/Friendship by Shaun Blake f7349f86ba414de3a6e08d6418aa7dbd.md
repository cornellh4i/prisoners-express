**"Friendship" by Shaun Blake**

Practical jokes don’t usually go over to well in a prison environment because of too much paranoia. The kind that does occur wouldn’t be appropriate for me to relate here--except one.

In 1998 I was housed in a mellow section, and everyone pretty much got along. My cellie became one of my best friends and still is to this day. I’ll refer to him here as DJ. We had another friend, Big Red, that liked to play practical jokes, and DJ was his favorite victim. Being gullible, it was easy to get DJ to cooperate. I was always entertained when around these two.

One day I was sitting at a section table watching TV with a bunch of guys when I noticed DJ getting into the shower. The showers are built for single occupancy, have no hooks to hang stuff off of, and has a door which is only solid across the middle for two feet with the bottom and the top open with bars so the guards could see through. Everyone uses the door’s bars to hang their stuff on, and DJ did the same as he entered. About 10 minutes later, Big-Red walks toward the showers, carrying a small box wrapped up like a gift and has a mischievous grin on his face. I forget about the TV as Big Red reaches the shower, gathers DJ’s stuff off the door and replaces it with the gift. He then walks to my table, takes a seat and tells us with an evil chuckle, “Watch this.”

DJ must’ve had his eyes shut because he didn’t react to the theft, until now. “Hey!” he calls, coming to the door, “Who stole my stuff? Bring it back!” When he spotted Big Red holding his things, he picks up the box and yells, “What the hell is this?”

“That’s your present,” Red answers with a smile. We’re all trying to hold straight faces, but it isn’t working.

“Come on damnit! Give me my stuff. I can’t get out with nothing to wear,” DJ yells, putting his “gift” down.

“You have something to wear. Open your present and see.” Red’s trying to look innocent. I wonder what could be wearable in that box? After more argument, DJ satisfies our curiosity and opens his present. Out falls a hot pink, Crochet g-string (Crochet is one of the authorized hobby-crafts).

Dropping the box and its contents, DJ backs away. He’s bright red with embarrassment. He glares at us all as we’re laughing so hard, “You F______ a__hole.” He yells at Red, “No way I’m wearing that!”

DJ and Red are going at it: DJ tries to get his things, and Red holds firm. DJ is also pleading with us all to help, but none of us will because this is just too funny. Finally with a lot of coaxing, we get DJ to put the g-string on--he stays in the shower though. (I wouldn’t have put it on if it were me). Red gets up after a while, takes DJ’s things to our cell, walks over to the shower, and *pulls the door open* before DJ can stop him. We’re all laughing so loud I’m surprised the guards don’t hear us. DJ stands there a moment, indecisive. The shower light illuminates him from above, showing his red hair and face, pale freckled skin, and chubby stomach and legs wrapped only in a hot pink crochet g-string. Suddenly, he bolts out the door, and as he turns toward our cell, his shower shoes slip out from under him. He crashes to the floor landing with a loud SPLATTT, sliding to a stop in front of me. He scrambles up and disappears into our cell with a huge round of applause, slamming the door behind him.

The dayroom is in an uproar with everyone laughing and congratulating Red on his successful practical joke. This continues most of the night, and DJ didn’t talk to Red for almost two weeks which for him, a long time to hold a grudge.

Ironic as this may sound, DJ kept the g-string. The last time I saw him was on the streets. While we were reminiscing, the subject came up then DJ goes into another room and returns with a clear plastic bag with a hot pink, crochet g-string inside. “It reminds me of Big Red,” he says showing me the bag. “He died after he got out.”
