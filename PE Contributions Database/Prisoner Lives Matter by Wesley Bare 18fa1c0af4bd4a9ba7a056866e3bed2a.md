**Prisoner Lives Matter by Wesley Bare**

A human being can be a prisoner of many different things. It don’t even have to be physical. It can be a traumatic memory or an addiction. I’m a prisoner with several different sentences.

I have been a prisoner of my own mind for quite some time. My Grandfather passed away a month before I turned twelve years old. I was his first born Grandson. He had a way of making me feel wanted and appreciated! When I lost him, I lost a part of myself. I started to act out in school and at home just to be noticed. I was looking for the role models in all the wrong places. Even contemplated suicide, but never made any attempts. Made a few small cuts with a dull knife just to feel something. I learned to express myself through music and girls telling me I was cute!

I’ve spent a lot of time in juvenile facilities and prisons when I became of age for numerous crimes that funded my lifestyle and addictions. I smoked marijuana and drank liquor to escape my reality. I was never taught how to deal with my emotions.

I was released from prison after doing seven years. Sixty-seven years later, my Mother passed away due to stage three lung cancer. The day she passed was the first time I used methamphetamine. Soon after that I was taught to make my own. My life was in a spiral. Then on December 1st, 2014 my Uncle was giving my sister, her boyfriend, my best friend, and myself to my nephew’s (my sister’s son’s) sixth birthday party and we were in an accident that claimed the lives of my little sister, her boyfriend, and my best friend. Thankfully, I was arrested two days later for aggravated possession of meth and trafficking marijuana. I didn’t get to attend any of the funerals, but I wasn’t convicted of the charges either. Someone was looking out for me because I was very unpredictable. They say if it's too much to bear, then give it to God. I’ve tried that, but can you imagine an eight year old asking you to explain to him how his mother was killed? I did the best I could. It wasn’t easy!

He’s my favorite person in this world. I was forced to take a hard look at myself, to break this “vicious cycle” before my nephew is consumed by it. I’ve grown up tremendously in the last three years I’ve been incarcerated. The only way I feel I can lead a productive life and truly be at peace with myself is by helping others. Especially the kids, because they are the future! Thinking of where I come from, what I can do to help, and how I want to be remembered when I’m gone helps me get my bearings and get going.

When I looked at the picture of the man at the edge of the cave, facing the exit, I automatically thought of where I’m at in life. I’m ready to shed some light! Exiting my mental prison. It may take me a few more years before I’m released from my physical prison, but I’m going to use this time wisely. I’m going to keep creating ideas, setting goals, and establishing positive contacts. I have a story to tell that I think will help some people and this is only the beginning of it! I have some ideas for starting charity events to do things for the children in the community. Help unfortunate people find jobs, even creating jobs and other opportunities. I know what it feels like to feel like everyone has given up on me. I also know what it feels like to be blessed with someone who is willing to help when nobody else would give me a chance, and how good it made me feel! Like I got a second wind in a long race. I have more than a few ideas.

I want to do something with my life that matters. Even if it’s nothing more than being a positive role model for my nephew. He’s getting ready to be twelve years old on December First! It will also be six years since the accident, which is also the date that this writing is due and I think that’s why it stood out to me so much!

A quote that stuck with me,

“I don’t know how things will turn out, but it is only through fearless engagement that we can know our own limits”!
