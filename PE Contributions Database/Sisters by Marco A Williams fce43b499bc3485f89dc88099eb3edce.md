**Sisters by Marco A. Williams**

I may seem to dwell in the realm of fantasy when I describe my sisters to you. Yet rest assured, it is all really and unfortunately true.

I have 2 big or older sisters. First I will ease your mind with the good sister.

Sam is medium build about 5’10” light mahogany with a beautiful body and wonderful mind. Sam is the kind of sister I believe all men should have. She is kind, never lies on you or about you. Don’t gossip. She’s the lady that hands out candy in the neighborhood to all of the kids who just knocks on the door or see her on her porch. She is always cheerful and maintains a good heart in the face of adversity.

To give you a quick bio so that you may understand a little about my sister.

Sam has been shot with a mack 10 by her boyfriend, she has been in a terrible car wreck that messed up her face, (which healed surprisingly well), contracted HIV by another boyfriend, has Lupus and miscarried her first child which was being developed in her fallopian tube and had to get a hysterectomy and was betrayed for the final time by the evil one. (I’ll get to that in a minute). And yet, she is still a happy person will give you her last dime and is very mild tempered. Sam is truly a good sister and a christian.

Now, Sophia is the oldest of us and the biggest. She is pretty and very light skinned. Almost the same complexion as my mother and my mother is Sicilian and black. But that is where her beauty ends.

She ran away at 13. And smashed my mother in the face with a coka cola bottle. Mother forgave her. At 17 she was pregnant and Mom let her stay at home and she stole money and jewelry. Then later she called H.R.S. on my mother claiming that my mom was molesting my little brothers. Then she did the same to two of my aunts and uncle and me. Fortunately, nothing came of either accusation.

Her name among the family is “the evil one” I have letters from family to verify this. She is the embodiment of evil. She is the kind of woman whom if she doesn’t get her way with you, she will make life difficult for you. The things she do is quite inventive. She may somehow get ahold of your info and put bills or credit cards in your name. She may play nice until you let her borrow something expensive then she’ll claim she lost it or that you owe her it. One time, her cousin was evicted and needed a place to stay. At this time, the evil one didn’t have much furniture in her house. So she told her cousin that she could bring her furniture to her house and that she could stay there until she get her a place.

After I helped her cousin move into the evil ones house. Two days, two DAYS, goes by when the evil one put her out and kept ALL of her property claiming that her cousin owed her some money. The woman looked at me in a pleading manner and asked if I could do something. I told her I couldn’t do anything. And she left with unshed tears in her eyes and the look of unbridled hatred. I never saw the cousin again.

Sam is the forgiving type. The evil one has done much wrong to Sam, too much to fill these pages. However, Sam has always forgiven her until the summer of 2015.

Sam goes home to Detroit every year up until this point. Although Sam returns broke and a little miserable with every visit, she in her happy enthusiasm stays with the evil one every time she visit.

This time however was bad.

The evil one has a little get-together at her house and invited a few old and new associates. Then she started bad mouthing Sam. Sam defended herself and bad mouthed her back. Except the Sam bad mouthed her with truth, the evil one got upset, she can cry at will, and swung on Sam hitting her in the face in front of everyone. Sam not being a fighter or a cryer, went and packed her things and put them in her rental car. Sam did not return.

Upon returning to California, Sam changed all of her numbers and social media accounts. And the evil one was trying to find avenues to apologize at first and then with no response from Sam, she used harassment. None worked and Sam finally found a reason not to forgive.

Sam was the last link the evil one had to our family. And she messed that up with her own selfish stupidity.

The evil one, due to the fact that she has the ability to cry at will, many naive people believe her stories and accusations. The strange thing is, with all the many accusations of child abuse and rape, of her and her two daughters, no one has been to court or prison. No one. Everything dissolved into nothing but hatred towards her.

Sisters.

Many may have one or some. And they all come in all shapes, sizes, and personalities. Yet mine are at the extreme of both ends of the good and evil spectrum. And truth be told I only love one of my sisters. And the other, I feel nothing.
