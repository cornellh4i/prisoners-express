***Better* by Richard Gross**

****Grandparents are just plain better than parents. They love you more and punish you less. They praise you more and criticize you less. They’re always happy to see you and like to give you stuff. They think you’re great even if your parents consider you a gigantic disappointment. Grandparents want to be asked about their grandchildren more than about their children.

Grandparents have seen a whole lot in their life and have a better understanding of the Big Picture. They know what is important and what is trivial. For many parents, everything is a big huge deal. Everything is something they've never seen or the worst they’ve ever seen.

The best thing about grandparents is that they have seen your own parents at their worst. They have seen your parents doing the same things as you and maybe much worse. Grandparents have seen it all. God bless them.
