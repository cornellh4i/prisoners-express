**“(Word Theme) Keeping Calm” by Efren Hawkins**

Through life, keeping calm has been one of my biggest struggles. I’m quick tempered and have been this way since I was about six years old. This is what has got me into so much trouble through my life. Today, I try my best to stay calm, because most situations will blow by. Boy, when they do, I realize they are worth what I plan to do.

Music really keeps me calm, because it sometimes takes me to another time in my life. It removes me from this confine and places me in my journey of life, which was a wonderful time. Much of the time, listening to music blocks out all the goings on around me. Headphones are a blessing, because you can lay back and place yourself on stage in your own concert where you are the star. Each song is a message to you as it removes you from a dark place and lights up the stage for you.

Life is a song worth singing. So, let’s sing it to the fullest no matter your situation, and you can make it through. It’s easy to be hyped up and off the chain. But, it’s hard to be calm and relax,l until you see it’s less stressful, and enjoyable. When you keep calm you see life better, and you don’t see it moving by so fast. Life is beautiful and wonderful to live if you take your time to live it.

So, keeping calm can help you find those moments, people and things that gave you all those enjoyable parts of life, which shows you it wasn’t as bad as you thought. Find your inner strength and give thanks for the new you.
