**by Jeremy Dunlap**

In the mountains of North Carolina, there is a town named Old Fort. If you don’t know where that is don’t worry, nobody else does either. It’s a town with a population of “not-many” and a tourist destination of “even-less”. Yet it has all the amenities of modern life: a couple gas stations, two stoplights, a McDonalds and a Hardees which compete as “fancy eat in” places, and if you drive back in the woods a ways you’ll find the Old Fort Golf Course. I lived there with my parents, our house overlooking the fourth fairway of the little nine-hole course. It’s also where I got my first real job. It was September 1996. I was sixteen and in desperate need of more disposable income than my weekly chore allowance for urgent reasons such as gas money, video game money, and money to spend on girls. I didn’t want to work at McDonalds or Hardees and I figured that if I worked at the golf course then not only could I just walk to work, I probably wouldn’t work *that* hard right? Wrong. So, *so* wrong.

“Quaint” is a good word to describe that place. The clubhouse is two stories of brick and wood, the bottom floor taken up by a diner-esque grill on one side and a small store that sold clubs, t-shirts, visors and other golfing paraphernalia on the other side. Upstairs was a place for parties, as long as the parties weren’t too big. Out front was a putting green so small that it was probably laughed at by individual holes at a miniature golf course, but you could putt for free--can’t beat free.

It’s a pretty place though. There are winding cart paths around well maintained fairways and greens. Plenty of oaks for shade, a stream that runs down between the first and ninth fairways which leads to the course’s single water hazard; a small pond with a few ducks, bullfrogs big enough that the sound like cannonballs when they hit the water, and shopping turtles that would routinely emerge from the depths to wreak havoc on the poor ducks. All of that surrounded by woods and hills, very quaint.

I was hired to work on Fridays from four in the afternoon to six in the evening, and Saturday through Sunday from six-in-the-morning until two in the afternoon. My duties were to mow the greens, rake the sand traps, fill and replace the water coolers, weedeat, unplug the electric carts, and basically do everything. All for minimum wage.

So early in the mornings I’d walk down to the clubhouse and unplug the golf carts from their charging ports. The plug-ins were in the rafters of an awning to one side of the clubhouse, and were also like high-rise apartments for spiders. Getting covered in webs probably isn’t that big of a deal for someone who isn’t arachnophobic. I however am arachnophobic. I wonder all these years later what the people whose houses were closest to the clubhouse thought of the shrieking and cursing that came from there early on weekends? Probably the same thought they had about the shrieking and cursing when I had to plug the carts back up in the afternoons.

Raking sand traps was a zen experience. There’s a technique to it where you rake it loose and smooth it out in the same back-and-forth motion and you get this rhythm going, and even though your hands are blistering and you’re sweating like a beast, it doesn’t seem so hard. Until zen is broken by raking up dog crap, a dead opossum, or diving out of the way of the golf ball whacked at you by the guy who looked right at you and did it anyway. Then it’s back-and-forth, Grasshopper, back-and-forth.

I learned things though, like the reason all greens have a checkered appearance is because each day I had to mow them in a different direction, kinda like a compass. I also learned that an engineering maniac must have designed the mower because while it was self-propelled if I cranked the throttle fully I could sprint behind it. Who needs turbo on a walk-behind mower? And yes, I did try it. It was fun, and pissed off my boss, but worth it.

It was hard work. Much tougher than any fast-food restaurant, but despite that I ended up enjoying it. The rafter-spiders and I came to an uneasy truce, I loved working outside even on cold days, plus I’d get a free lunch at the grill, and at sixteen a free cheeseburger is like gold...greasy, delicious gold. School demands, extracurricular activities, and other teenage reasons had me seeking other employment, but it was a good first job. Except for those spiders.
