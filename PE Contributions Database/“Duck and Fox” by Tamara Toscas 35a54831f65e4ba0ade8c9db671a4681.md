**“Duck and Fox” by Tamara Toscas**

(must use British accent)

“And aren’t you just the cutest chap! Hello fellow furry feathered friend, who is it you are carrying on with, might I ask? Oh, they are your babies, how stinkin’ adorable. Fun, fun!”

As it does seem a might windy, may I assist you in getting to your destination, my new ducky friend?

Looking around us, your basket is quite the antique, the buildings aged and with character. I believe this era to fit us nicely and though I am young and able, I can appreciate the wisdom of our surroundings.

I think it is a beautiful love affair, “time and wisdom”.

How about us set off on our own journey, yes? I’ll warn you beautiful duck, I can be a chatter box but really, I’m just full of joy and inspired by life and its beauty.

Where are your wings, friend? Did the good Lord decide you did not need them? Well, it’s no bother because it’s your day to be blessed because I’ve been sent to be your very own “Foxy Angel” - laugh out loud - not only do foxes have fur but your fox has wings as well. I will share mine with you today. I love good friends and you’re very nice so, where would you like to go?

The wind, do you feel the wind on your face? It reminds me of heaven. It is how the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, wonders around heaven. Surely, it is a beautiful feeling that Joy, as a rushing wind, straight to the heart. Oh boy, this Journey, our little talk makes me so full of Joy and happiness.

I love your smile, duck friend!

Please don’t ever stop smiling and thinking happy thoughts. Did you know, our Father, heavenly Father says if we just put our minds to having a friendship with Him, He will take care of everything in our lives?

Let me grab my sunglasses friend, as the Spirit can be quite the Jokester running round and round like the wind is now making us close our eyes as if we were praying to Father… sneaking lil Spirit He is.

Alright now, I am ready for our Saint. Can I tell you a joke? Laughter is one of the best medicines on Earth.

Ducky, how do you catch a unique rabbit? Unique up on it! HAHA

I Quack me up. Get it “Quack me up”? I thought you would like that one.

Oh, oh I know what I would like to do now, may I sing to your babies? Amazing Grace, I love songs of lost and found.

Let’s bring a little bit of heaven dwn, do you mind, new friend?

I am sure Father would be happy with me for that and I have one more question for you my extraordinary friend, the most important question of all: Do you know Jesus?

He is the most amazing man and majestic Father and I would love more than anything on this earth, to share Him with you.

He will help you find joy in every situation in life, if you will allow me to tell you about Him?

Heaven is for real, and so is my love for you, friend.
