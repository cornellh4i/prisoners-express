In the old days school was an actual job. Kids today are ungrateful for how easy they have it. Kids today can have all their textbooks on a one pound tablet computer. In the old days I had to carry eight textbooks to school everyday that weighed about a total of thirty pounds.

In the old days homework meant going to the library every night. Dad would get home from work and drive me straight to the library. He ate dinner in the car while I inside reading books and reference materials. In the old days we didn't have the internet. The library computers only had word processing, no internet. I would type my homework and pay twenty five cents for each page. Today kids have all the information of the world through the internet or their cell phones.

In the old days teachers actually taught and students actually had to pay attention and take notes in order to pass the class. If your grades got too low they would take you out in the hallway and give you the paddle to knock some sense into you. Teachers today don’t care and are all burned out. They pass everybody and don’t care if students cheat off another's papers.
