"Inside There’s a Beautiful Cacophony" by Dexter Rabadan

Rain slicked benches offered seats for the weary along the street. The storm had come and gone overnight; lazy puddles of water refusing to move on. The warm damp air nestled into every crevice on the body. Summer lingers, but not for long.

The leggings, the jorts, the bangs; evasive fashion, not of this time. She had skipped breakfast in favor of a walk. Past the turnpike, the laundromat, and so on. The rain had seemingly kept copious streets slightly empty on this Sunday morning, but those who could not rest were about: the butcher, the garbage hauler, patrolman. These working men brought forth a discordant cacophony to the passerby.

She was not a passerby. She was not busy with her own doings. She did not belong to the passerbys, nor the working men, she did not belong to anything. The checking off boxes need not apply. She was shy, a lack of social gatherings was not to blame, she scarcely had anything to say. What was there to say?

The follies and the intricacies of microcosms of life entertained and intrigued her. She did not understand the frenzy over money. These observances of the microcosms and their dwellers called for little to no effort on her part rendering money useless.

All she had to do was look and listen. The crunch of most gravel under rolling tires. An old Italian man heading into the bodega and exiting with coffee steadied in hand and the Times folded and pinned underarm. She would watch him. She would playout fictional scenarios of what laid ahead for him: an early morning mistress who loved the Sunday crossword but hated coffee, she tolerated his drinking of it, and so on, until he was down the pavement and out of sight.

The sudden chill brought her out of her reverie. Exhausted from her wandering, and wondering, she headed home. Dog-walkers, taxi cabs, joggers, the working men; the puddles had dried; the streets were teeming with movement, with noise, with smell.

Up the staircase she went. In front of the door she fumbled for the keys. She opened the door slowly, expectantly. The non-descript couch in the common room and the faded water stained, oak dining table with unmatching chairs in the kitchenette were her only guests.

Down the hall she went. The smell of old carpet was heavy on her nose, she had not vacuumed in weeks. She entered the bathroom intent on a wash. Off came the leggings, off came the jorts, the panties, the wristlets, the blouse, the bra; off came the nonessentials. Along with the wig.

She stood in front of the mirror observing; small breasts with dark protruding nipples, flat undefined stomach whose navel was allotted with a thin patch of dark pubic hair aligning with her pelvis. Slowly her arms lifted from waists length and her fingers traced the underneath of her breasts. The feeling of the firm mass present in her left breast was unsettling but not unfamiliar. She worked her hands up onto the baldness of her head.

Tears fell down her cheeks, down the valley of her breasts and came to puddle in her pubic hair. As the rain, this to would dry. This to would pass with time.

She thought of the working men; the butcher, the garbage hauler, and so on...She thought of the sun; rising-falling-rising-falling...She thought of the clouds, of the rain, of Sundays. Eternal play of day.

She thought of the old man, making his way to his mistress. His ascent up the stairs was a balancing act; the Times and the coffee were to precious to go tumbling down. She thought of the mistress, standing in the doorway eager to greet him, to love him.

And somewhere deep down in the subconscious; beneath the skull, beneath the brain tissue; resided an unanswered scenario: does his mistress wear a wig?
