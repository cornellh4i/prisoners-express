**“Straight Laced” by LeRoy Sodorff**

A wanton woman

All dressed in lace

Seeks a familiar face

Lost in the crowd

With a determined look

And disparate eyes

She steps out into the fray

Oblivious to all those passerby

Who port the way

She suddenly eyes the target

Of her heart’s desire

That fuels the rage

And lights the fire

At this preemptive stage

Now there on the pier

Her lover crosses the line

And before she could think

He goes into a dive

And lands in the drink!!
