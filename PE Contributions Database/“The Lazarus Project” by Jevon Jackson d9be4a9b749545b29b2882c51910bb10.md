**“The Lazarus Project” by Jevon Jackson**

Jordan sat in the brown leather chair with no armrests as he halfheartedly flipped through a TIME magazine in the waiting area of Dr. Alcott’s office. The small room was brightly lit and smelled like fresh cinnamon raisin bagels. There were only two other people waiting, probably waiting to see one of the other psychologists.

Tossing the magazine on the table, Jordan sighed and stared at the framed poster that hung on the wall across from him. The poster with the adult hands cradling an infant, the tiny soles of baby feet faced out, with the words “A Better You” emblazoned in white cursive font at the bottom. It was a highly popular campaign ad for The Lazarus Project. If you wanted to, literally, start your life over as a baby, they now had the capabilities to do it. Jordan knew all about it because his father, Paul, a genetic engineer, worked for HaloGenic Industries and had been working on The Lazarus Project for years.

His father explained to him how it was a monumental leap beyond cloning, how it was more of a miracle evolution in science, technology, and human nature. To begin life again, anew, while retaining your unique individual self, your personality, your spirit, your YOUness that makes you who you are, and simultaneously removing any genetic predispositions to diseases or hereditary ailments. It was the old you born into a new genetically modified body.

Some people, like those afflicted with terminal cancers, praised it as a godsend, while others, usually the religious zealots, called it an abomination to God. Because of so much initial public resistance to the project, it took over 20 years, and millions of dollars in lobbying from HaloGenic Industries, before the U.S. government approved what was now called “new-birth.” Jordan’s mother, Cathy, an oncologist at a local hospital, thought The Lazarus Project and the “new-birth” movement had become too commercialized, too profit-driven. He got a kick out of watching them -- his mother and father -- have animated debates at the dinner table over the issue. Although they weren’t his biological parents, they always treated him with unconditional love as if he were their own flesh and blood. They were the only parents he knew, and even after 14 years, still, he felt like he didn’t belong.

Suddenly, there was a loud commotion from behind the door where the hallway to the individual offices was located. It sounded like arguing. The door flung open and a guy in his early 20’s stormed out into the waiting area. He had short snow white hair and a red mangled scar cascading down his neck.

“I’m just sick of all the fuckin’ lies!” he yelled out behind him, and quick, out the main door he went. Dr. Alcott, in her black elegant heels, swiftly followed behind him. Within a minute or two, Dr. Alcott was back in the waiting area, apologizing to everyone there for the disturbance. After quietly conferring with the receptionist behind the desk for a few moments, she motioned for Jordan to follow her.

Jordan had been seeing Dr. Alcott since he was seven years old. Before that, it was Dr. Benjamin. For as long as he could remember, he had always seen a psychologist on a regular basis, sometimes two or three times a week. It didn’t seem odd to him until earlier that year, when his friends from middle school expressed how weird it was that a kid would need to see a shrink that often. Jordan began to suspect that his parents were hiding something from him, especially since the vivid dreams continued to become more frequent. It wasn’t any disconnected, bizarre stuff that he dreamed about; it was constant, clear, lucid dreams about two or three different people whom he had never met before.

Dr. Alcott wanted to discuss the dreams today, but Jordan had grown leery of her also. So, he lost himself into her bright hazel eyes and made some stuff up until their session was over. He had to figure this out on his own. Something huge was being hidden from him. He suspected that something really tragic happened to his childhood.

As Jordan rode the city bus back home, he stared out the window, listening to his hip-hop playlist through his earbuds and trying to piece the puzzles of his dreams together. Just then, the guy with the snow-white hair, who stormed out of Dr. Alcott’s office earlier, sat down next to him. Jordan removed his earbuds as the guy glanced at him nervously. Looking straight ahead, the guy spoke low but forcefully, “They’ve been lying to us, man.”

“S’cuse me?” Jordan said, staring at the guy’s burn scars on his neck.

“This Lazarus Project bullshit.” Now, the guy was looking directly into Jordan’s eyes. “We were the experiments. The first group of new-births. The dreams -- you keep having vivid dreams, right? -- those are memories from your previous life. We’ve got real families out there that we don’t even know about.”

Jordan just sat there, quiet, taking it in. The puzzle pieces were finally beginning to merge together.
