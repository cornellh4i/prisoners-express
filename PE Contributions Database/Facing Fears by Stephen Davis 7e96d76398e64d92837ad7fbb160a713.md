****The more I examine my life in its entirety, the more I recognize how much fear and feelings of being afraid have influenced my thoughts and decisions. As a preteen, fear of getting beatings by an abusive parent or fear of not knowing how I would survive my next encounter with the neighborhood bully, was the beginning of living with the kind of distress that would affect my thoughts for many years to come.

There was fear in the form of shyness as I stood frozen, unable to get the nerve to speak to the girl that I liked so much. Maybe that was rooted in my fear of not wanting anyone to know how poor we were, or to make fun of me because of it.

Becoming reckless and rebellious as a teen was fueled by a need to escape my fears. I thought that the crazier I acted, the more fearless I would become, but in reality, I would become more and more of an example of all those things that I once hated and despised in others. It was the anger and pain of that scared and troubled boy lashing out, wanting to get even for all the misery that he had suffered.

I eventually found myself on a path of darkness and self-destruction, wandering in a fog of intoxication, and caught within the clutches of crime, wallowing in self-pity and watching my potential go down the drain of low self-esteem. And like a runaway train, I only picked up momentum as I headed toward what would be a very tragic outcome.

Walking into the penitentiary became the perfect grounds to get further away from the person I was trying to escape from. The person that had let me down more than anyone, although I continued to place the blame elsewhere. The person I could no longer recognize when I looked in the mirror, seeing only the image that my fears had produced: a grotesque mask, filled with as much self-loathing as it was unbridled hostility toward a world in which I never felt like I quite belonged.

It wasn’t until after I had spent more of my life in the confines of a cage than I had as a free man living and walking in society, that I began to face those demons within me which were the accumulation of my fears. I began to peel back all those layers that had been used to cover up my vulnerability and insecurities. Slowly and gradually, my true self/spirit began to emerge.

Today, there is the occasional worry or apprehension about one thing or the other. The difference now is that I know how to face them and get to the root of the issues before they can become anything more than a passing anxiety. I stop letting my fears become greater than the circumstances which cause them. Now I am able to face life’s challenges with the confidence and certainty of knowing I am equipped with a very strong determination and resolve.

Facing and overcoming my fears have been the most liberating of feelings. They enabled me to channel my thoughts and emotions in ways and to places that have help me expand as a human being. I have been able to use past experience to glean wisdom from life lessons while I use new experiences as an opportunity to gain fresh perspectives. I am so humbled by what I have made it through and how far I’ve come. And I know none of it would have been possible if I didn’t have the courage to step beyond the boundaries of my fears.
