**Keep at it, Slugg-er by Nate Lindell**

There have been times that I’ve felt like I was flying, such as once when I did some great LSD. The problem is … you will land. Landing can be an m-f-er.

Surely I won’t be the only one to write about this. The trough in pleasure’s wave?

I now strive to keep in mind the Enlightened one’s teachings: don’t become attached to pleasure or pain. This, when I succeed, gives me peace that I see most around me lack. (Yep, I’m a Buddhist, but, as Mel Gibson said in Air America, “I never said I was a good Buddhist!”)

Following the 8-fold Noble path is my aim, and helping others is my favorite fold; it gives me a calm pleasure to help others, and the “weird” thing I’ve discovered about doing so is that … sometimes others help me, that others want to be around me, even though I look like a psycho killer (“technically”, I am a psycho killer).

Consider my suggestion, try helping someone, even if you are a psycho killer. Mix it up a bit, blow some minds.

Keep at it slugg-er. :) (you know, like a slug, slow, but persistently, yet with less slime.)

Namaste.
