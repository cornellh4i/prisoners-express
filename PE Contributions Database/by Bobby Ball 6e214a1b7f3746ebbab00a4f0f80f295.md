**By Bobby Ball**

Verbal velocity validate your vibrations

With penetration you in the big leagues now

These streets are true torture

So forever Iâ€™m scorch the pavement with my anger forgive me

The secret to living is giving

Tormented spirits tested by temptations Tricky Business

Tears of urban compassion cradles the community

No pain no profit povertyz perfume
