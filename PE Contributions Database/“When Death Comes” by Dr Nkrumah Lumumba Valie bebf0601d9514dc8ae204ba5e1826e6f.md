**“When Death Comes” by Dr. Nkrumah Lumumba Valier**

From the start, I knew that this day would come. As sure as we are born someday we will all die. Like all of Allah's creations, we have a specified time decreed to live. And to fulfill our destinies. This life I only have one, had I been born a cat I would’ve had nine lives if that saying is true. So many mistakes I’ve made along the way. I wished that I never made it. I am not a bad person at heart but made some bad choices in my life. My desires were untamed wild like a lion in the jungle, a king, the ruler of my kingdom. I ruled as far as you could hear my roar.

I felt love that made me happy and love that made me feel pain. How could one woman affect my heart in such a way? She made me feel things I never felt before. Mentally, emotionally and physically every time I penetrated her body. We became one of our souls mates, completed degrees in love. Completely under her control like Eve had Adam. My thoughts envisioned this feeling would last forever. But nothing in our lives lasts forever. And so that day came, Doris said that she does not love me anymore. I felt the first crack enter my heart like an elephant just sit down on hand mirror. From the weight, my heart shattered in a billion micro pieces. I can’t feel the beat of my heart beating up against my chest anymore. It’s getting harder for me to breathe. Those words are more powerful than any weapon of mass destruction. Doris completely disappeared out of my life. Like she was never real and only a part of my imagination.

I never remembered ever feeling this sad. I can’t remember ever crying so hard in my life. My mind was so confused in pain. How can I live without Doris and she is my life? These thoughts clutter my mind I know it is not the answer. But I want the pain to stop cause I can’t live another day feeling like this. I pick up my 9mm and place it to my head with my iPhone in the other hand. At the same time, I took the selfie (picture) of myself. I pulled the trigger. So when they show Doris the picture, she can see how much I truly loved her.

Death came down from heaven and cradled me in its arms singing a lullaby song the same on my mother used to sing to me when I was a baby. I could hear death’s every word it said to me as it whispered softly into my ear holding me close to it. Death said: “Child of our father Allah. Why did you do this to yourself? Only if you had been a little more patient because Allah made Doris leave so that He could send the woman who was actually meant for you. Catherine LaFleur was on her way, it was meant for yall to meet tomorrow. She had been praying for you for a long time, but you were with Doris and could not hear what Allah was saying to you the entire time. But don’t worry when Catherine hears about what happened to you. She will follow you into heaven, I am scheduled to get here in two days. Only had you been a little more patient and waited on your true love, Catherine LaFleur.”

Death placed his hand upon my forehead and allowed me to see the life I would’ve had with my true soulmate. My soul left my body more sad than it had been when I was alive because I seen how Catherine ended her life. And her last words was “I will always love you Nkrumah.” Death carried me up to heaven in his arms.
