**Flying by Cesar Hernandez**

We are free up to the point of choice, then the choice controls the chooser.

Our success in life is determined by the choices we make. You are going to be making choices that will determine your success as you learn to be making choices that will determine your success. You learn to manage yourself and others. To be effective in making proper choices, you must understand the difference between reacting and responding.

My wife and I fly to visit her friend for the week. On the last day we decide at exactly one that we needed to go to the airport now. We have a three pm departure time and need to hurry. The two of us make a mad dash for the airport which is a thirty minute trip from downtown.

We pull into the airport at exactly two pm. There are two long lines, we select the shortest. One of the ticket agents is walking around behind the counter. I mentally and physically get ready to make a quick dash to the counter when she opens up the third line. In a matter of minutes she walks over to the Closed sign and flips it to open. She smilingly announces to the group, “Those of you on the three pm flight, come here.”

I run to her position and am first in line. She says, “The three pm flight has been cancelled.” I enthusiastically respond, fantastic! She is puzzled and asks, “Why do you say fantastic when I just said the three pm flight is canceled?” I smile and say, there are only three reasons why anybody is going to cancel a flight. One, something is wrong with the plane; two, something is wrong with the pilot; three, something is wrong with the weather they are flying the airplane in. If any one of those three situations exists, I don’t want to be up there. I want to be down here. Fantastic!

To my response, the ticket agent says “The next flight doesn’t leave until 6 pm.” I reply Fantastic! The agent says, “why would you say fantastic when I just said you have a four hour wait in the Kansas City airport?” I reply. In all my years of living, never before in my life do I get the chance to spend four hours in the Kansas City airport. At this moment there are tens of millions of people on earth who are cold and hungry. I am here in a beautiful facility, even though it’s cold outside, it’s comfortable inside. Down the corridor is Starbucks. I am going to go down there, relax for a few minutes, and enjoy a latte. Then I have extremely important work that I need to do. I am here in one of the nicest buildings in the area. It is the biggest, comfortable, rent-free office I have at my disposal! Fantastic!

I can choose to respond-which is positive-or I can choose to react-which is negative I choose to respond.

At the airline counter, I have a choice. I can rant and rave. I can choose to react and the next flight still leaves at six pm.

You can watch a person go about their daily activities for days or weeks and learn a great deal about them. However, you can watch a person under adverse circumstances for five minutes and see whether they have learned to respond or to react. Actually, you can learn more about them in a few minutes under trying conditions than you can in days of just watching them involved in daily activities.

Your response-or reaction-to the negative reveals what’s inside of you. It exposes your heart and shows the kind of person you really are. The problem is that most people have a tendency to react instead of respond and blame everything and everybody for their difficulties in life.
