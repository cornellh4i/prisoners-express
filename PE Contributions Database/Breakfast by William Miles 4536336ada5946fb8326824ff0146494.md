**"Breakfast" by William Miles**

Barkarna sat north an ancient olive tree, birds twittering overhead, some pecking at the still unripe fruit, sunlight passing through the intertwining branches painted playful shadows across her small thighs, she only five years old would hopefully grow to be as beautiful as her mother Falerna, while Falerna was a proper Italian wife for the year of 412 Anno Domini, her second oldest daughter showed a terrible streak of independence, in spite of this flaw, her husband never mentioned regret at accepting his raven haired child soon nicknamed Vashti by a Saracen business man.

A large shadow formed over, blocking the shadow she so loved, Vashti looked up to see, Claudio Felix in his blue tunic looming over her, left side of his face a mess of tangled scars where a former exceptionally master "punished" Claudi, for his audacity in allowing his garun to cool too much. "Good Morning, little shadow mistress." This greeting very much delighted Vashti, she kept up, hands on hips, her head tilted to one side "And what do you have for me, Claudio Felix?" He smiled at her lock of impetuous impatience, "but only a bit of bread and chilled goat milk, my dear child." This was said with a conspiring wink, and he sat and offered to feed her. And of course, as she was habit to, she gleefully accepted offering a bit to the birds as well.

The clatter of utensils broke her reserve. Our "lady of sorrows" aka Vashti so less than civilized eating by "silverware" not as in her days as a living woman of 3 and 20 years, still her last breakfast burned bright, over 1000 near to 1600 years ago, honeyed bread with pork, wine to wash it all down.

About Roma year 430 A.D. her guard following close to a lantern bearer, a boy of 9 seasons. He and the guard both wore blue tunic, both slave Claudio Felix though 18 years older chose to remain close, he served her breakfast until she awoke to find herself cold with breathless speech and cursed, cursed in human beauty, yet gave no reflection, none at all. So turning towards the battered table deep in her fortified palace, Vashti made her way from the balcony overlooking the valley, to steal a bite, the blood which carved the flavor of her ghouls breakfast, as she pronounced it, savory sausage, orange juice, has browns, and bacon. Her ghoul startled by this unforeseen though welcome show of affection, while Zurve and Zara ignored Roxy what could a ghoul of 30 years know, considering the knowledge of 2 1000+ ghouls, foolish girl. Roxy smiled as Liam glared at her.
