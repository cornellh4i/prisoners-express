**“MY BODY” by Bruce Willcoxen**

I must first tell you John’s story. I first met John in 1965, (where I spent 13 months with him, then from January 1969 through August 1975, then the last four years of his life, from May 1982 through October 1986).

We had become friends over these years. John was born March 11, 1945 and no one wanted him. Although he spent most of his life in different institutions he was very compassionate and harbored no hatred. He was two years older than me.

When on October 3rd, 1986, John died. I wanted to find a way to say “goodbye” to my friend in a way that would let him know how much he meant to me and how many lives he had touched.

He was well liked by inmates, as well as staff, so I had no problem putting together a plan. Knowing that he would be in a pauper's grave, at the back of a cemetery, with only a brass maker, I wanted anyone that saw his headstone to know that he was something that was known and loved.

My first obstacle was getting past the “DOC” policy about inmates transferring funds to each other. After securing permission, and being told to work with the Chaplain, I started soliciting money from his circle of close friends, then from anyone, for a donation for a headstone. Through my effort I raised $376. The Chaplain told me that after 32 years in DOC, this was a first that he knew of.

It was through my association with John that I had changed my attitude. You may be asking, “What does this have to do with ‘My Body’?” Bear with me, here’s my story.

I just turned 72 and having spent some 50 years in some sort of institution, the last 37.8 here. At first I was angry and blamed everyone for me not being free. After I turned 70, I have been thinking, “Is there anything positive that I can do to make up for all the lost years of my life”? Recently I discovered YES there is, I can donate my body to science. I do not want the burden of $3000-$4000 on my family, and it would be a waste, like the last 50 years, for the state to bury me.This decision displays a noble and unselfish concern for the welfare of others. This is my way of giving back. I believe that everyone wants their life to mean something this is my way.

This is my plea to anyone reading this, especially prisoners who are selfish, donate your body to science, it will help so many people.
