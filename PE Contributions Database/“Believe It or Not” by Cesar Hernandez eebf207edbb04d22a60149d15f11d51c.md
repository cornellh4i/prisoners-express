**“Believe It or Not” by Cesar Hernandez**

I got to see magician Steve Wyrick film him fourth of July special for A&E. I think it was called Death Drop of Fire. He filmed it in front of Planet Hollywood. His business partner Chester Bennington was the host. I got there early to get a good spot right up front.

About two hours prior, the Strip was completely shut down. No vehicle traffic was allow in front of Planet Hollywood. About one hour prior, they moved everybody back. We all had to stand about 30 feet away and had to look slightly upward toward the platform.

Steve was going to be put in a wooden box. The box is connected to a rope on a crane. There is a safety chain so the box doesn’t fall on the ground.

The cameras start rolling, Chester is explaining things which Steve gets in the box. The blanket is put on top, then set on fire. The crane starts to lift the the burning box. Chester says there are technical problems.The box is burning too fast. The box is lowered and the crew uses about ten fire extinguishers. There is a huge cloud. They had the blanket off and put a new one on. They sit it aflame and start to raise the box.

The rope starts to catch fire and Steve has still not escaped. Finally, the rope burns through and the box falls. The empty box is hanging in the air. A few seconds later, you hear a helicopter. It comes over Planet Hollywood and the spotlight points to the helicopter. It lands right on the strip and Steve Wyrick gets out. The helicopter immediately takes off again.

It took me about two hours to figure it out. The “technical difficulties” were really just a distraction. Steve and the crew were dressed alike. As soon as the box was lowered Steve got out. The box was extinguished and quickly reset. When the box was set aflame for the second time, it was already empty. Steve was already in route to the helicopter. The helicopter was ready to take off as soon as the burning box fell towards the ground. Steve Wyrick is a very good magician.
