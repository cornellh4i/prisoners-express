**Prisoner Lives Matter by Rodney “Shaheed” Derrickson**

In prisons all across the United States of America, prisoners are suffering abuse, mistreatment, and outright denial of humanity all because of our status as “prisoners”. Prisoners’ Lives Matter!

Prisoners are often oppressed, beaten, harassed, tear gassed, isolated, murdered, denied of our dignity, humanity and status as citizens all under the guise of security and control. Prisoner Lives Matter!

Prisoners are grandmothers, mothers, sisters, aunts, daughters, nieces, grandfathers, brothers, uncles, son, nephew, i.e. human beings. Prisoners’ Lives Matter!

Prisoners deserve to be equally treated with human decency, respect, compassion, and non-discriminatory actions by prison staff not only as moral right, but as a human right. Prisoners’ Lives Matter!

Prisoners should be places where people who committed offense against society to find opportunities for redemption, repentance, restoration, rehabilitation, treatment, transformation, education, and mercy with the needed hope to one day return prisoners back to society as reformed and productive citizens. Prisoners’ Lives Matter!
