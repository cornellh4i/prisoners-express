**“Helping Hand” by Biles Beleher**

To help out others in need one must really be willing to give another person or animal a Helping Hand.

There is so much to this. Taking care of injured animals or people. Here in prison, it’s both on me! Taking care of birds or cats, a chance to give another a fighting chance to live. Feeding, mending a wing or limb, giving medicine, or grooming an animal is therapeutic to me.

As for people it's helping out with a letter, grievance matters, and/or helping someone in a wheelchair. I’ve had to clean up a room, help a man get to, and in the shower. Had to take a man to get blood filtered, and cook meals. A lot goes on here, not anyone caring or doing anything to change attitudes or lives for that matter. A smile and thank you goes a long way back here. It's hell back here, but some heaven is found and treasured. I hope and pray it is better on the outside than in here as far as Helping Hands are concerned. When I was growing up that's what you did for others without asking, or taking anything in return.
