**Thankful By Amun Rasoul Merezzin**

Not long ago as a young skipper, as I look back down the corridor of it all, sunshine, laughter no cares in the world nahmean! Blink, turn around and I see the roof of the temple has frost and snow upon it, its lights grow dimmer, while its pillars more feeble now than then as the former understands the latter it succumbs to the reality that death has not won yet life has not ignored; the fight that has taken place since a long time ago, so in the face of death, shielded by time, grace and mercy not luck but prayers have been my (ally) and once myself has been my foe now faith has given me a new self one of thanks and not of regrets. Yet I call out those names of them who have, and some that still remain by my side mostly in spirit yet some others by mail or phone, we say thanks to each other, thankful for the parity the memories and new beginnings as the old has passed us by, whole today remains apart of our past its the future that guides us onward and with gratitude we cling hoping for more yet content with the now, we share better days to come, I write you now and dig you later, by joy and pain sunshine meets rain, I wash away the old I shine as of new learning better than I come, so I’m thankful in every sense of the world, as salaam alaykum all-our- the world…
