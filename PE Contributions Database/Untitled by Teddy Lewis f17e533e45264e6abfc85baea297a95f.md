**Untitled by Teddy Lewis**

O.K. So, today is my first week of release from state prison. It’s been so long that I have stopped counting the years, yet I saw this boardwalk and it seems like a nice place to sit. I needed a place to come and think about all the things I have been through; yet, I can’t take too much time to sit here ‘cause my life’s calling and I need answers.

There are 2 giant mountains in front of me, but as I look closer, I noticed that the mountains have suddenly moved and the path in the middle where I’m sitting is clear, which may be the answer I’m looking for.

Hmmm… Hmmm. Thank you, God. You did it again!
