**“As Remarkable As It May Seem…” by Todd Leatherland**

The card in my ID holder reads “Believe” in futuristic azure font. I believe that humans are remarkable in spite of the challenge of the human condition. Unbelievable events, both uncanny and supernatural, are apart of our life experience.

When I was three days old, I got pneumonia and almost died; my mother would often tell me that. She also said I would play for hours in my crib by myself, content in my own little world. Being an introvert, this makes sense. Perhaps it’s time to make peace with my inward slanting nature.

Believe it or not, I started drinking with my mother at age eleven. We were drinking buddies, partying with my friends on the weekend. The Rocky Horror Picture Show was a family tradition; we were still attending public showings in the theatre until the year she died.

Audience participation.

I dreamt about her death a week before it happened; and, even though she believed in Christ, a friend, who was a medium, helped me cleanse the apartment afterwards because of two spirits present, lingering - one was a guardian, an old lady with silver hair, and the other was an angry little girl: my mother had been clinically diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.

Although, my mother feared dying alone, in the end, she didn’t. I was there. The last thing I heard from her was innocent child-like laughter. The night before I moved out, my mother appeared to me in a dream. She was glittery, translucent gold in form, tickling me just like when I was a boy.

Believe it or not, I often dream of things before they happen. I dreamt of both my grandmother’s deaths too.

My father died the day I got out of prison, which sounds like a country song by David Allen Cole, but it’s true. He held on long enough to hear my voice I told him I loved him and was coming home. He passed on during my journey to the house. When I got there, I read chapter seventeen of the Gospel of John, Yahshua’s prayers for his taut ones; then, I carried out my father’s body.

Afterwards, his restless spirit roamed the property. He would knock hats off the hat rack, scatter loose change off the nightstand and trap our animal in strange places. My step-mother consulted a medium. The medium said my father was discontented because he had died so young, at age 55. All of the photographs of his final days were filled with a blurry of activities - living life to the fullest like shooting his .44 magnum and baking cookies in an apron.

Astonishingly, a catholic priest gave my father his last rites with holy water brought all the way from Lourdes, France, the location of many reported miracles over the centuries. My step-mother swears the holy water was applied liberally to my father. When my bottle was given to me, it was filled to the brim; another drop could not be added.

Believe it or not, supernatural events have always occurred in my life.

In elementary school, during television special by acclaimed Israeli psychic, Uri Geller, I was able to restart an old broken watch with extra-sensory perception. It continued to tick for many days.

I’ve seen an interdimensional being.

I’ve been involved in more than one exorcism

Spiritual warfare is a continuous reality

I’ve seen demons on multiple occasions

I’ve seen angels (twice) and they are humongous

I’ve lived in an apartment that was haunted by a nurse named Nan; that fact was confirmed by a medium. Nan liked me but bothered my girlfriend and gave her nightmares. Eventually, she broke up with me, if you can believe that.

I’ve lived in other haunted places too.

For years I believed in extraterrestrials, but now I am not so sure...even though I do have a tattoo of one.

Believe it or not, I once found a tree that looks like the crucified Christ. It still amazes me.

Some things are inexplicable.

Believe it or not, drugs destroyed my life in the past and the lives of those around me.

Back in the day, I smuggled drugs across the Mexican border at Matamoros over fifty times and was never caught. Ultimately, however, it did catch up to me. During poignant moments of honestly, regret from all of the damage I caused surfaces. The negative consequences still revenerate.

It is possible that I found my soulmate long ago. We remain friends, even though we don’t talk anymore; life has moved on: drugs were our downfall.

Believe it or not, I used drugs for over twenty-five years, but now have almost five years clean. This is a miracle. Sometimes I still have mild cravings for a cigarette.

My first felony conviction was for psilocybin mushrooms, a fungus that grows naturally all across the world, and could be argued, was key to man’s evolutionary development- if you believe in such things. After being convicted by a judge who is now an active U.S. Congressman, I was sentenced to six years in prison.

There, working as an outside trustee around hundreds of head of cattle on thousands of acres of ranchlands, I tripped on more psilocybin than in the world. On one tip, I experienced the destruction of the planet which, admittedly, sounds a bit kooky, until you consider that was fifteen years ago, and our current state of climate catastrophe has proven that premonition accurate.

Believe it or not, the weather is being controlled; partly to remediate climate change; partly because the atmosphere has been weaponized; partly because there is profit in food futures and disaster capitalism.

Weather warfare

Believe it or not, the truth is scary

I’ve been close to death. I tell from forty foot and lived. It shattered my pelvis. My right leg is now one inch shorter than the other. Miraculously, after surgery, I stood on my own in one week. Week two: I walked to the bathroom and back.

Yahshua’s Grace.

Today, despite the physical setbacks, I can still play the game I love basketball. And not just play but be a factor, Freakin brothers every way like MJ, with my moves from 1986.

And as remarkable as it may sound, I have been using the same #2 pencil for a year now, which has been instrumental in the majority of my Prisoner Express writings so far. This pencil, Dixon HB 1404, is an absolute savage. Turn up graphite grinder. What, what!

Believe it or not.
