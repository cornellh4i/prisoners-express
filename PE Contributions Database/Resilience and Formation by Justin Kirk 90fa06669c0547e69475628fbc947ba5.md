**Resilience and Formation by Justin Kirk**

Resilience. What an appropriate word for a prisoner. Confined. Locked away from the world yet still fighting to find meaning in his own limited way. To move past his shame and guilt and see something within himself that is good. To awaken each day in a box and put on a smile for the crowd.

I wouldn’t have chosen that word to describe myself, but I find it very appropriate.

Being a prisoner is a monotonous thing. Day in day out, our lives are a formation of events. Like soldiers marching we all know our place, we know our next step by the clock on the wall.

5:30am Count

12:30pm Count

4:30pm Count

9:00pm Count

Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Sleep.

Formations.

But somewhere in between those times we find the resilience to carry us through the worst moments. The hardest days. The days we just want to give up or lash out at someone around us and fight and destroy and burn down our own lives because that's all we’ve ever known. Those days are bad.

For me the resilience comes from those who have given me a reason to fight. For a higher purpose, to be a better person. People I love, people who have changed me, even the words written by fellow prisoners. Like Victor Frankl in “a man’s search for meaning.” We must find meaning in our life. We must be resilient. We must be more than prisoners.
