Fitting In=(Ego + Americans) / Materialism

If looked at objectively, I think "Fitting In" all boils down to the ego. Were it not for ego, our penchant to fit in would no doubt cease to exist. But as the ego is a pronounced part of the human psyche, each of us ought to take steps to reduce its influence in our daily lives. Ultimately, one should strive toward the goal of total self-realization. Unfortunately, most people have neither the time nor the inclination to do so. I was told recently that simply recognizing the ego within oneself is a major step in overcoming its negative effects.

The concept of Fitting In, the desire to be accepted by this or that group, to wear the right clothes, speak the right way, drive the right car, etc. is not exclusively an American idiosyncrasy, but it is more prevalent in this country than others. Our culture (if this confluence of nationalities can be said to have a culture) seems to promote the idea of Fitting In with its materialistic obsessions.

"Keeping up with the Jones'" used to be a facetious way of describing people attempting to accumulate the same (or better) material possessions as their neighbors. They wanted to belong, to be accepted, to fit in. In today's world that same saying appears to have become a way of life, a goal that supercedes the more important aspects of home and family. It's almost as if it has supplanted the family itself.

Americans spend more time working more hours to obtain more possessions than, from what I can gather, the people of any other country. Healthy and constructive activities like family outings, family discussions, and general "quality time", have been replaced by this need to have more "things". This process has eroded many of the family values, morals, and ethics that once made this a proud and desirable country to live in. I want to believe that American could once again reach that same level of prestige and honor, but first we Americans will have to undergo a major change in the way we view what's important for our future and not concentrate almost solely on immediate gratification of self.

I realize that I'm getting off of the subject a little. I have a tendency to ramble so much that soon I've lost the intended subject of discussion. Does that mean I wouldn't fit in amongst this or that group? Should I care? Maybe, but then again that would be my ego. The very fact that I even think what I have to say in this article is of any value to those reading it is so incredibly egotistic it isn't even funny! And yet, I still laugh at it.
