**My Body: Transformation by Myron Martens**

After about a decade of putting my body through extreme, inadvertent neglect, disregarding my health, letting it deteriorate, I finally feel as though I have begun to embark on a solid path of recovery and healing through physical and spiritual exercise. My body is now undergoing a drastic change, improving for the better good. I believe, since I made the conscious decision to take my health and fitness seriously a few years ago in county jail.

When I was in the county, I had heard all sorts of war stories about prison life since I was facing “the other death penalty” - life without parole. I had resolved to train up to get physically fit in preparation for an inevitably long prison sentence. For I surely did not want to become another statistic in another war story in another county jail. Little did I know, I was about to embrace a total body transformation: mind, body, spirit.

So I started working out: push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, squats, dips; callisthenics, also known as bodyweight exercises. Before long, I was doing 1000 pushups a day and squats in sets of 75. I made fitness goals and actually achieved them. But soon after I settled into life at central prison, I fell off. I quit working out for several months and lost a fight. Shortly thereafter, I was placed in I-CON (SEG) for 6 months.

After I was put in I-CON - intensive control - I developed a new passion and desire to come back out of SEG new and improved, in better shape. I started reading magazines like Men’s Health, Muscle and Fitness, taking note of some of the workouts and programs featured about diet and exercise. I learned a lot of new workouts to do in a cell with no additional weight or equipment utilizing just my bodyweight.

In my determination to get in shape and my pursuit of physical fitness goals, I started studying health and fitness like a science. I’ve gained a variety of knowledge of training disciplines like: Tabata, Hiit, Tae-Bo, Crossfit, Pilates, and Yoga.

Learning about these different styles and forms of fitness has helped guide me onto a path of physical, mental, and spiritual recovery. It comes with a certain level of comradeship with some of the other guys also into fitness. It allows me to bounce off ideas and gain a better understanding of various workouts, improving my own personal growth and development.

Yoga led me more into the spiritual development and mindfulness aspect of life, as I dived into: meditation, prayer, Asanas (stretches), Pranayama (vital breath), relaxation. Yes, I am actually trying to learn how to relax. I’ve learned Yoga is not only good for warm-ups before a workout and cool downs after, but it also introduced me to a whole new philosophy and practice of mindfulness. There is so much to the world of Yoga.

This, as I’ve said, helped me get into spiritual development to supplement my gains in the physical. Now as I continue to practice physical and spiritual regeneracy, I feel my mind is calmed a bit, I’m building strength and endurance and getting in better shape. I am making small gains towards a healthier, happier me.

“Fall in love with the process and the results will come,” said one of the IIBB pros. But it is only through constant, continual practice of mindfulness (my spiritual exercises) and workouts like Tabata and Hiit (my physical exercises) that I grow or get anything out of it. I have lost nearly 40 lbs since I began this journey and I’ve chiseled and toned down to next to no fat on my body. Plus, I’ve gained some muscle mass and I can just about run a 10K comfortably. It has taken commitment, dedication, discipline, and hard work to change my body and improve my overall health: mentally, emotionally, physically.

Therefore, my body-mind, body-spirit, is now being transformed into a new creation, thanks in part to my physical and spiritual exercise. Almost like when a caterpillar builds its cocoon and it becomes transformed into a butterfly. I am building my cocoon (so-to-speak) as I daily practice physical and spiritual exercise, so that in the end result I would become transformed by the renewing of my mind into a healthier, better me. It’s about healthy living for me now. I feel better and I rarely get sick, so I must be doing something right.
