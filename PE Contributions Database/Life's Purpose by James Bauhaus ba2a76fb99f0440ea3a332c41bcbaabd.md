**Life’s Purpose By James Bauhaus**

Life has no purpose, being an assemblage of entropy - defying molecules that, most often, has no ability to conceive any thoughts. Life does seem to have a goal, however: to reproduce the genes that it derived from. Life also seems to possess a secondary goal of experimenting with complexity, in addition to the more basic goals of feeding, growing, surviving and reproducing,

Complex life is much less successful than unicellular life in terms of numbers and total mass, but it does have the advantage of higher and higher mental functions. It would seem that a tertiary goal of life may be the evolution of intelligence. Of course, this is only a tiny splinter of one experiment that life is performing in the vastness of evolution. So far, there is no indication that smarter is more fit for survival. Anecdotal proof of this is occurring right now, 8-16-17. For the past 3 days, the news-sellers have been trying to make our Buffoon-in-Charge, Donald Trump, denounce the Nazis, who bought a permit from Charlottesville town council to march around in circles near a confederate statue. Instead, Trump denounced both permit holders and the group of rock-throwers who swarmed in to take away the Nazi’s right to pay for their right to assemble and to “free” speech.

Life may be fooling us all by not trying to evolve intelligence, but really only trying to create comedy. It is fairly comical to hear and see a news-seller actually say, seriously, without laughing, “You can tell that the Nazi’s meant to act violently because they brought sheilds and helmets as weapons!” In fact, these Nazi’s finally seemed to learn to prepare after being pelted, pummeled and chased around with sticks during their last parade in, I think, Freemont, California a year or two ago, which I wrote about under some title on [www.jamesbauhaus.org](http://www.jamesbauhaus.org/). Yes it could well be that life only evolved a little bit of intelligence in order to appreciate the slapstick of politics that looks so much like a Three Stooges convention.
