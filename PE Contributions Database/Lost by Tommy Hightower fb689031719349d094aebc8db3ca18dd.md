**by Tommy Hightower**

We have all been lost in one form or another, at some time in our lives. It’s a good bet that other prisoners can relate to this: when I first entered these cold, concrete walls, how very lost was I. Like a naked newborn, was I, every eye must be able to see how scared I was on the inside. With my outer self, chest out, head up, did I exude confidence? Not real, but surreal.

Where did I go? Who will be my cellmate? Are those guards really that cold-hearted? Man, these guys look like they want to kill me--why? What a facade every newly incarcerated must display. Like a peacock with tail feather spread, or the puffer fish, making up physical displays.

All lies to hide that scared child inside. Truly insecure yet unwilling to admit.

“I sure could use a friend at this time.” We are all lost sometimes.
