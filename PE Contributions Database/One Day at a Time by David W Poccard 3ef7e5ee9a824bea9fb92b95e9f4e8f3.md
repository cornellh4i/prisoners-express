**One Day at a Time by David W. Poccard**

Granger stepped to the mouth of the cave and looked out, wondering if it was clear. The trees were bare and he knew the snow would be falling soon and he didn’t have the supplies he’d need to make it through winter. He barely had what he needed for the week he’d been hiding out in the cave. It was time to move on and hope he wasn’t spotted.

He’d had a lot of time to think while in the cave, wondering if he should have done things differently, playing through his mind a dozen alternate universes where he did the right thing, the smart thing, or even nothing. Instead he’d chosen to do the wrong thing. Granger always seemed to do the wrong thing, the story of his life.

“If it weren’t for bad luck,” his Uncle Louie had once said to him, “you wouldn’t have any luck at all.”

Granger didn’t believe in luck or karma or destiny. He didn’t believe in God or Buddha or Cthulhu. He thought he believed in love once but that had gotten him into the most trouble of all. Now all he believed in was getting through life one day at a time.

The town was only a five mile hike, though it took him four hours to get there as he made use of concealment and stealth so as not to be discovered. He stopped behind some rocks amid trees on a hill overlooking the town. It was one of his favorite spots as a kid where he pretended he was a Sioux warrior scoping out the town for his impending attack. He had the same feeling now.

The town of Birch, Minnesota had only one main road running through it with no stop lights or stop sign. Follow the road north and you reached Canada in an hour, head south for five hours and you can make it to the Twin Cities. On one side of the highway was a ravine carved out by Loon River that eventually connected with the Mississippi. On the other side of the road was the town Granger was born and raised in.

Birch consisted of a general store/ gas station, a bar, post office and a couple dozen homes on the hill behind the town. It was one of those homes that Granger now made his way towards. It was the same home he had run from the week prior as his wife lay crying and dying.

As Granger moved through the trees closer to the homes he was acutely aware of the stillness. Birch was an empty, desolate shell. The bodies had been taken away and burned and those who hadn’t died and been taken to the military camps to be watered, tested upon, guarded. Granger himself had almost been taken because he’d stayed too long at his wife’s side and when the military grunts in hazmat suits arrived he had to hurt one to get away. He led the search team south down the Loon River Ravine before backtracking and making his way to the cave.

They said the virus had been designed in North Korea and it was effectively killing two thirds of the planet’s population. Some were immune, such as Granger, and the military had a particular interest in them. Granger wasn’t about to become a lab rat and instead became a lone wolf running for his life and hiding in caves.

In his home he stared at the bed where the love of his life had been destroyed by the virus that had no cure. He steeled himself from any feelings, letting only the rage fuel him as he gathered the supplies he needed. He hoped he didn’t have to battle or hide from his own country’s military - shouldn’t they instead be going after those in North Korea responsible for this viral devastation? That was Granger’s plan and he’d do it one day at a time.
