**“Maybe” by Kevin Murphy**

I look upon the glass, the finish of a lake. Mountain’s feet meeting in the distance, their bodies making a valley that ends here. I sit on the end of a wooden pier, the only blemish in an otherwise untouched place. The water reflects the surroundings in such a way that it’s hard to tell where the two meet. The air is still and full of the smells of earth, of greens and browns, of life. Everything is so still it feels as if time has stopped, that it holds no power here.

At the end of my life how is it that I feel the life in everything around me? Is it just this timeless place that I’m visiting or is it that I feel so much because so much of me is already seeped back into the world that I was created from?

Time that had always seemed to pass so slowly now feels as if it has passed by too fast. I long for my childhood even more that I longed for my adulthood when I was a child. There’s no price I wouldn’t pay to be able to go back to the time when I was young and free. But there’s no more going back. There’s no do overs. Life is what it is, a beginning, a middle, and an end. It may be that it lasts for mere seconds or it could last for a century or more. It all depends on the way the stars are aligned, how much luck you have, and how strong your life’s energy is. My life has lasted for half a century and won’t see another decade. Luck and stars have not been my companions and the energy that I was so full of in my youth fails me now and my end is near enough that I can feel its approach.

Sitting here on this pier,the world seems at peace and I try to take my fill of it. I close my eyes, extend my arms, lay my head back and take a deep breath. I try my best to draw in the peace and life from it but my mind is unable to grasp hold of the peace and my body holds only what was there before. I lower my arms, my head, and I let out my breath, the end of which is a sigh filled with grief and regret.

I open my eyes and set the picture on the tiny table in my cell. The world becoming hard and small once again, the air stale and empty. The weight of prison settles down in a familiar way and I adjust its load so that it doesn’t crush me.

The lake sits unblemished, the mountains unmoved, the air still.

I look at the picture with a longing that will never be fulfilled. The person sitting on the pier isn’t me, and yet in some way I feel that it is, that it was, that it may one day be. Maybe it will be the beginning at my end? Maybe I was there before? Maybe it will be the beginning at my end? Maybe I was there before? Maybe I’m there now and this place is only imagined? Or maybe it’s nothing more than a picture of someone sitting on a pier that’s extended out onto a lake that’s surface is like glass, where mountains meet and a valley ends. A place where the air is still and full of life and peace.
