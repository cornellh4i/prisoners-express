****One cannot help but be fascinated with a view of any big city from the air. Any given ity takes on a new level of enchantment from any height above the tops of its tallest buildings, and even from vantage points on those buildings. Who hasn’t marveled at the bravado of city window washing crews as they ply the faces of those edifices? What freedom that activity seems to elicit, in the sense that one is although restrained, free in the wilds of inner space. Heights fascinate most humans, and I’m no exception: my tenure on a military parachute demonstration team clearly served to increase my fascination with the striking sights of a city skyline from the air. While enjoying the parachute descent through a metropolitan area, the music of the Scorpions’ “Big City Nights,” Foghat’s “Fool for the City,” Joni Mitchell or Nazareth’s “This Flight Tonight,” and Robin Trower and Jame Dewar’s “For Earth Below” played repeatedly in my mind.

When flying in a commercial aircraft with my folks as a child, I looked out the airplane’s window and dreamt of what it would be like to go from the relative safety of my seat to some interesting point on the ground below. Later in life, my assignment to the Army parachute team was the realization of that dream. From a curious 4 year old on a flight between New York City and Florida to see relatives to a seaborne journey with a U.S. military assignment to what was then West Germany, I was spellbound at the prospect of flying there in a Lockheed “Super Constellation,” one of the fastest and sleekest airliners of its time with its triple-finned tail section and 4 supercharged engines that swing huge 4-blade propellers.

Having graduated from jump school to feed my incessant addiction to a need to exit aircraft in flight, the tryout program for the Army parachute team seemed the logical next move. My first year on the team. I was sent on a vivid path of Deja vu: on our schedule was a weekend of demonstration jumps into the amusement park at Coney Island New York where I vacationed with my family as a child. On the occasion of the demo at Coney Island, the terminal of LaGuardia Airport in New York City, our demo site, was pretty much as I remembered it.

Our team aircraft, a Viet Nam era DeHavilland C-7 Caribou, actually a YC-7A model, kept to just under 2000 feet to remain in the unrestricted airspace below that of the terminal control area of New York. As we approached the demo site, our illustrious team leader affectionately nicknamed “Weasel” was furiously snapping pictures through the open door of the airplane. With the entire upper half of his body extended through the open door, he framed closeup shots of the city without any hint of the aircraft in the picture. Then, with a horrified look on his face, he came back into the aircraft with the body of the camera--and no lens!

At the end of the weekend event, our team aircraft climbed out from the departure end of LaGuardia, I reflected on the memories of this place that helped to shape my love of airplanes and the adventure they provided. Having the experience of the parachute ride towers in two disparate places will always be an unforgettable pleasure.
