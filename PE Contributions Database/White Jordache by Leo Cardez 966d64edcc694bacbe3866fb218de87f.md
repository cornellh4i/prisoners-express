**White Jordache by Leo Cardez**

Ricky was my childhood bully. We were the same age, same class, living on the same block. I was an undersized, bucktooth, big-eared nerd who had to fight the current in the shower. He was held back a year and had unnatural muscle definition for a 10 year old. He tortured me for years. I was weak, scared, and an all-around perfect target.

My parents were Mexican immigrants who grew up third-world poor. For us, a trip to Burger King was considered a nice dinner out and relegated to birthdays and holidays – and even then only if we had a coupon - 2-for-1 Whoppers! I was forced to wear my older sister's hand-me-downs. She was twice my size and although a bit of a tomboy she still wore girl’s clothes.

There was one exception: these white Jordache jeans. I loved them and although they were clearly too big for me I insisted on wearing them; even if I had to bunch up the waist with a belt. I thought I was so cool - Crocks from Miami Vice. But Ricky would soon try to change all of that.

He must have been some sort of fashion prodigy because he knew they were girl’s jeans and made sure to point it out to the class. It hit me hard. I thought I finally looked cool. I could feel my huge ears burning bright red and in a moment of rage said something about Ricky's mom. Back then, that was the worst insult you could make; "mama” jokes were big. And then it was set: we would be fighting after school.

It was the longest day of my life. I watched the clock with dread as it mercilessly ticked down. I was scared. I didn't know how to fight. Stupid jeans! I thought.

I kept to the same routine as I walked home with my friends Van and Vernon. They were the only black kids in my grade and twins, and as such, were outcasts like me. A block from my house I could see a small crowd of kids had gathered; Ricky was pacing, smiling at me - I could read his thoughts. Mine would be the easiest ass he ever kicked.

Survival instincts kicked in and I ran like hell. Van and Vernon tried to hold Ricky back (God bless’em!) but him and his crew broke through and gave Chase. I ran with the speed of a gazelle in the savanna and busted through my kitchen door out of breath and terrified.

My sister took one look at me and calmly got up from her chair, crossed the kitchen, grabbed a large butcher knife and walked out the door. I could hear her screaming, daring them, threatening to chop their baby nuts off. I was still in shock, still laying on the floor heaving when she walked back in, put the knife away, and went back to her homework. She never said a word. Neither did I, but at that moment I realized my sister was a badass.

I don't remember if I ever wear those jeans again, I think I did. Ricky was still a bully, that wouldn't change for a few years, when girls became the new priority. But he never chased me home again. I would eventually grow into my ears and braces fixed my teeth, but inside I still felt like that scared gazelle. But in one way or another my sister would always be there to save me and that started to give me a new sense of confidence.

My sister and I would grow close and then grow apart over the next couple of decades. Our relationship was episodic like that. But I always held on to the belief that besides our parents, she was my greatest protector. The fierce mama bear ready to protect her cubs against all enemies – and she has.

Dedicated to my sister Antonia... For everything. Thank you for being my sister.
