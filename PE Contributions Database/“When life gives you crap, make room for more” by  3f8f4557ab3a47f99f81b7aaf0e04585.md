**“When life gives you crap, make room for more” by Steven P. Arthur**

It would be real easy for me to fall into depression, offer excuses and just plain give up on life. Prison sucks. Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever thought I would end up in a maximum-security prison serving a life sentence. But alas, here I am and that is exactly what I’m doing. But you won’t hear me cry about it… often. No. I prefer to take what life has thrown my way, mostly because of my own choices, and make the best of it. Honestly, if it weren’t for prison I seriously doubt I would’ve ever discovered how much I love to read or how much I have to say or share in the form of writing. More often than not, I sit down in front of this antiquated machine a “Neo,” which according to “The American Century” dictionary means “new or modern” (I can assure you that it is anything but) and just start writing. With no idea, direction, or prompting, I just let the words come to me.

Sometimes I find many pearls of wisdom, good story ideas, or just plain junk in my writing. But it’s mine!!! My thoughts, my dreams, ideas, and creations. I can build worlds with my words, or with people and places little known or never having existed. So, I encourage all of my fellow writers, wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, however bad you may or may not have it, make the best of it. Love your life, embrace the suck no matter what it is because it is the only one you have.
