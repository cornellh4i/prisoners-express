**“Picture Theme” by Nate A. Lindell** 	

This is a strange pic. I wonder If some psychology major chose it so they could study our responses, because our responses will say a lot about subconscious axes we’re grinding.

Many will fail to notice that the kids aren’t shackled but are holding the chains (As many hold onto beliefs that drag down their growth/prosperity); they won’t realize, from the unnatural/irrational setting that the kids are models, assuming that the kids are post-slavery collateral damage of racism. There will be at least three essays on slavery … none offering constructive solutions … holding those chains.

Rather than racism and slavery, I ask you to consider that in general the chains we’re taught to hold and the blinders we’re trained to wear since we’re born.

I could’ve written a story about this, and maybe I will (Sometimes a lesson is best taught indirectly through a story which allows surlier pupils to come to their own conclusions.) But being busy, y’all being adults, consider these examples of chains and blinders we’re taught to do as children: Santa Claus-generally, a pleasant lie, a lie that teaches us to play along with lies because everyone else is doing so.

“It’s jut the way It is.” The excuse for endless social injustices, including prisons and post-slavery trauma-but that’s not “just the way it is”. It’s just the way we’ve let it be because we let it be so. (Groups like France’s yellow vests have gotten off their asses to make it be some other way, as their ancestors did on the first Bastille Day). Of course there are religious, gender, and many other chains and binders we’re taught to handicap ourselves with, which have become so normal that we fail to realize that they are chains and binders.

Franz Kafka’s bizarre story “Metamorphosis” is most commonly interpreted as sending the message the creator of this picture intends to send: we trap ourselves In unnatural, handicapped roles in modern society. (Y’all should read Kafka’s other story, “In the Penal Colony”!)

Ironically, one chain that I held-that it’s unmasculine for a man to master poetry or literature-held me back from learning about Kafka until I was in my 30s! What makes that chain doubly ironic is that, as I learned from studying the origins of English poetry and great writers like Cervantes, Edmond Rostand and Alexander Dumas. Those who built the foundations for our great Western literature were not effeminate, not weak. In fact, as exemplified In the classic, “Cyrano De Bergerac”, many warriors were also poets, from the notorious Celts all into Medieval Europe and, exemplified by Ernest Hemingway, modern America.

Yet somehow-particularly In rural white America, even in the largely Celtic Blue Ridge/Appalachian areas, despite the ancient Celts prizing of their poets-the false idea that being a wordsmith Is a sign of weakness has taken root. Now, with texting and tweeting further crucifying our language, with technology so blinding/distracting us, I doubt many will care to sharpen their verbal swords … which Is fine by me, ‘cause I’m gonna impress all the girls while the tongue tied many hold their chains.
