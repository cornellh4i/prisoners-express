**“My Body” by** **R. Cody Belk**

My body is not what I would like it to be. I can’t model or compete on a Ninja Warrior show. I’ll never be renowned for being a “certain age” and looking a “certain socially desirable way”. No, my body is a blemish riddled amalgamation of the residual effects of physical torment. (I wonder what the hell my psyche looks like, ha.) It is a veritable showcase of scar tissue, surgically implanted steel and irregularly grown bone. The visible effects of both unsuccessful suicide attempts and genetic defect pepper its surface and the tangible substantiation of unnatural spinal curvature methodically pierces the posterior of my gray matter. Ever present are the synaptic reminders of falls and blunt force traumas, of blades separating flesh or an undeserved fist to the mouth jostling teeth from their proper place of residence. Pectoral muscles will always be asymmetrical because of a freak accident that tore off an arm. Yes, *an arm*. It was reattached but at what costs? Is it better to have something if it is a source of unbelievably sharp pain at all times? Deformed and hurting? Hideous and clumsy?

Broken bones, nose out of blace, left heel crushed, shattered. Knee gone bad trying to balance what the heel no longer can.My body is *F.U.C.K.E.D,* but it’s a testament to my strength. And if it is even fractionally represented by the quantity and, dare I say “quality” of my disfigurements, then someone please give me a trophy to show off on display. No, wait, I already have one.
