The Colorful and Convoluted Story of My Grandparents by Chad Frank

My parents were only 15 when I was born. After my dad died in a train surfing accident when I was two, my mom was forced to raise me as a single parent. Because of this, I don’t know much about my dad’s family. Here is what little I know about them:

My mom tells me that my dad didn’t want me to ever be around his parents. I can understand why. THey’re not very stable people.

My dad’s last name shouldn’t have been “Frank.” Apparently, my grandmother didn’t bother to change her name when she got divorced from her first husband. So when she gave birth to my dad and the father wasn’t there to sign the birth certificate, the hospital automatically assumed my dad’s father was this guy, Frank.

All I know about this Frank guy is that when my grandmother was pregnant with my dad, he flew into a jealous rage, tied my pregnant grandmother up, and torched the house. My grandmother, and father, would have died had my Aunt Monique not come home and found the house ablaze and called for help.

I have no way of verifying this story because Frank disappeared before I was born and I no longer talk to any of my dad’s family. But I have no trouble believing it to be true, considering the dysfunctional way she lived when I did talk to them. My Aunt Monique was a drug addict and a drunk who let her kids run around naked (not that I complained). My grandmother was a drunk and a compulsive gambler; most of my memories of her revolve around tagging along to her AA meetings and bingo halls. When I could track her down, she was constantly moving from place to place to avoid bill collectors. These factors made it hard to get to know her. They also led to our eventual estrangement.

Because my mom was under 21 when she had me, she couldn’t legally serve as my guardian; therefore, she couldn’t serve as the executor of a wrongful death lawsuit that was filed against the transportation authority by my grandmother on my behalf. Since it was for an undisclosed amount, I had no way of knowing how much I was set to inherit, but rumor had it that it was in the six-figure range. In the end, though, it didn’t matter. My grandmother stalled me out as long as possible. By the time I got the money shortly after my 21st birthday, all that was left after court fees and taxes was a few thousand dollars. Though no dollar amount could erase the pain of having grown up without a father, I can think of a lot better ways to have spent it than on drinks and bingo chips. (Ironically, that’s pretty much how I spent my portion of it.) I still hold a grudge against Grandma Frank for pretending she was looking out for my best interests, only to screw me out of my inheritance. But I guess she’s paying her personal hell for doing so: I hear she’s in poor health, most likely the result of all those years of chain smoking and drinking at my expense.

My mom’s family isn’t much more stable.

My great-grandparents were the Hodinskys, both of whom were the first generation American children of Polish and Ukrainian immigrants who came to the Philly area to work in the factories during the Depression. Grandpa Hodinsky drank himself to death before I was born, but I’ve heard stories about how he had done prison time for bootlegging and armed bank robbery. By the time I met Grandma Hodinsky, who we grandkids called “Nanny,” she was a feeble old lady who depended on others to get around, chain-smoked Lucky Strikes, and loved watching “The Price is Right.” In her old black-and-white pictures, Grandma Hodinsky was quite a catch in her day, a real-life Betty Boop. With her hourglass figure, big breasts, big brown eyes and short curly brown hair, and a cigarette constantly dangling from her lips, she must’ve been quite a sex symbol back then… or at least Grandpa Hodinsky thought so. He married her as soon as legally possible and started a family immediately. They ended up having four children, all girls. My grandmother, Regina, was their middle child.

When she was 16, Regina got pregnant by an older boy named Bobby McKeown. They got married shortly before my mom, Joanie, was born. Considering Grandpa Hodinsky’s past, I’m willing to bet it was a “shotgun wedding” indeed. Two years later, my Aunt Jackie was born.

According to family legend, Grandpa McKeown went out for milk one night and never found his way home. Truth is, my grandmother divorced him because he was such an abusive asshole who beat her constantly. My mom and Aunt Jackie were scarred by the abuse he doled upon them. He also carried on an affair with a girl not much older than my mom. Because of this, he and my mom didn’t speak much. My relationship with him was strained by emotional and physical abuse and empty promises to the point that I decided to stop talking to him as soon as I was able to make my own choices.

My grandmother went on to marry a guy named Petey, who was even more abusive than my grandfather. In addition to beating my grandmother, Petey also had a tendency to point guns at people’s heads and to shoot up the house whenever he got drunk, which was pretty much every night. Thankfully, Petey was gone before I could form any lasting memories of him.

My mom seems to have inherited my grandmother’s poor taste in men. Shortly after my dad died, she hooked up with a guy named Bobby Kercko. She fell in love with him because he was tall, dark, and handsome, had his own car and a steady job, which was more than most guys his age could say. He was also good with me and treated her well. My mom married Bobby when I was three. Not long afterward, Bobby started beating my mom, often right in front of me-- sometimes so severely that she had to go to the emergency room. I felt so helpless because I couldn’t stop him. I still have nightmares about those beatings. They’re still married and Bobby still drinks and does drugs, and occasionally lashes out at my mom. I don't understand why they’re still together. But I guess they’re just following the example that their own parents set.

Like my mom, Bobby came from an abusive home. His dad was a Korean war vet; his mom was a hula dancer who his dad had met while stationed in Pearl Harbor. Bobby’s dad would get drunk and beat his mom, Bobby, and his siblings.

With so much dysfunction running so deeply on both sides of my family, no wonder I turned out the way I did. Oh well, at least it gives me plenty to write about!
