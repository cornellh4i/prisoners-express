**Abandoned Church by Edward Wrench**

I’m writing about an

Abandoned church I

Saw in Chester county

It was a small white

Church the windows

Were blocked by some

Kind of stained glass

The roof was sunk in

To the point of a

Collapse or fall-in small

Doors-n-windows if I

Could have got a door

Inside I’m too big to fit

Through the front door

It had a lock on

The door it had

A cross above the

Door or was it a bell

I can’t remember
