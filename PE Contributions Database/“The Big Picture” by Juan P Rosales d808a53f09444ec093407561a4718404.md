**“The Big Picture” by Juan P. Rosales**

Oh, the blink of an eye. ‘Tis forgotten through day and night. Seldom thought of and when remembered, quickly dismissed as insignificant. But, it is so much more. So much more because it captures the big picture, moment by moment.

A friend in high school once said to me that life goes by in flashes. Blinks. That for every blink of an eye, a memory has been captured and stored. “Like pictures”, I had asked. She turned to me with a knowing smile and a secret within her eyes. Her words struck truth. It is now that I begin to analyze them as an archaeologist delicately peeling letter by letter to discover the treasure of wisdom underneath.

From her perspective, I see, laying back to open the photo album of captured moments, a most peaceful, lightening mood blankets those reveries. I do  laugh at times when I picture I’m in my own private theater, the stills of my life reeling on film and that same lightening mood projecting them on the big screen. Ha! It is such a joy to view moments like that, whatever the “motion picture” genre. This is my greatest scape when the open eye view is not so great.

So it goes to say, a blink of an eye is far from just a blink. Memories are being captured by our very own personal cameras with snap one of our shutters. Those still life moments are accessible at any time. Truly, life’s a big kodak moment. Get the big picture?
