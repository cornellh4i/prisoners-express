"Girl On Bench" by William Miles

Maybe, she thought to herself, *too much study makes one less sturdy*. So, she decided to sit and watch people travel from destination to destination as she sat on the little campus bench. She also observed the birds neath the trees, the copse a few paces away, the sunlight dappled green, it seemed so serene, at least to her eyes, birds flitting about pecking searching. No doubt for bits of bread on even seed, perhaps even nest material.

That Goth girl nesth her tree, all in black upon black silk, others of her ilk, bizarre people she laughed to herself as silently she coined a cute word “Creeple,” even her family are weird here dad probably 40+ years an artist, writer has the weirdest graphic novel, “Vashti.” Tho she is a vampire her story is more about unlike other about vampires or even their preternatural abilities.

Then there is Lania Hartier, whose mother is C.E.O. of a multi-billion dollar international corporation which supplies advanced weaponry of any sort to any who can afford, it is even rumored her mother even employs criminals, no records of such, but on billion at her disposal. But Lani is very down to earth and to generous, but not in a flaunting way, Lani works.

Zolee Lilly Oramuno, is a brilliant astrophysicist, genius insight on anything to do with astronomy, quiet and withdrawn, but very loyal to friends Zolee will talk your ear off and make you laugh till it hurts if you speak to her first, funny how she always know what you find hilarious.

And of course, myself, studying sociology, I do love people, a total extrovert and love a crowd the most. Not wealthy but I did receive a scholarship and I do well in class, myself I like to think of college as one big family.
