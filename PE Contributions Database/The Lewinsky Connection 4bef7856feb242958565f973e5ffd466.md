***The Lewinsky Connection* by John Naylor**

We vacationed quite a bit as a family. One year, we were looking for a decent barber in Abilene, Texas, an old cattle town, because my brother would soon be attending Abilene Christian University. We went to an older white guy’s shop downtown, and I wondered how long this old shop had been cutting hair. Who knows, maybe it was a barber shop even before the barber was alive. My brother Andy and I wanted flat tops. Sure, it was the late 90’s, but it’s a timeless haircut if you like Americana. The barber said he wasn’t sure if he could keep doing them since he had a bad back and may not be able to work at all much longer. His haircut was unique because at the end, he used a large vibrator on my Dad’s neck, head, and shoulders. Definitely old timey! Once, when we were halfway through casual haircut conversation, he revealed that not only is his last name Starr, but he’s the brother of Ken Starr, the guy who blew the whistle on President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky’s sex scandal. What are the odds of this man cutting our hair so soon after the scandal? Clinton was recently impeached, and now Ken Starr’s brother was using a vibrator on my neck and shoulders. It was a little odd yet surreal.

Little did I know how many more strange tales that town would give me in my high school and college years. Some may see Abilene as an old cattle town, a good place for BBQ, and the birthplace of Jessica Simpson. For me, it became a place of learning and a second home where I made friends and memories.
