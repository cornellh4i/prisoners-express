**“Sly & Sinister” by Cambren Thomas**

Fenwood Fox had found the perfect score. Without any foreboding difficulties, he cased the place, *took care of* the maid hen, and took over the senior care duties for the invalid recluse Gertrude “Golden Gertie” Goose. He was after a rumored golden hoard, which was secreted in her vast estate...somewhere. Very early on, however, Fenwood’s hunt for treasure was becoming increasingly hapless...and he was growing weary of keeping up appearances.

Things changed one afternoon, however, while Fenwood was giving Gertie his typical diatribe of verbal abuse, and feeding her the usual meager portion of porridge and pills. Midway through feeding, the old bird soiled herself. Fenwood contemplated smothering her right then and there, but he sighed through his disdain and went about peeling back her layered meld of blankets. He expected nothing more than a routine fecal foray, but the flash of something golden caught his eyes. An egg, about half the size of Fenwood’s head, rested in the stainless steel nest of Gertie’s bedpan. Fenwood snatched it up swiftly and shot off to his room.

That night, Fenwood slept soundly, with glistening 24 karat ovals floating and playfully taunting him in his dreams. He decided, the next morning, that he would continue to amass the golden morsels for the rest of the month--*then* he’d roast Gertie, and devour her with a delectable truffle risotto. He went about his daily tasks with a sufficient sum of relished fervor. He even made sure that Gertie received a little fresh outside air; and though his hiny hands and legs had a most laborious time pushing Gertie’s carriage around, he had a little pep in this step and even whistled a rousing tune as he wheeled her about.

Come supper time, Fenwood was teeming with anticipation as he fed Gertie. Then he waited, and waited, and waited some more, but nothing happened. Fenwood was pained and perplexed. It was the same porridge, the same concoction of “maintenance” meds. What had changed? Was the golden, buried at the back of his bureau, a farce?

Fenwood stared at the expressionless creature lying before him, and became enraged.

“Where is my egg you old wretch,” he sneered.

Gertie neither blinked, nor moved to refute him.

“I know you are in there somewhere *Golden Gertie*,” he snidely continued.

“Now push out my little *golden* delight, or *I* will be having foie gras for supper.”

Fenwood licked his chops for dramatic effect, although his theatrics went unheeded. He threw the bedpan across the room; then paced the room for a while, deliberating, and settled on gorging the old goose until the egg burst out of her.

Fenwood sprang downstairs on all fours--yelping like the beast he was, the voracity in him yearning to be satiated. When he returned, his eyes nearly bounded from their sockets, as they wrapped around the lofty pile of golden shelled orbs lying on the bed before him in a wide platter. Gertie was nowhere in sight, and Fenwood half hoped that the old goose had spontaneously combusted. He was so thrilled, so elated, so absorbed--he dropped the bowl he was holding, and practically floated to the treasure trove. He did not hear the door close behind him...or feel the syringe penetrate his skin.

Fenwood gradually returned to consciously on the hard floorboards, and peered through the half open slits of his eyelids into a visage of dread, That beak. Those feathers. He knew them--knew *her*. He did *not* want to know the knife she was holding.

Gertie smirked at him, stretching her wings, and wiggling her webbed toes merrily.

“Welcome back...Fen who killed my friend.”

Fenwood tried to move, but something, an anesthetic perhaps, was causing a miscommunication between his brain and limbs. He heard a clattering above him, and could only move his eyes to look up at the swaying mass of glowing golden oblongs ready to drop upon him. Gertie walked over to a taut piece of rope connected to the platter of gold.

“Quite naturally, I’ve always loved Mother Goose. So, I thought it would be fitting to write a nursery rhyme for your eulogy...Goodbye Fen,” Gertie said contentedly, as she cut the rope.

A juicy, bone-crushing, thwack reverberated throughout the manor...then quieted. Gertie pierced the silence with her limerick…

*Fenwood, Fenwood,*

*Always up to no good.*

*So clever, so crafty, so cunning.*

*Do better, he should*

*But GREED tainted his blood,*

*And he died for his love for money.*
