**“You owe it to yourself” by Justin Phillips**

Everyday my alarm wakes me up at 6:20 am. It’s loud enough for me to hear through my ear plugs that I wear every night, or else I’m kept awake by the disgusting noises of men who have long ago forsaken their health and hope.

I go to breakfast despite the unoriginality and lack of quality in the menu. I go because if I don’t eat; I will lack the ability to focus at my job.

As a legal assistant in the prison law library, I want to help others as best I can. I need to be able to focus.

I am not guilty, and it would be absolutely pointless to profess this if it were a lie. Being wrongly convicted to prosecutor misconduct and grossly ineffective assistance has allowed for me to see the perversion of our criminal justice system, thus distrusting it entirely. And so, do I just hope that this new attorney for appeal performs his civic duty diligently? (Like that has worked out so well up to this point).

6 months into a 200 month sentence for crimes I did not commit, I was depressed to say the least, walking circles around the yard. I came to a cognitive crossroad; Do I give into this depression? Cope by living in distraction, neglect my health, my hygeine, and slowly kill myself as so many of these guys do? Or, do I do something about this? Do I take it upon myself to learn the rules of their game, understand how they continue to get away with this, and how to combat it?

In this, I hope to inspire YOU.

It took me 8 months to learn how to read case law, statutes, and court rules. Grasp all that information and apply it in drafting a pro se appeal that is so good that my attorney needed to adapt it into his own brief. You can do this too!

This is how I did it: The most important step by far is to be kind and get to know people. Church worked best for me and I highly recommend it. You can learn from all the men who have actually worked their appeals. In this, you’ll get a lot of opinions, and it is paramount that you compare and contrast the information given to you, so get to know more than just a few people. Decipher their facts from opinions and see who is spiteful or delusional versus who is genuinely knowledgeable and helpful.

Throughout this process make law library appointments for a legal assistant like myself. We are very informed and will guide you through a step-by-step plan.

If you are wrongly convicted, or only partially guilty, or excessively sentenced; don’t let the possible stigma of your charges or the overall seeming complexities daunt you. Please do something.

If you are guilty or have exhausted your appeal options; please help those who are motivated.

I see so many people get new trials or sentence reductions when they put in the work. You can too.
