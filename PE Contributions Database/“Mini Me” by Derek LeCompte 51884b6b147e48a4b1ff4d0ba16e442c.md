**“Mini Me” by Derek LeCompte**

I met my sister once before I came to prison. My mother abandoned me when I was in my early teens. So, you can imagine my shock when word came indirectly to me that she was pregnant. I contacted mutual friends on a quest to find where she was, and that is when I found out I had a baby half-sister. My entire youth I was an only child, yet I used to beg my mother for a sister - as if it was that easy. She’d always tell me that she had her “tubes tied.” I hated my mother for abandoning me, yet I had to meet the sister I prayed for.

I went with my girlfriend at the time, Erica, to visit. I couldn’t look at my mother when we arrived and Erica was the perfect distraction. I went right to the floor by the kitchen where what looked like a car seat was. My sister opened her eyes and seemed to imprint on mine as she smiled. I melted and fell in love. She grasped my pinky and sucked on it as she continued to smile at me with her eyes.

Leaving was just as hard as going. Tears fell, because I needed to love my sister as a big brother, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t relive the pain I’d endured at the hands of my mother; I could only hope that she didn’t repeat the same mistakes.

I wish I had stayed. The man my mother abandoned me for and who was the father to my sister abandoned them. He tossed them aside with nothing, when my sister was only a year old! I only found out about this after I was already in the County Jail for this crime. I was broken, suicidal, and hopeless. Then, a week into my incarceration, they visited me. Even through the window that separated us, she had that same love in her eyes that she had had during our first interaction. She saved my life as she made me imaginary cupcakes and babbled on about her day as a two-and-a-half year old.

My sister to this day inspires me. She’s 22 now. She lost her brother to prison at 2, lost her father to alcoholism at 6, and has been caring for her sick, dying mother for five and a half years. Yet, she still loves me. She’s going to college. She’s smart. She’s beautiful. She’s everything I always strived to be. We have nearly all the same likes and dislikes, same attitude, and same silliness. She’s my Mini Me.

I love you Christina. You’ll always make me the proudest big brother in the world.
