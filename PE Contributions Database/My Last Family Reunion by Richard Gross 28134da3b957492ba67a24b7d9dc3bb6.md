**"My Last Family Reunion" by Richard Gross**

My grandmother had sent word that she expected to see me at the family reunion. I had to go, no one said no to Grandma. Besides she was the only one in the family who actually loved me. So I hitched a ride with my parents, which was a mistake. They didn’t bring a food contribution because they weren’t going to eat there. I hoped to eat a lot there and wanted to stop at a store to pick up chips and snacks as my contribution. My Dad did not stop, he never wanted to make an unscheduled stop on any journey. My Mom always wanted to stop at every roadside stand selling flowers or produce. In their whole life together he never stopped.

We arrived at the county park empty handed and off to an awkward start. We were informed that everyone was to bring a contribution regardless of whether they were eating or not. I told them how Dad refused to stop at a store for me. I don’t know if anyone heard because no one responded. It often seemed as though people in the family couldn’t hear me. Maybe somehow the long hair covering my ears made it harder for them to hear.

I said hello to Grandma and gave her a hug. She told me to get something to eat, and since nobody said no to Grandma, I did as she said. I ate several times that day. I also took several walks into the woods where I took a few tokes on my bowl. Maybe more than a few; smoking herb in nature always relaxed me.

I made the rounds, saying hello to aunts, uncles, first cousins, and second cousins. There was a group of people at every reunion who sat by themselves and didn’t speak to the rest of us. I never found out how, or if, we were related to them. To this day, I don’t know who they were.

I talked to an uncle who was predicting a revolution in America. He would not say who was going to revolt, or why. No one else thought that there was going to be a revolution, and there hasn’t been one in the decades since.

I talked to a cousin who came up from Florida. She is a successful vet at a horse racing track down there. She confided in me that she is glad to live 1,000 miles away from the family. Most other cousins stayed in the area and focused on having many children. Their children were polite and well behaved.

I remember a family reunion back in the 70’s when all of the children got into a pebble throwing battle. We thought it was hilarious, our parents did not.

I felt out of place at the reunion, I never went again. The end.
