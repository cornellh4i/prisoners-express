**My Body by Bobby Coil**

During my time in prison I have learned that “your body is a temple.” Now I don’t mean that in a sense, a lot of people do, I mean that to me. I try to stay healthy and fit! Because you only get one chance to live a potentially long-life.

One thing here in this legalized torture, Shaq Wisconsin calls a prison system. I’ve learned to take my mind out of the dark state of depression. Release my body’s natural chemicals! Makes me feel good, almost a healthy high. And at age 30, I feel 23 again and prison has preserved me so well I actually look it, too. Crazy, huh? That’s what it takes to push yourself. Be healthy, fit, burn your way through fat… I do a lot of cross fit and strength training. However, I am also fortunate enough to be blessed with a high functioning metabolism, eat what I want, but punish my body: everything from crossfit to interval training, isometrics, Jiu Jitsu basic moves, yoga meditation. You name it, I’ll do it!

And I’m close to release in 14 months. I will be focused on designing my own fitness program called “B.C. Fit” to help those who want to stimulate their minds and bodies and be fit. America needs more fitness to stop obesity and diseases, heart problems too! This will be my way to give back even though I’m only in prison for property crimes. I’ve done almost 10 years in a system that is purly psychologically evil and seen what effects it has from family loss to suicide. I’ve worked out with ex-military, convicts, loonies. Just remember, #U CAN …

When I get my personal fitness certification, I feel I can help make a difference, so if you like this and want to write me, ie. any hot ladies. I’m a good pen-pal and I’m handsome and single. For real, anyone just write me.
