**Sisters by Terry Lytle** 

It was country. Not deep country, but rural. Five and ¾ mile towards one town; about six miles towards the other town in the opposite direction. Old two-lane highway to get there, and even older two-lane rural road turn-off. And then there’s the driveway…

It’s more like a path. See, it’s the driveway for these two old houses… that just keeps going. Weeds and straw grass so high in the middle of the two wheel rut, it’s downright loud, slapping underneath the ‘76 Camaro my mom had- slipping transmission and chainsaw-scratching flywheel and all…

And then after the first curve to the right, you gotta cut the wheel back to the left- where, now- you’re between a field of taters (I think they were Red-Irish that year) and a deep dark woods of tall, thick Caroline pine trees, so dense that you don’t know there’s rusting cars and trucks in there… And after this straight away, you got a ninety degree turn back to the right (which is a “bottom,” that covers up the fact that there’s a pond ten paces into them woods with water blacker than coffee, cowboy style). With this straightaway, woods on your left, fields on your right- then boom!...

A two-bedroom trailer, (small bath) so old it doesn’t have a backdoor: it’s on the front, just like the door that opens into the living room… And I mean LIVING ROOM- because it’s the room I almost lost my bestest friend, my greatest babysitter, and my biggest bully- my sister, Toni.

We’d been “fussin’” about some such bulljive, that was so unimportant, that I can’t even remember what it was… and one of them older dudes from up the path was out in the yard, tryin’ to get fresh with my older sister. Don’t get me wrong, I was only ten- that made her fourteen.

And it must’ve been at least a half hour later- but this dude’s about eighteen… and a big sumbitch- too big to fight, I’ll tell ya that.

But when I stick my head out the “front” door, “checking the scenery” (peeping game) Toni says ‘they’re fine’, ‘they’re just talking’… and about five minutes later, this muthafucka’s tryna kiss my sister! (WTF?!)

We’re in the “Boonies”- don’t have a phone- and my momma’s working at a sweet potato wearhouse at least 25 miles away, with a different area code, so even if I could use one of my neighbors’ phone (WHAT!! NEIGHBORS??!!) they’d act kinda funny (as John Cougar Mellencamp sang) about it being: long distance... So I told him to leave.

Which is when- WHY!- shit hit the fan. He’s saying he ain’t leavin’- Toni’s saying ain’t nothing going on! Hollering at me…

So I go down the hallway, open the closet, stand on my tippy-toes and grab the milk crate that’s on the top shelf, with this and that… and momma’s .22 caliber revolver, long rifle- hollow points. Six shots… kinda quiet gun… and I open that other front door, and say “You think I’m playin?!!” They get the message.

But I had pointed the gun at him- and when Toni got hysterical screaming “what’re you doing” ……. I pointed it at her…

I went down the back steps, walked up on them- him, really. I cannot remember, but I think I bust a shot… not ‘at him’ but at him, know what I’m saying?... He takes his ass up that path…

Of course I went and put the gun up- but I don’t remember doing it. I just know I must have… because I went and used the toilet, and when I came out the bathroom, walked up the hallway- there’s Toni (sister of mine!) sitting in the chair in the living room.. With the pistol in her hand!, saying “you wanted to shoot me?” very calm, very quietly, when I had stopped stepping… us, eye to eye… saying she’d do it herself then (some such shit as that)...

I “knew”... I don’t know what that fuck, exactly, I knew, but I just did… so I kept trying to get the gun from her- she never got up out of the chair- but there was a lot of pushing me away with her other arm, shoving… and she pointed the gun at me, two handed (just like she had been taught how to shoot, target practicing) and time stopped…

It broke my heart that my bestest friend- my big sister!- wanted me dead; to shoot me. It froze me, all ten years of me… yet, I turned as cold when Toni turned the gun on herself, two-handed, and pushed the trigger back with her thumb…

The truth: I “knew”... I just, knew. Somehow…

I had turned from her, when she turned the gun to herself- I ran over to the couch. I was cryin’ like a bitch, screaming “No! Don’t!” And plugged my ears with my fingers… and buried my head in the laundry we were supposed to be folding, when I seen her thumb the hammer back…… and it locked. Cocked.

It sounded like one of those plastic cap-guns, with the red circle 8-shot caps circles you put in the revolver…

And I hated the world and God Himself, ever since…. Maybe still do;I’m not sure, now- stirring all these feelings up. You ever tried to write, with 33 year-old tears flooding your visual?

I shot out the door so hard and fast, the screen door slapped the trailer’s side loud as the gunshot. I screamed… I hollered… “HELP!!” over and over… and over… and ran straight up the field- barefooted, across rocks and broken bottle-glass… through a backyard of grass full of sand-spurs (STICKERS!) across that ole-two lane blacktop (it must’ve been 150 degrees, it was so God-Damn-Hot!)- and beat and banged on a latched screen door, until somebody came…

Momma…

Rescue-squad…

Hospital- weeks and weeks…

Intensive care- weeks and weeks…

Toni-

I’m glad you survived! I realize I’m hard to understand, but you are my sister, who I love very much. I’m proud of you… Know this: the world still kinda sucks, but God ain’t so bad- if not for Him, who really knows the outcomes- different, of that day…

Your brother
