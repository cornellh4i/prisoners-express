**“Rescued” by Shannon Richardson**

I have never needed rescuing more in my life than I do now. Before I was arrested, I was in an abusive marriage. I prayed and prayed to get out alive. Now, I wish I wouldn’t have because a life without my children is the worst hell imaginable.

In the beginning, there were excuses for a husband: he was tired, he was stressed, he went from having no children to my 5. He killed our cat that had been a part of our family for 7 years because she sneezed on him. There were no more excuses available for him.

I began planning our escape. He found out. He surrounded the house with cameras, put a recorder in the house and my can. I couldn’t make a move without him knowing it. I got a PO Box and continued attempting to escape. He found out again and tried to drown me. I have no doubt he would have succeeded if my youngest son hadn’t woken up yelling mommy. I never knew it was possible to be raped by your own husband. Sure, I had heard stories of it happening, but I am ashamed to say I simply didn’t believe it. I found out the hard way just how possible it is. As a result of this, I got pregnant--and that made him even worse.

I went to the police for help. They didn’t. I went to his father, a preacher, for help. He told my husband everything I said to him. Great man of God, huh?

I was later arrested. Maybe you consider that being rescued, but this is worse than anything Nathan could do. Life without children is the worst hell I could ever imagine. Some would say I was rescued, I disagree.
