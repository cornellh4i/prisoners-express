I hate breakfast here on Telford Unit! Above all else, I can't stand pancakes! It is nothing to be served 3 burnt or half-cooked pancakes with 1 ounce of yellow grits and another ounce of fruit 9 days in a row for breakfast. Some years, they will feed us pancakes for breakfast two weeks in a row, then backdoor with 2 slices of white bread (not toast), oatmeal, fruit, and some water-down gravy for breakfast.

When the feds were still watching the state run prisons after the Ruiz V. Estelle lawsuit, it was a joy to eat breakfast because you got full. You get more food in a breakfast happy meal at McDonald's than on this unit. I hate breakfast. I still remember the days cinnamon rolls and waffles were served with 2 cereals, milk coffee, and fruit 5 days a week. Now we get milk one or two times, every two to three weeks.

We might get butter on our breakfast trays twice a month. Jelly? You can forget about that. They would rather mix the jelly with peanut butter and give it to people on meat free or pork free diets than put it on our breakfast trays. As soon as I get out of prison, I donâ€™t want to see another pancake for breakfast for as long as I live. Thirty-two more months and I plan on having a real breakfast with sausage, bacon, proteins, donuts, omelets, French toast, waffles, real milk instead of powder milk, and dag- gummit fresh squeezed orange juice! Did I mention bagels with cream cheese, hashbrowns, and trix cereal. Now that is what I call a breakfast!
