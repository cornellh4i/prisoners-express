**“Harvest Lost” by John Naylor**

Never could he have imagined what fell on his shoulders. Cancellations and unpaid bills. How to survive. The water reminded him of bobber fishing at the lake in his youth. Through with came such depression. With such heaviness of heart he may sink like a stone to the bottom. Breathing water like air with no struggle. If only the release of death was like a hot shot of heroin, he’d push off the pier and into the dark depth of the mountain lake.

Life was bigger than him now. He had his family to think about. It seemed so easy on the Discovery Channel. Self-made millionaires. He fell to the number one threat in the dope game—the treachery. And the treachery was here to stay. “Go to college,” his mom had said, but he followed one of his friends instead. On to the green rush. The friend couldn’t re-enlist if it all went south after the dishonorable discharge. And with his contempt for authority, medical records, and criminal record that route was out of the question for him too. The burner phone was still in his left hand. He thought of the terrible veteran suicide rate. He needed to call his bro and tell him what happened.

That it’s all gone. Credits non-existent. Products and plants gone. Even the laptops and equipment. All this injury and only two weeks away from homelessness. He feared he’d kill himself. Then not only would he grieve that tragedy, but only be more alone in this.

“She swore she’d keep her mouth shut.” he said aloud. Yet he blamed himself for bringing her there. For telling her what his vision and passion were. Still he remembered what she’d said before he’d checked her and told her the rules of the game…

“Oh my God! I’m gonna tell all my friends!”
