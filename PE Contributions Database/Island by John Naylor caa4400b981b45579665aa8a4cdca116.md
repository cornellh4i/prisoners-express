**"Island" by John Naylor**

I stood outside the white 1988 Chevy suburban. My wrangler shorts close to my skin in the heat of the southwest. Was it Arizona, was I in New Mexico? The sun beating on the cactus cared not. The bluest sky imaginable means no atmosphere, low humidity, and high ultraviolet radiation. I stared trance-like as others took pictures. I caught the occasional whiff of my dad's cigarette on the breeze. And despite the vast miles of untouched terrain and mountains, not all are untouched. The sun bounces off Indian ruins. They're easily over 150 years old. It's like a scene out of a strange independent film. Everyone gawking at a decimated native people's natural range. The sun beating down on it all. Perhaps on the bones of whoever built this dilapidated stone structure. I don’t know if they ran out of the resources. I don’t know if they were running off by the Calvary or if they could even bury their family. Perhaps their death song was wailed from this very spot. Now its covered by a highway and gawking tourists. Of which I was, though, perhaps somewhat more relevant. It all seemed a story. A story we may never know. I didn’t know such places still existed, let alone as part of a lookout area, a photo stop for tourists. If their spirits still wandered this adulterous scene of strange beauty, I wouldn’t be surprised.
