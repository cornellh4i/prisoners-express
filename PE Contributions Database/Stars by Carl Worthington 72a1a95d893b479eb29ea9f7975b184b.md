**Stars by Carl Worthington**

Looking up at the stars in the sky, I contemplate my place in this universe of infinite wonders.

Our sun is a common yellow dwarf star. Our Milky Way Galaxy has about 3 hundred billion stars of every size and variety. There are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe, each with as many stars as our own. How many planets surround these stars is unknown, but it must be an enormous amount. Are we alone? Highly unlikely. Numbers don’t lie.

We are all made of “star stuff.” The elements in our bodies were formed in the heart of a star. I realize now, while I look up at the stars, that any feeling of separation is an illusion. I *am* the universe contemplating *itself*. If only the rest of humanity could realize the truth: we are one. All humans, animals, plants, the Earth, moon, and stars are all one living, breathing, sentient organism. No single component of this symphony called existence could be without all the others.

D.N.A. studies have proven that all humans have descended from perhaps a dozen of the first humans on Earth. We’re all related, yet we have wars, racism, poverty, homelessness, and famine. Some people have more than they will ever need, while others have nothing at all. We’re a family, but we treat each other like strangers.

Look up at the stars tonight and remember that as you stare at the universe, the universe also stares at you. The stars are our mirror. Can we, as a species, look ourselves in the eye and be proud of our works? We can do better. We *will* do better. The stars are watching.
