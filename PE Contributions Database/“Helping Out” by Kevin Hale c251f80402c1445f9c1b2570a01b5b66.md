**“Helping Out” by Kevin Hale**

Growing up like I did was a struggle from day to day, so once I landed myself in prison I was used to adversity and maintained my “go get it” outlook on life. With that said, help was a foreign subject to me. Both giving and receiving.

Becoming a mirror image of the gangsters in my neighborhood led me to become someone else; not myself. Time spent away from everyone and everything I know led me to the realization that I didn’t know myself. When asked who I was I could only answer with the name of the gang I belonged to.

I saw families on television and thought, “Is that what it’s really like?” I wondered what would have been if I were one of them, leading me to want to find the me I never had the chance to be.

In this process I studied many religions and philosophical views; however, I always felt like an outcast. One day I picked up a Pagan Newsletter and that’s where I found myself. I’ve since read anything I could find on Asatru, Odinic beliefs, and the Norse Gods and Goddesses. Through doing this I learned about my Nordic Ancestors, and this in turn taught me about myself.

Though growing up as I did I viewed any kind of codependency as a weakness, so my growth came to a halt. This older gentleman put it to me in words as such: “Them vikings you love so much weren’t all warriors, some of them had to row the boat! Everyone needs help sometimes.” Even though I viewed this man in a state of respect, I couldn’t bring myself to talk to him and ask for his help.

In the religion of Astru there is a big emphasis on ancestors, so I took my plea before the Ancestral Spirits. I asked them to help me find myself and shortly thereafter started corresponding with an Asatruar Holyman. He himself went through similar trials of not knowing one’s self, and in turn helped me to find Kevin.

Now that I know who I am as a man, life is a lot smoother and easier. Codependency isn’t a weakness and in order to help others, we must first help ourselves out of our own way. Since Drighten Joe’s helping me and the Gods and Goddesses intercession in my life I now know me. I found the boy inside and the man no one got to see.
