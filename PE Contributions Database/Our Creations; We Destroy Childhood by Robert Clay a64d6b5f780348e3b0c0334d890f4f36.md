Our Creations; We Destroy Childhood by Robert Clayton

Everybody in America uses nicknames. Some have more than one. It helps when you’re: trying to develop a new or falsified persona, evade arrest, duck out on obligations, or just fit in. Do you have one? I have seventeen. Seriously! And I’ll even tell you why. I shall not allow thee to take my name in vain. For that is why I am serving forty years in the wilderness for murder.

Many teenagers spend most of their time trying to find something valuable from without. For during that period of time, disillusionment forces a still developing mind that what one senses proves what’s really within. Which moves us on to a greater form of stupidity self-manifested.

Criminals believe nicknames bring them closer quicker to becoming even greater criminal masterminds. Even though, lil Pookie-n-them, only steal from the dollar store. But don’t forget to add to that fact that they wouldn’t even attempt it before the notion of the nickname painting them in the new light. Sort of a wanna-be’s rendition of the preconceived notion. Could this one day prove nicknames are the true opiate of the masses?

The worst nickname, and the one not self-given, that everyone has come to dread, is the runner. He’s the one that: owes you money, will not have anything to do with his own kids, and calls his very own mother by her first name. He also has the audacity to eat at a restaurant on Father’s Day when it celebrates it as a holiday. Do you know him now?

Within my own family, all of the above culminates into the one true- for lack of belief in cursing- heathen. His given name is Lewis Shufford. A white boy that joined a black gang, then broke into white people’s homes for racial reasons. Named his daughter according to his on-the-run alias. Michael Ballew. Who was his step-brother, by his mother’s second marriage. Left Texas for Brooklyn. Abandoned all his children before the age of two set in. And when he finally did allow his daughter to visit. He taught her: how to worship the Satan, use heroin, and get paid for sexual relations. Mallory Ballew is the mother of two daughters. Love them! Pray for Lewis in his very own.
