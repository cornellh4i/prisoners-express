**“Apologies” by Scott Shultz**

Apologies are nothing more than meaningless human expressions of pointless emotionalisms.

People want you to reassure them about you by telling them you are sorry about something that, due to the fact that it happened in the past, doesn’t exist in reality anymore. Instinctively, people place others into categories based on the others’ past behaviors. A mental probability algorithm pops up in a person’s head every time they do background research on anyone. If you’ve done a thing over and over again, there exists a high probability that you will do that thing again sometime in the future.

And, of course, these mental models are, while not 100% accurate, pretty good to have around. And should be paid attention to.

Actions, not words, define a person. Actions, and not words, define groups.

So why ask for an apology? Apologies are how people attempt to make others feel ok about them. I apologize for my past, now do you feel better? Of course, an apology is just a string of words though. The best apology is the one a person gives by showing you, through his/her actions, that he/she is not following the same course as before.

Exceptions exist within every algorithm. The probability that you’ve changed may be small but it does exist. However, if you haven’t changed (and are still a weirdo) the probability that your apology will be a lie is very high.

So save your apologies.

Show me, just like I’ll show you, that you are the type of person I want to associate with.
