**“Keeping Calm” by Alfred MangaBell**

Keeping calm: to describe a state of situation so alarming to the mind that the person exposed to it would otherwise panic if not for strong self control. There I was many times. However, there is one particular significant instance when I was about 14 years old. Born on the Atlantic Coastal Line in Guinea (West Africa), sea fishing was part of my favorite pastime. One summer evening my friends and I went to the Sea to get some fish from the fishmen’s Pirogue (“Banana Boat”).

The fish from the fishmen’s Pirogue were always the easiest way to catch fish after the fishmen retrieve their daily catching, as there were always plenty of fish they left in the Pirogue, which fish kids like myself would then reach to collect.

This particular evening the Pirogue was close by the shore when my friends and I climbed into it. So busy in amassing our “found treasure” that I did not notice the Pirogue had drifted from shore to ease its way farther out in the Sea. When I felt that I had collected more than enough fish in my bag, I jumped in the water without looking where I was situated in rapport to the shore-thinking that my feet would have landed on the seafloor, I found myself sinking deeper than I expected.

Panic? Well not really. Adrenaline rush? Definitely. For at that precise moment my whole being shifted to the instinct to survive the situation. There I reflexively started moving my hands and feet in a swimming motion to propel myself upward. The situation wasn’t frightening at that particular moment, until my head emerged to find out that the pirogue had indeed drifted far from shore and gravity was strongly pulling me downward. Not to mention that darkness had fallen upon the whole Port, so there was no one near to see me, nor were my friends inside the Pirogue in sight.

Keeping calm. A few minutes later I was walking on the sand with my fish bag and all its contents, my heart pounding in my chest so strongly that I could hear and feel the pressure on my ears. If it wasn’t for “keeping calm” that day, panic would have cost me myself. Without anyone near to see me, it would have been even more costly to my family and friends because the Sea is able to take the human Soul and forever keep the body. However, by exercising self-control I succeeded in keeping calm and thus Mother Sea released me unharmed.
