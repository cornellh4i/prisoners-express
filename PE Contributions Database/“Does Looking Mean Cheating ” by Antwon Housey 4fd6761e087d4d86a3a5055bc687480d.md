**“Does Looking Mean Cheating?” by Antwon Howey**

A brilliant sunny day, while in the festive company of a new girlfriend, this sexy petite redhead passed us by. I immediately noticed how radiant her pale, but slightly sunkissed skin shone. Because of my natural curiosity, I wanted – no, I needed to know what her figure looked like as she walked away. Now this is where things become more complex. My dilemma is, “Do I respect my new girlfriend’s insecurities , or do I embrace my curious nature and take a look?” I don’t have much time to decide because the sexy redhead is only ten footsteps away from turning the corner. If I never get the chance to take this look, it will plague my curiosity with an insane vengeance. Damn if I don’t, one, two, three. Maybe I should try to do it inconspicuously. Naw, that will mean that my intentions were not to get caught. She (the redhead) should have about three more steps left until she has to turn the corner. Here goes nothing, worst case she’s upset for a while. However, the image of that redhead’s ass will forever be imprinted upon my subconscious.
