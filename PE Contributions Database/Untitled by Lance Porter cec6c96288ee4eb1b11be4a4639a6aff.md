**Untitled by Lance Porter**

Sometimes the world becomes too much and we have to take a time out. Sit back, let the deadlines fade and just watch the world grind on. This is the time to reflect on the important things in life, maybe think about those people who mattered most in our lives.

In this world of constant connections to social media we need to find this time to connect to ourselves. If more people did this I believe there would be less impulsive decisions that tend to hurt us all. So stretch out and maybe make some pictures of the clouds like many of us did as kids. Weâ€™ll all be better for it.
