**Helping Hand by Christopher Young**

First they looked out onto the frozen valley. A large herd of elk starting up the farmside of It, back up to higher ground. “If we pace ourselves and save our strength for the closer chase, we will be eating our fill by high noon,” said the alpha male wolf.

“I agree with you,” comes from the black wolf, his second in ranking order.

“You two youngsters try to keep up. Do not run ahead for it might spook the herd. Then we may not eat all today. So set your pace with my self,” the alpha continued.

Thus the four members of the pack set out to hunt. The alpha female was in the opposite direction teaching the younger group to hunt rabbits and field mice.

The group heads out across the snow filled volley as the last young elk bull passes into the tree-line on the other side of the small valley. The third in line, a young member of the pack spoke up.

“Dad. Why do these brown animals leave such deep footprints?

“They are rather large for their size.”(Alpha male thinking a moment)

“Maybe because of how tall they are. Maybe because they weigh so much more than us. As you must have noticed two things here. First, because we’re so light in weight our paws barely sink into the snow. Second, those animals spook so easy, plus they have a hard time walking in the snow as well. If we do this right, we can sneak up on them before they know we’re about.” The alpha male explained.

The quadruplet stopped at the bottom of the rise for a quick breather. Then they pushed onward. The alpha male picked out a big cow that walked with a limp. The alpha cut her off from the herd with help from his second in command. The two younger wolves slowly followed waiting for the signal to help with kill.

The alpha male circled his prey. Second in command kept nipping at the cow elk’s hooves. He lets out a short bark. Now it was on. The two younger wolves came sprinting in for the kill.

The alpha male jumped for the cow elk’s throat. She moved just in time. The youngest member of the group jumped. His teeth sank into the cow’s neck. He hung on for the life of him. The older youngster got hold of a back leg. So did the second in rank. The elk tripped and fell over on her side in the snow.

The alpha male lunged. Got another bite Into the cow's neck. After a few minutes more she stopped fighting and lay still. As the way things work In the wild, the alpha started ripping the cow to get to the meat. Once he has had his fill, did the other eat their fill.

On the way home they steady paced themselves. There would be plenty of meat for the rest of the pack for tomorrow.

“Thanks for the help you youngsters. You have proven to be worthy of becoming the pack’s hunters. Just remember your place so there will be no problems with other pack members and you’ll have no problems. If you want to venture out on your own, you have my blessings. The alpha female understand, so will your baby-sitters. For it is a way of life for us in this world. If we ever run across you and recognize you, you may come back for a while. But if you are gone too long the other pack members will see you as a threat. Again, thanks for your helping hands today. For on the morrow the pack will eat its fill. By the way, you two youngsters are on babysitting duty on the morrow.” The alpha told them.

“When you leave your pack, good hunting, and watch your back,”

The second in rank added to the alpha male’s words.

So the four wolves paced themselves, heading for home as the sun started to drop from the sky.
