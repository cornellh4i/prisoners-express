**“Rebekah the Heartbreaker” by Marlon A. Melendez**

Death held him as he was awakening to the last moments of his life. He’d lived well. Good enough for him at least. He would always tell people that he wanted to enjoy all that life had to offer. However, his idea of what life offered him was women. As many as he wanted, whenever he wanted. His “thing” was to “conquer hearts” and squeeze “as much pleasure and love” as he could out of his conquests. Then move on to the next.

This day the gloved hands of Death held him. Retribution. His life was gonna end.

“Why do you wear gloves?” he asks.

“No fingerprints,” she responds.

“Death has no fingerprints?” he states both as a statement and in question. He pauses to study the garments that Death is wearing. She’s wearing a shawl over her head and her face is covered by what can only be described as a thin fabric sort of ski mask. But unlike a ski mask, only part of her nose is exposed. A loose all-black fitting robe covered her entire body.

“Death, you’re a woman?” he asks after his observations of Death’s dark veiled attire. She laughs at him. What a question. She can almost see the wheels turning in his head about to try and conquer Death’s heart.

“I’m not Death, but you will die by my hands,” she says.

He gives her a look of confusion. He makes an effort to move but it’s in vain. All that he manages to move around his his head.

“Who are you?!” he says in shock and very much feeling like a fool. “I can’t move,” he cries out. How did he get here, he wonders. His thoughts were hazy as if he were coming off a drug.

She lets out another laugh and looks down at his terrified face. Her laugh was a roaring loud and it amplified his fear. He continues thinking that his had to be Death. He was trembling now.

In brief, Rebekah, “Death,” had gotten into his house while he laid in bed passed out drunk. She injected him with a syringe full of a drug that would keep him paralyzed from the neck down for as long as she need him to be.

He was helpless now. It’s her turn to be in control, his grip on her shattered heart was over with.

The man made every effort to move but it was pointless. All his attempts only frustrated him and filled him with more panic.

“You will die with a broken heart,” she tells him while placing her hand on his chest.

“Why are you doing this, who are you?” he asks pitifully. She doesn’t answer. The soon to be dead man simply starts shouting insults at her. Not a single disparaging word is spared. His mouth was a machine gun of insults.

His anger and frustration excited her. Every word was fuel for her need to end his life.

“Tell me more my darling,” she yelled over him, “I love your pain and want your hate.” Another laugh Rebekah’s vision turned red. It was like looking through blood coated eyes. It all started playing back in her mind. The way he manipulated her into loving him, knowing damn well that he had no intention on loving her in return.

“I was fooled,” she thought to herself, “lured into a trap of heartbreak.”

The men she fell in love with always managed to possess her mind. She was no angel and they liked that. They would channel her indecencies, daringness, and wicked thoughts. Unable to do it on her own, this made her love the men that dug deep and discovered her hidden malevolence. But they would leave her when her love interfered with her appetite for evil. The heartbreak would tear her world apart and completely collapse her mind into a state of pure hate. Then another man would come and tune into her bad ways. The heartache would be buried under yet another short lived love. Once more indulging in the sinful life. The life where sin was the sustenance of her love.

Until enough was enough. A heart can only be broken so many times. It was with this man that now laid bare and immobilized before her that she’d decided to master her cruel nature.

It took her some time to finally get to him. There was a long list of men that she first had to get to. To show them that she alone could conduct her wickedness without the need of their manipulations.

But it was him, the coward before her trembling, that led her to define what love truly was. Love was needy and self serving; a sacrifice of one’s secret needs. Love forfeits a person’s independence as well, because you have to surrender to someone. Therefore, love is self-defeat, a slavery of emotions and feelings.

Love, Rebekah though, was what had gotten them both where they were at now. Love can bring forth agony; you fall in love, you fall.

“Let me go..,” she managed to hear him say as she drifted in her thoughts.

“Shh... I’m gonna break your heart,” she calmly tells him.

Love and hate both baited her madness. Warm thoughts of being in love and painful memories from love played tug-o-war with Rebekah’s emotions. She felt confused. The rage rose and ceased. Insanity was taking over her and in that cloudy state she heard him say, “Rebekah, is that you?”	The sound of her name being spoken by him gave her those love feelings that she needed and hated. The butterflies in the stomach, the skip of a heartbeat, or the accelerated breathing. He knew it was her in Death’s robe, he knew her.

“Enough!” she yelled at herself. Fury came back. She reached for the long, newly sharpened knife she’d brought with her. The victim was laid out on the floor, pillows under his upper back to elevate his chest for better cutting. She holds the knife tightly with both hands high above her head.

“Nooo, please Rebekah!” he yelled. That feeling of love came again when she heard her name.

“I love you,” she told him with the sweetest voice and truly sincere. Then with one swift and quick move she brought down the knife and stabbed her lover. It easily sunk into his chest, it tore through his skin and found his shocked heart. She repeated the stabbing over and over several times, digging deeper into him. She was breaking and tearing his heart apart. Blood splattered out of the man like a sprinkler and soaked Death’s clothes to a drench.

She saw his mouth moving but didn’t hear what he was saying. He was screaming for her to stop.

The feeling she got as she “broke his heart” was overpowering. She was dizzy with excitement. Until her arms grew sore and tired.

Staring at the gaping wound in her victim she reached into it. His heart was completely torn. Decimated.

She loved that broken heart though. Rebekah picked up her dead lover and held him close to her as blood leaked out of him and pooled around her.

After every kill, every “heartbreak” love seemed possible again. She had not entirely given up on the kind of love that every woman wanted.

But just in case her clothes of Death and sharpened knife was always there if any man went and broke her heart again.
