**Faerie in the mist by Phillip Rath**

“I see you, CJ” said the faerie to a tiny ant crawling across the stamen of the withering flowers.

“I see you, Addison” said the ant to the faerie.

“Why do you crawl around on these dying flowers after they’ve lost their bright blues and soothing aromas?”

Addison inquired of CJ as she bent closer to better hear his response.

“I don’t think they’re dying. There is plenty of life down here where I am. I see some fresh pollen, a few young aphids and chlorophyll enough to keep a vigorous ant like me satisfied for days and days. I have discovered a virtual banquet”, exclaimed CJ, “Why don’t you join me for a meal?”

“Oh you silly ant! Faeries don’t eat aphids or pollen and chlorophyll would probably make us sick! Faeries live on honey from the bees, berries and nuts from Mother Earth and water from our sister the brooks and spring in the meadows”.

Curious, CJ asked, “What is a berry or nut; what’s a bee and where do they get honey and how is a spring your sister? What a confusing would you hive in”.

“CJ, don’t you know anything? The bees are those flying, bugging creatures who visit the same flowers you do. They drink a flower’s nectar and create honey for us. Of course, the earth is our mother and the brooks and streams are our sisters, after all, we’re all family in this world!” Addison gently informed CJ.

“Do you mean that even I am in your family, even though I’m smaller than your fingernail?” inquired CJ.

Laughing gayly, Addison replied “Of course, you silly ant. You are my brother and the earth is your mother. We are all family, although we don’t always act like it”.

“Well, I’ll be jiggered,” responded CJ “I thought the queen was my mother. Are you quire sure?”

“Oh you silly ant! Of course the queen is your mother, but the Earth Mother gives life to us all and has since the beginning of time. We faeries love all creatures as our family so we only eat and drink those gifts freely given by our brothers and sisters. Mother made faeries to speak to all creatures, great and small, to tell them of our family and share the Love of Mother,” Addison told an overwhelmed and confused ant.

“But sister, I have no gifts to give you since you cannot eat aphids nor drink chlorophyll. I’m not a very good brother” CJ sadly moaned.

“But CJ, you’re a great brother! You shared your knowledge with me and made me laugh. You generously offered to share your meal with me and patiently listened to the message Mother sent me to share: My life has truly been enriched by meeting you,” explained Addison.

“Imagine that! A tiny fellow like me has enriched the life of a Faerie! I guess I am a great

brother!” boasted an exuberant CJ. “I am so glad you stopped by to chat, Addison”.

“As am I, little brother. Please take the message of our Great Mother back to your colony CJ, so that all creatures, great and small, might come to accept all beings as their brothers and sisters so we can all live in peace and harmony.”

With that, off went Addison, to spread the message to all the women of the Great Mother.
