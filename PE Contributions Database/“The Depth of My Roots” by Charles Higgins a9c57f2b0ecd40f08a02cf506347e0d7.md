**“The Depth of My Roots” by Charles Higgins**

I’m not a gang member, I’m an organization member. I’m an almighty Latin King, a representative of the A.L.K.Q.N. To be one who truly represents what you claim, you must be organized. Among the organization I represent, the Queens are our sisters.

There are so many who mistake what this actually implies, and I’m sure it’s mistaken in other organizations as well. Ignorance only begets ignorance, which leads to a lot of drama and turmoil that can be often avoided if we as a people learn better.

How would you feel if your grandmother, mother, aunt, or daughter was treated poorly by someone? Disrespected with undue cause, or maybe treated even a little less important, like “f*ck that bitch.” Would it anger you?

Yet, I see it more often than not, someone even from the same organization (family), disregarded for selfish ignorant reasons. Some guys even treat them as just another piece of ass, like a hoe. Is that how you respect your sisters? If it is I would hate to see how you would treat someone else! I understand, no real blood relation, it’s a mutual thing, etc… (blah, blah, blah… excuses) but sisters should never be treated less than you would treat your own blood.

No woman for that matter, should have to bear the weight of ignorance by a disrespectful boy. That’s right, I said it, boy… not a man. A man would know how to treat a woman, especially one that he thinks of as “family.” Let us true men, help elevate our sisters and our women to an equal level. No barriers except the ones we limit ourselves with… ADR/ADC-Rey Chip.
