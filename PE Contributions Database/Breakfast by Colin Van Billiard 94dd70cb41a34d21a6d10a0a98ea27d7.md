**"Breakfast" by Colin Van Billiard**

When I was young, I went to school for cooking. I loved it and learned about the miscellaneous spoons and cups, as well as how to use the oven and stove. I also learned how to clean plates and bowls. One day I was called to cook a breakfast dish. I made an omelette with cheese and sausage. Juice and breakfast turned out to be my specialty. One day I had this Spanish girl with me, and I cooked breakfast for her. She was the love of my life, and meant everything to me, so I made breakfast for her and she loved it. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and to spend it with her was fun. Learning to cook breakfast got me started to learn to cook other stuff, which people also really liked. I cooked a few dishes in prison and people loved it too. When I get out, I want nice kitchen cookbooks and I want to eat and feed my puppies breakfast and even make a new breakfast dish of my own.
