"My Purgatorial Escape" by Nathaniel Dwayne Caetano

Take a look, I mean a good look, at my island and let me know what you think. Doesn’t look all that great at first glance, right? Well, are those birds there? Yes. Life other than me? Are those trees there? Hell yes. Two of them. I even have shelter. Well, you should have seen this island before me. Do you know what it looked like? Nothing. Literally nothing because before me, it didn’t exist. I was floating in this water. This lake of fire, so to speak. Nothing to grasp onto so do you know what I did? I CREATED an ISLAND TO GRAB AHOLD OF. You probably would have called it an island at the time, but it was a self-supported landmass and I latched on. I’ve grown it from there. GOD, I AM, only knows how long I’ve now been at this. It is the power of the mind, the will to live and to survive, that I stand on. This island you see is a testament to my will. I’ve even built a cement structure to take mini strolls on and stars and everything. I was sitting one day and said to myself: You know what? I have drab water and stone. I need a testament to life other than myself and they both sprouted at that time. Now that those birds have arrived, I know the time is fast approaching. Noah and Neo of the Matrix and Bible mashed into one. Instead of sending the dove and it coming back with a testament to life, I and my will created life and the testament so other life found me proving I have been found worthy. This is why you never lose hope. That burning desire in the depth of your heart/soul. It’s there and it is up to you at times to save yourself. Be god: that is why He made you. This is the beginning. It has begun. So now what do you think of my island?
