***Zion* by Alfred McGlory, Jr.**

37 years has passed since the world went under, and only 7,000 people has survived out of the 14 billion people that inhabit the Earth. It happened in the year of 2043 when I heard that the Earth shook 3 times before the Arctic ice started to melt and the seas gave up its waters. My name is Sevyn, and I’m the First Child born here in New Zion. Zion is a sub compound that sits at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean that the United Nations built back in 1945, but it was kept a secret from society. It was built to hold 2.5 billion people and 2 pairs of every animal, bird, and fish to be used for food and to start over when the water dries up. Every year on February 2nd, we celebrate the possibility of Day Land. On that day, we all gather in the Great Aquarium Hall, and a number if announced. Whoever is chosen after the feast will take a sub and emerge to the top to see if there’s dry land.

Those who have went up before has said that it’s so beautiful and that it really has blue skies. Most of us born were born in New Zion and are amazed by such stories. I can’t wait until I turn 40 years old when I’ll be old enough to have a chance to go up.

When one goes up, he must give thanks to the Creator God for saving us, pray 3 times in New Zion, and bow 10 times before returning. So far, there has not been any success in finding land, but anticipation of this great day is a blessing and gives the people in New Zion hopes and dreams.
