“Traveling around this world I have seen mountains, rivers, valleys, luscious landscapes, just to take it all in, bewilders the mind.” - Amelia Earhart

**“Happy Feet” by Jeremy Brown**

These very small feet, formed from the earth mother Gaia, born from a clay mother, perfect in form and rendition. The texture, soft as silk and cows buttery milk. No dirt has been passed on these tiny minute toes The bottom of the feet, lines criss crossing telling the future of this little one’s soul. I see a fierce strength overcome adversity designated by the pattern of two large A’s on each foot near the top. One ‘x’ may suggest an unknown factor in this child’s life. This means that destiny has no hold and the child may choose a path suitable for her. The half-open triangle on the left foot presents a greater lean towards right hemispheric activity in the brain, this child will be very self-fulfilled and creative in every mannerism. On the right foot lies a diagonal line, this rational path is not a straight one but proceeds steadfastly as when the child turns into a teen, a more definitive route will be found as an outlet to her creativity. A bright luminous aura emanates from the top of these feet. She will make happiness for herself and many people. These are joyful and happy feet filled with love, and a fierce determination to succeed at all costs. Amid life is suitable for her living. Although around 50-55 or so, she will have a bout of illness that will last until her death in her late 70s. I can tell if she is a female because the bottom left foot, left index finger, is an upside-down triangle of the goddess. A line crosses through this triangle, a division perhaps or a confusion of sexuality, yet it’s too early to tell. Two very prominent lines on right food, top, near the side purport to be 2 definite children, this one will have. These two children will be connected to her future through a very faint curved line touching the pinky toe and connecting to her destiny line below. She will be fed and not go hungry in her life due to the plumpness of her toes. These are happy feet many blessings will be, will be….

Author’s note: Palmistry is an exact science and works for the feet as well.
