**“Baby Feet” by Gloria Arroyo**

Soft, small, smooth. The hold of newborn baby feet.

Delicate which needs the help of someone’s hands.

Born in this world so innocent and sweet. MY hands on his chest to feel his heartbeat. His baby hands caress my face as I lay my head to sleep to pick him up so he can eat.

The nourishment out of my breast fills his belly to complete satisfaction and, I have to see his reaction when he is happy and filled.

My seed has grown up so fast that I no longer can hold you with my bare hands.

The small feet of a newborn baby have imprinted themselves into my life. You will always be inside my heart. Just as you were inside my womb.

They say life starts at conception, but I am the exception because my life started when you were born.
