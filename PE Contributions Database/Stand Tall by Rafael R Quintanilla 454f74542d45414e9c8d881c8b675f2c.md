**Stand Tall by Rafael R. Quintanilla**

Every night seems colder than the last. Everyday begins with high expectations, but then diminishes into a blur of fading hope. The harsh conditions of this dangerous environment are trying to break me down and cut my life short, but I stand tall.

A bird, flying overhead, triggers my animal instinct to hunt. I crave the weight of my rifles

as the bird fades behind the trees. My stomach growls at the thought of ingesting something other than the snow. I don’t know where I am or how I got here. I’m just glad the wound on my head finally healed. I want to go home, but I don’t know how to get there.

This cave is my best friend and worst enemy at the same time. It shields me from the rising snow and biting gusts of wind, but its mild comfort prevents me from venturing out into the unknown in search of refuge. I’m not sure what to do. I decide to stay. Someone will come, won’t they? I can’t think like that, I need to stay positive. “Someone will come” echoes in my mind like a broken record stuck in a loop. It’s the only thing that blocks out the constant invasion of opposing possibilities.

I hear a faint sound of a propeller. I frantically look around. The acoustics of the mountains make it hard to clarify where it’s coming from. There! I see a small airplane soaring through the trees in the distance. I’m saved! The last argument with my wife was worse than ever. I’m glad she didn’t think I left her. I’m sorry for doubting her. I jump up and down waving my arms, screaming at the top of my lungs. “I’m over here!” I ignore the dizziness. A miscalculated step sends my feet flying over my head. Everything goes black.

I wake up covered in snow. My body’s cold and numb, but also feels like it’s warming up. Hypothermia. The thought of closing my eyes and giving up was quickly overtaken by the image of my wife and kids. I miss them. I must stand tall.

My body erratically convulses as I painfully stand up and limp back to my cave. Tears trickle down my face, more from emotional pain than physical. I’ve always been a tough guy and don’t mind a little pain, but the thought of dying like this had broken my … no! I refuse to let my spirit be broken. I wipe my tears. If this is the end then I’ll go with my chin held high.

I hear branches breaking behind some bushes. I’m too weak to get excited. I stare at the bushes with low expectations. It looks like a brown fur coat. It’s big and walking on all fours. It’s a grizzly bear and it’s staring right at me. The hair on the back of my neck stands up. My heart rate increases. Butterflies flutter throughout my stomach. Chilling waves of fear engulf my body. My flight or fight instinct demands me to respond. Chin up, I remind myself. The bear stands on its hind legs and roars. I’m too weak to run and it’s too late to play dead. I’m left with only one option.

My stomach growls again. It’s hunger, but not just hunger for food. No, it’s deeper than that. It’s a hunger to succeed, survive, and no matter what the circumstances are, never give up.

I pull out my pocket knife, open it, and roar back at the bear. This is my cave. I roar again. The bear hesitates, paces back and forth, then charges at me. Salvia falls off of its teeth, gums, and lips each time its giant paws impact the white earth. The bear is bigger, stronger, and more ferocious, but I know its anatomy. I know exactly how to take it down. The thought of eating bear meat almost brings a smile to my face. I don’t flinch, shake, or doubt that I can succeed. I just intensely look the bear in the eyes, twist the tread of my boots into the earth, and stand tall.

The bear roars again as it picks up speed. My knife is my only hope for survival. I squeeze it tighter. At close range I realize just how big the beast actually is. I raise my arms, preparing to strike. My life flashes before my eyes. Bang! Bang! Bang! Its body tumbles to the ground at my feet as more gunshots finish it off. The adrenaline rush fades. I’m dizzy again. I collapsed and passed out.

I dream of heaven, then awaken to the beautiful face and warm grasp of my wife.

The bear hesitated. I survived. I stood tall.
