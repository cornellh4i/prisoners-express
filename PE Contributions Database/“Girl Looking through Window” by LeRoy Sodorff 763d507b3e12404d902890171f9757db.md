**“Girl Looking through Window” by LeRoy Sodorff**

From the Pacific coast to the Mediterranean Sea and many points in-between, I covered a lot of territory during the first half-century of my life. In all my worldly pursuits,

1. A warehouse of classified military hardware
2. An electronic warfare research facility
3. A carpentry shop
4. The Astrodome
5. And various convenience stores

I broke into several businesses. For every job that was undertaken, I took away a little something from each.

Not given a new life and a change in heart, this second story man breaks into one(1) final business leaving something behind instead…

With no doors to open, buttons to push, no ladders to climb nor steps to be taken, giving rise to the next level, I carefully plot my next move to break into the business at hand. My only recourse leaves me climbing the walls. So, after selecting an old saw, a tight line and a sturdy hook, I begin my rise to the top. Placing one foot in front of the other, I slowly creep upward, but upon encountering an open window of opportunity along the way, I found no need for my skill to make an entrance into a novel world I desire to explore.

After climbing through that window of opportunity and winding my way down the corridors, this second story man slips into the dimly lit office and lays the tools of my trade out on the table…

With a good looking hammer sitting in front

of a screwdriver, and a screw, in the middle of

a triangle, leaning against the bar,

I push my vise aside to reach a new level.

There on the table was a file and an assortment of nuts.

I put a little bit into my bucket-of-bolts, but it needed something more. So I threw in my Awl and added tape for good measure.

Now the plane is on the apron and the ronter

Is on the edge, while the terminal is close of

Hand.

Then I bundled it all up and tied it with a ribbon for there was no longer any red tape.
