**“How Can I Mourn?” by Taheira Hickmond**

How can I mourn?

When I died the same day

How can I mourn?

When I loved what I hate

How can I mourn?

Pain inside

How can I mourn?

With tears uncried

I walk to your grave

To release all my regrets

But then I realized

How can I mourn

What’s not dead yet

The emotions unspoken

The dreams untrue

The lies I tried to hide

Should be buried with you

But instead your grave is empty

And I just can not simply mourn

My heart is torn

Between

Pain and release

Am I a human

Or am I a Beast

Maybe I should just accept defeat

And die alone in my sleep

Without ever mourning

In Peace.
