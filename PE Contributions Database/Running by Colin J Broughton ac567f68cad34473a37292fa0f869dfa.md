**Running by Colin J. Broughton**

Running!

That’s all I’ve been doing.

Running from the police…

Running from bullets … Running!

Could you even tell that I’m white,

Navy blue, with gray stripes?

I’m now crusty, covered in grime, and dry rotted.

I have holes in both soles, but I keep running. 100 MPH!

Homeboy ain’t washed in days! But we running!

House to house. Chasing a Jones that only lasts for ten minutes.

Homeboy keeps a glass pipe in his left sock,

Burning me from time to time.

Just last night we were shot at.

Seems like he can’t keep his hands off of

other people’s stuff. Off to the pawn shop again.

After that we go score. Same thing as yesterday,

and the day before.

I miss being clean and fresh, when homeboy bathed

and took care of the both of us.

Now I’m nothing to him, just like his life seems to be.

Today seems odd. Yes, very odd.

We’ve been in the same brokedown Cadillac

for most of the morning. Homeboy even kicked me off.

I can breathe! But is he breathing?

And why be so nice to me now?

There’s no saving me now,

but maybe a chance for him.

Only if he would wake up!

Only if he would just open his eyes and see.

He’s surrounded by love. His family adores him.

He fears theri help. He hides in shame.

Now I want to hide in guilt.

I’ve assisted him in escaping.

I vow never to run again!

I burst at the seams, and split down the sides.

If you gonna run, run without me.

No more excuses!
