**“I Awaken Thee” by Jeremy Brown**

What happens when we die? It’s as if we are returning to our original state. A state of pure essence soul energy, capable of travelling into the unfathomable reaches of the universe then into the multiverse.

The Atomic Prank Power truly awakened deep within the reaches of our innerselves. The true light of magic of supersoul merges with infinite power, infinite light.
