**“Straightened Out” by Shaun Blake**

****First, I’d like to tell everybody that I am the proud first-time grandfather of a beautiful baby girl---five pounds, 18.2 inches long--born February 1, 2017. My daughter named her Astrid Rose. Cool, huh!

My mother and I were talking about the newest addition to the family. She is the grandmother of eleven and now great-grandmother of ten. I happened to mention my belief that I was the biggest of her six children at birth. This is when my mother laughed at me and said I was mistaken.

“You were the third heaviest and the second largest.”

“But mom, I’ve always believed I was your largest at birth. Everybody told me so.”

“Sorry,” she says smugly. “Listen for a second and I’ll tell you the correct order of my children at birth.” She listed each of our birthdays, weight, and size. “And if you still need more convincing that I’m correct, I can tell you the same information about my eleven grand-children and ten great-grandchildren.

“No, no, that won’t be necessary mom, I believe you,” I answer. We continue our phone conversation and I quickly shift the conversation to a safer topic.

So, take my experience as a lesson: the importance of birthdays for mothers, grandmothers, great-grandmothers, etc., is paramount and very personal. All mother figures are amazing people. I honor you all. Bless you!
