**Arguments by James Bauhaus**

They’re loud, and they are usually about nothing, at least in prison. One memorable argument began out on the basketball court over a small bet. Two whole teams of cheaters and/or welshers could not stop screaming and bellowing about it until long after they’d all been herded by the screws back into their tiny, toilet-sized, 2-man cages. Their shrieks of anguish and accusations continued to echo up and down the narrow hallway, none of them listening, all of them trying to out-shout each other. Ten minutes of this mindless bellowing passed, with no sign of it ever slacking off. Finally, the nazi kids had enough. After trying to reason with the ball-chasers and being ignored, the nazi kids simply began making ear-piercing whistling noirses. Thankfully, it only took a few seconds of whistling to “win” this argument.
