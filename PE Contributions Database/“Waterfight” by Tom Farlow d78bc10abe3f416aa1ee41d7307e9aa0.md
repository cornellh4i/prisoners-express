**“Waterfight” by Tom Farlow**

Grace rose from the grass amid the turmoil of water bombs hurtling through the air. Drops of water were dripping down off of her golden brown locks as a result of Brian’s errant shot hitting the mark. Not to be defeated by the little imp, she ran to the supply barrel nestled in the safety zone and picked three nice, big, ripe balloons for her weaponry on this round.

Finding a route into the fight, she circled the arena until she arrived at an old, knobby elm on the outside of the taped off field, but seeing a possible point of entry because of it. Adjusting her sack to rest behind her, she jumped up to the first level of branches, pulling herself up to a sitting position. Did anyone notice her? She didn’t think so. The mass of kids were mostly yelling like the unruly mob of ballooners they had become, ducking and dodging the projectiles headed their way. She was small so they discounted her most of the time as an easy target.

This would have to be a good barrage from her, however. Once this spot was exposed, it wouldn’t be worth the lunch meat in the cafeteria sandwiches. Yuck! Bologna. She only wished she was allowed more than three balloons. But, rules were rules. The monitor at the ammo vat kept a stern eye on how many were taken by each kid.

Ascending the branches to the third tier, she scooted across the scraggly bark on a thick offshoot that hovered over the play area and hunched in the shadows of its canopy. Waiting. Waiting for Brian to present himself as a target of opportunity. It didn’t take long.

Brian was covering the entire field with his trio-selecting each trip he took. He used speed and agility to hit fast and run harder. Currently, he was in retreat from two pursuers he had riled up like a hornet’s nest. Well, this little bee had been turned up and waiting herself. Yet, she was no longer the bee. She was the lioness, and her chosen gazelle was about to be taken down.

As he ducked for cover behind a barricade of boxes, he cowered behind, looking out with his back to her. She took one blue bomb and gave her best war cry as she propelled it from her hands and down into his head.

She laughed with glee as he stood there, rocked and disoriented as to the origin of the assault. She screamed in primal fury as the other two were already in route and hit him in the face and chest-one, two-as he turned in her direction.

The whistle blew. Game time was over.

She had won. Brian could only glower his defeat as she climbed down and celebrated her offence with a couple of others who saw and enjoyed her ingenuity.
