**“Emerging From the Fog” by Martin Vicario**

I think about the title, “Emerging from the Fog,” and it reminds me of a literature class I took back in college. We were considering styles of writing and words like deference, defamiliarization, and deconstruction. It didn’t make sense to me at first, but as the instructor elaborated on the subject and the innovation to the art of writing it started to come together. I can compare it to some genre of music that at first isn’t considered to be music; yet the more one pays attention to it and tries to relate with the musician, the colors become more clear. There was a time that Rock n Roll wasn’t considered sophisticated, yet today Rock n Roll has been the influence or the gateway to New Wave music.

Emerging from the Fog also reminds me of coming to one’s senses after a break up between friends or spouses. At first, there is confusion, i.e., “what the heck is going on?” But as time moves forward the situation becomes clear (this is the meaning of defamiliarization). Anyone who has experienced divorce or great loss can relate to the loss of equilibrium. But then with time things become clear.

Emerging from the Fog reminds me of one time back in the service. Young, footloose, and thinking we were clever. We told our girlfriends we were going out to the game, but actually we were heading to the club. Wouldn’t you know it, as the crowd got thinner and the music started to slow down it became clear that we had been discovered by one of our girlfriend’s friends. A few years later something similar occurred. As the story usually begins, one day after work, and leaving the work site, our wives had gathered together at one of our homes to prepare a dinner for us guys. The ladies had put a lot of work into it. However, on the way home we passed by a Hamburger Hut and it didn’t take much to convince us that we needed to make an emergency stop. You know, greasy, melty, cheesy hamburger with a load of fries calling each of us by name. I don’t know how the ladies knew, but the phone rang. It was Paul’s wife, and by the look on his face, I knew we had been busted! It turns out that one of our wives’ friends noticed our work truck in the parking lot. So much for being on the other side of town.

And then there’s the weather… on a rainy night, and when you least expect it there’s a sharp curve you didn’t see coming until it was too later. A damaged car, hurt pride, and expenses. I have never met anyone that likes to experience misfortune. I like playing it safe, but sometimes you don’t see “it” coming until you are emerging from the fog. I suspect it can also work the other way, too. I don’t see it now, but I could win the lottery or save another person’s life. Eventually my pride healed. I still play it safe. But I have learned that where there is fog, the need for clarity is even greater.
