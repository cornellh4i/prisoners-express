**Clothes by Anthony Kenley**

I now know why all these guys here want to work in the garment factory. I didn’t realize that is where Gucci and Prada outsource their tailoring to. Well, maybe it’s only their prison uniform division. You may laugh, but you can tell these men are wearing designer clothes because of how they act and react while wearing prison uniforms. They won’t even admit they’re state-issued clothes. “These are my whites.” Yeah, they’re $3000 dollar Gucci and Prada whites. Okay!

A man sat beside me on a bench and his “whites” pant leg brushed my old, normal, stained, state-issued uniform. This man moved his leg away and then brushed off his pant leg like my uniform had contaminated his.

You should witness the spectacle in the chow hall. They can’t sit on a seat with a drop of water on it. It may stain their whites. If you walk toward them to put your tray away they cower like idiots. “Oh my gosh you’re coming toward me with a dirty tray.” It’s like you’re a leper. “Unclean, unclean!”

Something hilarious to me is when they’re walking in the rain between buildings. The person behind them is unintentionally slinging mud water all up and down the backs of their legs because their shoes are slinging water around. Their pants end up looking like an appaloosa horse.

These men are issued clean, yet stained, clothes at times. They will then pay someone to illegally bleach their clothes and wash them in a toilet. They pay to have clothes washed in a toilet, then wear them around like they’re designer duds. Only men on a 2500 man unit. Who are they trying to impress? Why?

These people put on a front through clothes. They’re pretending TDCJ dresses us in pristine clothes. They’re pretending we live in a non-work environment (actually, half of them do) so all our clothes are white. They flaunt like they’re special because “Iook, I’m faking it with my whites!” Their version of prison clothes lets them pretend they’re a step up from the dregs of prison society. We’re all equal to the law here. They dress us alike for a reason. We’re all prisoners and no one is special.

People here treat the clothes like they are stolen. They certainly don’t act like the clothes are theirs. A short man will get issued long pants. He’ll cut off the extra length with a razor. Now when he turns them in, they only fit him and are ragged. People will cut hoods from the jackets so they can make do-rags. Don’t worry about someone using this jacket to keep warm. I gots to have my hair looking good. Again, for who?

The population barely changes here day-to-day. So, the same number of people live here and use clothes we trade dirty for clean five days a week. Yet, the bath house is daily running out of clothes. This isn’t rocket science. People horde clothes like they’re valuable. Then necessities has to come shake down the living area to get the state issued clothes back.

These people put on the front like they’re someone, because they have their version of designer clothes. In this environment clothes don’t make the man, no matter how hard they pretend.
