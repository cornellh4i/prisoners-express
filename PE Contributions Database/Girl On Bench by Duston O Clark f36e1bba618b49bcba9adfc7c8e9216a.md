"Girl On Bench" by Duston O. Clark

There she was, on the park bench just as the old man said she would be. She had a book laid out. Maybe she was getting some extra studying in between classes. Whatever. He hated colleges. Universities were filled with nothing but a bunch of self-important stuck up kids wanting to either save the world or make the world.

Real lesson in the Real World Jenny - this shit ain’t fair, sometimes the cute guys are the bad guys and sometimes the bad guys win.. and 20 G’s could get ya all kind of dead.

The man ran as people began to break into a panic, throwing themselves every which way. He blended in with them. Looking just like them on the outside, but nothing like them on the inside. With $100 clothes, it was easy to hide the ugly...
