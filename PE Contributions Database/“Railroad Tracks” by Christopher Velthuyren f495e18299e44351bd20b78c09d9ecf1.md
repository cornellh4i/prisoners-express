**“Railroad Tracks” by Christopher Velthuyren**

Down the fog-enshrouded railroad tracks I watched the train toot-toot its “horn” as it faded away. I reminisced about the time as a teenager when me, my mother, and father rode the train from Pennsylvania to Albany, New York to visit my aunt Christina. It took us only 2 hours and I saw some of the nicest part of the eastern United States, and probably will (never) see any as nice, or just as green; even though a lot was slightly foggy like this month’s fogged picture, it was still beautiful to me, and made me nostalgic just looking at this months pictured theme. I loved it.
