**“When life gives you” by J.Q Chic**

When life gives you a king make yourself his queen. I’m not sure you understand so let me explain what I mean. In terms of chess the king is most essential and though the queen is gentle she watches over their troops in combat while she devises her very own attack. She’ll do whatever it takes to protect her partner even sacrificing her life, by giving herself to their attacker. Though she’s the most powerful she’s willing to die for love, a mediocre emotion that can change your world. So I guess my saying should be when life gives you true love make sure you never set it free.
