**“Thwarted” Efren Hawkins #688014**

Ignorance has thwarted me for a major part of my life. It persuaded me into thinking I was enjoying life, but all I was having were momentary pleasures. It’s like writing a wonderful story without an ending. The readers are wondering what happened. That’s why today I’m making my ending by seeking knowledge and help to put my puzzle together. Yeah, my life is a puzzle and some pieces I struggled to put together.

My life was hindered for a while, because I rejected a number of things. It’s funny to me now, but I one thought I wouldn’t live to be twenty-one. I am forty-five (smile), and trying to open the heart of the people around me to stop being frustrated on small matters, because you are bigger than that.

I’m sharing this, because it happened just last night. This gentleman once used to gangbang. He retired a few months back, but they still kept him in their grip. They oppressed and bullied him. He took all this because he chose his lifestyle in his youth. Recently he chose a religion to become a better person and gain an understanding of the truth! The gang member found out and tried to thwart him from seeking help from a higher power. So, last night they jumped on him out of the worship of a man, I say a man, because if you follow all his rules, that’s who you worship. This thwarts a lot of us from enjoying and understanding life. Let’s get off this course of life, that is destined to ruin us. We can achieve true success and establish a life filled with goodness, as we gain an understanding of ourselves. “Action is but by intention and every man shall have but that which he intended.” Let’s wake up and open our eyes and see that everyone has their ups and downs, but open your heart and mind and seek understanding. No one knows everything, but it’s so good to know something!!!
