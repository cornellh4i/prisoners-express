**Almost by Edward L Finley**

Almost, my oppressors almost transformed me into the wolf that resides within my lower nature.

A vicious, raging, blood-thirsty wolf, is what they tried to change me into.

Limited to nine steps in an isolated box, treated worse than an animal.

Caged!

Fed worse than an animal.

Aromas of bodily functions permeating throughout the unit vents.

Cuffed and walked like dogs with a leash --- pure torment.

Placed in a backyard kennel, just to receive fresh air, this becomes habitual.

Twenty-six steps in a circular motion within four corners, almost like a dance ritual.

Almost, they transformed me.

Almost, I almost gave life to a godless heathen, a misnomer placed upon me.

Instead, I reverted inward to my teachings of humility.

I refuse to allow these dictators dictate when, what, and how I feel.

Almost, I almost forgot the agreement I made with the creator, this was part of the deal.

This, I chose to experience, and on this journey I teach spirituality to those who are ill.

Twenty-three and a quarter hours without nutrients from the sun from which my body feeds.

One hour and sometimes less, my body doesn’t receive what it needs.

Bang, Bang, Bang, sounds of hate and harassment from the guards every fifteen to thirty minutes at the door.

Subjected to a psychiatric assault, almost inciting an uproar.

Temporarily trapped in Boraga, Michigan, in administrative segregation, Custody Level five.

Wasn’t supposed to be here in the first place, however, corruption, war and mistreatment of the people who built this country is how this country thrives.

I’ve learned that the Creator protects its children, and love is a force much greater than fear.

One must Love thy neighbor.

Almost, I almost allowed my oppressors to transform me into the wolf that resides within my lower nature.

ALMOST.
