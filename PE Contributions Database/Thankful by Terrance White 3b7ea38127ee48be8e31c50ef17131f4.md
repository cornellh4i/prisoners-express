**“Thankful” by Terrance White**

I’m thankful to be alive and well

I’m thankful for my family

I’m thankful to have my needs met

I’m thankful to be in good health

I’m thankful for friends

I’m thankful for a job

I’m thankful for all that I have

Every morning when I wake, I thank the Lord for opening my eyes and giving me a new day to enjoy. I’m thankful for being able to go outside to get fresh air and enjoy other people’s company, exercise, and occasionally play a few games of chess. I believe everyone should be thankful for the little things in life and take nothing for granted.
