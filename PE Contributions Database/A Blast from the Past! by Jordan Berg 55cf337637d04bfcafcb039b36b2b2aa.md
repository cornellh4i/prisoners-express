**A Blast from the Past! by Jordan Berg**

We are at War! A predator is lurking. When will it strike? What’s the damage gonna be?

You may be thinking I would be talking about our 20 year engagement in the Middle East. But you would be wrong.

This predator is silent and its reach is indiscriminate and there currently is no cure for it. Things will get worse before they get better. You might have guessed already that I’m writing about COVID-19, AKA Coronavirus.

History is filled with Pandemics. From the Creation of the Universe, however you may believe that happened, the World’s seen its fair share.

Plague’s, Flu’s, Small Pox, Ebola, Coronavirus etc. Together they have killed 100s of millions, maybe billions. Those affected have something in common- Resilience.

You can knock people down, destroy homes and families, yet somehow people always survive.

But they don’t just survive, they thrive on an unbefore known strength they didn’t know they possessed. It’s instinctive.

Sure it’s gonna be difficult, especially when in our lifetime we have NEVER experienced anything like this, that requires us to take unprecedented steps to combat the spread.

We don’t know what tomorrow will bring, but what we do know is that those who are struggling will get help.

People do amazing things when we hurt. Neighbors will help neighbors again. Long lost friends will check in. Food will be delivered. People taken care of.

The most common thing said is “We will get through this”. We will. There’s no doubt.

Humans are remarkably resilient. It takes all sorts to pull through these challenging times. We must never forget those who succumbed to this unseen predator.

Nor can we forget the brave men and women who sacrificed everything in the fact of danger to protect the rest of us. The world is lucky to have Nurses, Doctors, EMS, Police, Truck Drivers, Cashiers, Store Stockers, and many others who continue despite the dangers to themselves and family.

Rebuilding will take time. It will not be easy. Being Resilient is part of our true inner nature. So is helping each other.

This pandemic has shown us all that love shows no boundaries. As Ellen says, “Be kind to one another”
