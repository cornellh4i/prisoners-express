**“When Life Gives You Eggs Make Egg Salad”** by Thomas Shane Matherly

I have been in the Federal Bureau of Prisons for close to twenty years now. I came into the system when I was 24 years old in January 2001. It has been a tough time spending almost half my life being locked up. With the exception of nine months being free, I have been locked up continuously for almost twenty years.

One of the biggest “eggs” that life has given me was when Congress passed and the President signed into law the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. This law designed to protect children was passed rather quickly in about a three month period, maybe a little longer. The big issue this law created was the ability for the federal government to civilly commit any federal prisoner in BOP custody they thought was sexually dangerous. Most people in Congress today do not know what this law is or how it works. However, I have made the best of this situation.

The first “egg” given to me by life after the enactment of the Adam Walsh Act, was not being released to go home on my release date. All prisoners who have release dates know the importance and significance of this date and how exciting it is when the time gets closer. For me, this turned into a dark day. I had no idea that I would not be going home. It wasn’t until I was called to R&D that I found out that I was going to be transferred back to the compound where I was previously serving time, to await a civil commitment hearing to see if the government could prove whether I was sexually dangerous or not. The saddest part of this was that my mother was waiting in the parking lot of the federal prison to take me home. The prison staff paraded me and a couple of other people out to the bus and all I could do was shrug my shoulders to my mom because I did not know what exactly was going on. No one bothered to tell my mom anything about the situation even though she asked the prison staff.

The next “egg” that was given to me was being civilly committed by the court. Even though I have never been convicted of any hands-on sexual offenses, I was still deemed to be sexually dangerous. Since then, I have been incarcerated in the same federal prison for this period of civil commitment as I was when I was serving a criminal sentence.

The good news is that I have been able to take these “eggs” and turn them into something beneficial. First off, I completed the Blackstone Career Institute Paralegal/Legal Assistant Program and received my certificate for that program. Second, I completed my Doctorate Degrees in Biblical Studies and Theology from Promise Ministry, Inc. Third, I am enrolled and currently studying for my Bachelors Degree in Christian Counseling from the International Christian College & Seminary. All of these programs I have paid for myself by continuing to work in prison.

For those of you who are in prison, take every opportunity to educate yourself. If you haven’t received your GED, work hard to get it. Take all the college, A.C.E courses you can possibly take and prepare yourself for the street. In addition, try to maintain employment while in prison. In my almost twenty years of prison time, I have maintained constant employment no matter what department it was with. This will allow you to stay busy and keep out of trouble to the best of your ability.

For those of you on the street, no matter what life deals you, keep on pushing through. If you lose your job, beat the streets and find another one. Go back to school and change your career if you have to find a new job. Above all, never give up.

No matter what life deals us, we can always take the bad and turn it into something good and positive.
