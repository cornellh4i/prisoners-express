**Challenges by Cesar Hernandez**

While justice is the flooding of light into dark places in the world, healing is the flooding of light into dark places in the heart. Throughout history, far worse violations than our broken friendships have required those disfigured with loss to heal and move on with no acknowledgement from their violators. So just as visible and not, that fall to each of us, we’re left with the confusion and pain of making sense of our hurt and those who hurt us, with or without their admission or amends.

Those who cause grief don’t get to say when the grieving is over. Those who cause hurt don’t get to say what’s too emotional. Those who place intelligence over kindness don’t get to be held when suddenly lonely. Those who break their word have to live with a broken tongue. As those who deceive have to live with double vision. Yes, those who take when no one is looking can never trust that the things they hold dear are where they left them. This is the fate of those in between; not whole or free.

It is possible to own our mistakes and still be kind, standing firm means being honest about who we are, mistakes and all, without retreating from the world.

It’s hard to see someone you love, someone you’ve been there for turn indifferent and cruel. Hard to know what to do with this. Difficult not to drown in our versions of what happened. Challenging to hold all things as true.

We’re challenged not to run from the hurt and not to succumb to it. To keep our heart open and take in just enough of the hurt and betrayal so we can build an immunity to the infections of experience when they come our way.
