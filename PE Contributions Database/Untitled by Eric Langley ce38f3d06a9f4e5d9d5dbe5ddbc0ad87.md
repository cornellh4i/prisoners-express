These scarred rocky faces! The clouds that never move, never change. Trees--real actual trees! I think of a song I once heard, “Colorado Rocky Mountain high…” the old croonster sang. The vast, open terrain is music to my eyes. I wake up everyday to stare at this valley and pine to hear my voice echo through it and to breathe air that isn’t recycled by some machine. I might dip my toes in the freezing stream made by the runoff from the snow cap. This is part of my self-prescribed therapy. Everyday, when I wake inside this metal coffin, I get lost in the image. This image is also recycled out of some magazine I found. Within it, however, I find my sanity. I find freedom, a word I once thought to be pure fiction. My eyes open, crusty from sleep, and I find my peace taped to the metal a few feet from my face.

“One day,” I sigh over the snores of my bunk mate. I slide my feet into my shoes, and I’m off to start my day through the metal doorway of where I sleep. Something weighs heavily on me today. Not sure what it is, but I’m feeling a little extra claustrophobic, and so I take the long way to work.

Ah, a window! An expansive openness even more impressive than my mountains. Alas, even more deadly! The key here, once again, is imagination. Wide open space feels…

“Hey, snap out of it! You’ll be late!” Clark slaps me on the back, giving me a start. He keeps walking, and looking at my time piece, I realize he’s right, and I follow at a distance.

* The above took place not in 2016 but in 2416. The narrator is not in prison, although we can all relate to be sure. Violence and hate made Earth a wasteland from nuclear winter which forced the human race to live in the orbits. As all hell broke loose, the only ones to survive were the ones who saw the writing on the wall and evacuated in space vessels. Over two generations, they were able to link their vessels in a makeshift space station.

Now imagine that prison life was all life. No wide open spaces. No trees or grass. Terrorism, both foreign and domestic. Violence because someone believes in a different “sky person” than you. Hell, violence for entertainment or even for the sake of violence. Violence because someone has a different colored sin or loves someone of the same sex.

Is this future really far-fetched? “Be kind to one another,” Ellen Degeneres said.
