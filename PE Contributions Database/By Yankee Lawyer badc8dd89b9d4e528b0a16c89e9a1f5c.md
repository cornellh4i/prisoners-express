**By Yankee Lawyer**

When I came to North Carolina to protect some clients in trouble, Spring was a difficult time. The spores and pollen were different from those in Massachusetts. I developed severe bronchitis as foreign plants took root in my nose. It took my body five years to develop adequate defenses.

That is not what we mean when we talk about “spring fever”.

Spring fever is an emotional condition that affects people as the nights shorten and the days grow longer and warmer. It’s a form of SAD (seasonal affectiveness disorder) characterized by languor, restlessness, and impulsiveness, seemingly irrational behavior. Many women become December brides because of irresponsible behavior by springtime.
