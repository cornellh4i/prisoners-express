**Mother and Son by Cesar Hernandez**

My friend Jessica switches jobs and moves across town. She worries about her very shy son, Luke. Making friends does not come easy for him.

As the new school year approaches, Luke is worried he doesn’t have any friends at his new school. Jessica sits him down and tells him that she’s shy herself. She tells him she has to constantly work hard at making friends. He doesn’t believe her since she’s so outgoing and has lots of friends. She tells Luke she has to push herself to be outgoing.

She tells Luke to find a boy that is by himself. Walk up to him and introduce himself and tell him who his teacher is.

On the first day of school Jessica walks him to school two blocks away. She gives him a big hug at the gate and tells him he’ll make lots of new friends.

Jessica hides behind a tree. She sees Luke hesitate a moment. He walks up to a boy standing by himself and talks to him for a moment. The two boys walk inside the building and Jessica sheds a few tears of joy.
