**Fade to Black: A Life Gone too Soon by Marvin Jones Sr.**

Hello!!! Can anyone hear me? Can you see me? Please, someone, talk to me! Oh God, I’m scared. Something isn’t right, and I can’t wake up, it feels like I’m drowning … where is my family, my Dad? Oh wait, I can see my friends standing over my body, wait, I can see my own body on the floor? What is going on here, why are they slapping my face, and why can’t I feel it? Please, just rush me to the hospital - they will know what to do!

Okay, good - I see Joe and Dave lifting me up and rushing me to the car, please don’t let Dave drive, he is still high from his last shot.

Wow, you guys are just going to throw me in the back of the car with no care at all? That’s alright, just get me to the ER. Wait, the hospital is in the other direction! Where are you taking me?

Why are we stopping at this abandoned building? Get your hands out of my pockets, put my cell phone and money back, I’m going to need those.

Guys?! What are you doing? Don’t leave me on these steps like I’m a piece of trash, come back, come back, don’t leave me here!

Oh my God, what have I done?Why is the darkness creeping up on me? Mom, Daddy, help me, I’m sorry!! Please forgive your baby girl!
