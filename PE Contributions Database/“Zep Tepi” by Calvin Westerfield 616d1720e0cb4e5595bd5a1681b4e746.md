**“Zep Tepi” by Calvin Westerfield**

****Long ago, the ancient people of Ta-Merry, now Egypt, had an intricate mystery system developed by the priest-scientist of their day. Within this system, they referred to the beginning as Zep Tepi which translates to “The First Time.” This phrase, like many other ideologies of theirs, is rooted in a precise astronomical reality. Zep Tepi can be calculated astronomically to the twelfth millennium B.C. at the first appearance of the star Sirius, found in the constellation of Orion’s Belt and at the latitude of the great city of Memphis (Ineb Hedj). This highly advanced civilization set the trend for all to follow for how to utilize the stars and heavens to record time, navigate the land and oceans, and build magnificent structures of stone.

This great history crosses my mind tonight as I sit wrapped in an old wool blanket on a diaphanous mat, cold and lonely. In my single cell, right above the slab of concrete that is my bad, there is a window. Tonight it is my portal to the endless sky that allows me to ponder over its beauty that, like so many other things, seems so distant. The splendor of the full moon illuminates my thoughts as the stars dance to a silent tune. I am both captivated and despair, enjoying the scene through incarcerated eyes.

My makeshift calendar reads the 15th of January 2017, and it’s well past 12 a.m., making this a day I’ve anticipated for many years. This day compels me to reflect on all the dead days that have passed, 4,019 to be exact. Throughout this expanse of loss, I’ve paused to gaze out of many barred windows such as this one to try and appreciate the fullness of time. The continuity of events promises relief to my suffering.

Stars are said to harbor secrets that have never been uttered. Unabridged truth is found up there where probing minds search for sustaining strength in preparation for all the dead days ahead--for wanting answers but failing to formulate reasonable questions in fear of an honest reply. Funny how the eyes observe all this without ever noticing themselves, lost in the simplicity of life.

Today marks the first time the remainder of my prison sentence reaches the single digits. Hardly seems like a momentous occasion, but for me, it is a tiny light at the end of a long tunnel. It’s a realization of the potential of life beyond these restricted boundaries. Only an enervated convict can find optimism in the promise of nine years of prison time left to “serve.” However, as weary as I may be, this day gives me a renewed hope for the night I am able to sit under this celestial miracle as a free man.
