Grandparents by Brad Perkins

I never met my grandfather on my mother’s side. He died when she was just a girl of 10. She often told me that she was the apple of her father’s eye and that things were devastatingly different after he was gone, much for the worse.

He flew in bombers during WWII over Europe and was shot down over Italy. He ended up being a POW after being caught by the Axis powers. He was wounded when his plane got shot down. He died of related complications in 1958.

My grandfather on my father’s side was born in 1894. The family he had with my father’s mother was his second family - his first marriage ended up in a (then scandalous) divorce.

He was a free thinker with no religion and a farmer who toiled with his hands his whole life. By all accounts he was a great guy, he died when I was still a toddler.

My mother’s mother was another elusive figure in my life, she was estranged from my mother until her death early in my childhood.

From what I gather, she was a tragic figure who was never quite right after she lost her husband and had to raise nine kids on her own, back when the social programs that the poor can rely on nowadays were not around.

My father’s mother was the one out of the four that I could claim to have known, as she lived until I was in my late teens. I visited her on occasion during my youth. She was a strange woman who was scarred after losing her oldest daughter in a high school car wreck and was never the same afterwards. My memories of her are mostly of an old woman sitting in a chair mumbling snippets of her television program back at the screen with a distinctive “old person” smell prevalent throughout the house.

Now my parents do the best they can to be grandparents with no real example to follow. They do the best they can and I love them for it.
