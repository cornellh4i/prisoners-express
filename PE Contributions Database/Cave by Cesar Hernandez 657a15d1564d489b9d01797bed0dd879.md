**Cave by Cesar Hernandez**

When I was about ten years old my dad took us to Natural Bridge Caverns. It’s just outside the city, so it was not too far of a drive. We arrived and I didn’t see the cave. I was expecting to see a huge entrance. He bought tickets and our group was about twenty five people. The entrance looked a little small.

The guide unlocked the gate. She went to relock it and a woman began to panic. She was NOT getting locked in. She said she did not want to be on the tour after all. The rest of our group proceeded forward. The cave was interesting. There were both tight and wide open spaces and there were all kinds of rocks and mineral formations.

We arrived at a point where the guide told us she was going to turn off the lights. She unlocked the box for the lights, and she turned off the lights and all kinds of rocks and minerals seemed to glow. It was still so dark you couldn’t see your own hand, but you could see glowing rocks in the distance.

We went during high water season, so we couldn’t see the entire cave. We got to a point and she told us we couldn’t go further. She pointed to a bridge that was almost underwater. The water table was too high during this part of the year.

We went back and bought stuff in the gift shop. I got a medium sized pouch of colorful pebbles.
