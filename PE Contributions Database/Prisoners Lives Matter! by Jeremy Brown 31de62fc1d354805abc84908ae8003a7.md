**Prisoners Lives Matter! by Jeremy Brown**

I’m sitting in a cell that floods when it rains. Prisoners matter.

I’m living in a building that should have been condemned 15 years ago. Prisoners don’t matter.

I’m eating food filled with starches, fluff, sodium, and TVP meat. Prisoners matter.

I’m surrounded by stupid, ignorant, uneducated ganged out idiots who kill each other over a soup made in India, a digital TV channel emitting particles and waves, who cut and slice each other for a reputation of evil to see who can be the most dangerous, ll for a mental reward that exists in the neural synapses and dendrite connections.

I’m surrounded by people who’s reptilian brains have overridden their compassionate original nature. Prisoner’s lives don’t matter.

The good food that we are supposed to be getting is hoarded and stolen by kitchen workers because the state of Florida does not by its in-slaves. I may be ‘in here’ but I refuse to mate, be there bloody mate or be checked and mated with their cursed logic on the Prison chess board. Prisoners' lives matter. Therefore we can now deconstruct the name inmate and enslave and come back to our origin which is just human. Prisoners do matter, but only to loved ones, friends and a small circle of individuals who actually care on the streets. Our lives to 90% of the employees and staff and administrators of the system only matter as much as we can bring them for profit and inprograms.

Yet without us, these small ass, little Godforsaken inbred towns, would be nearly nonexistent and extremely poor. So prisoner’s lives matter! Woohoo! Eh I need a drink...
