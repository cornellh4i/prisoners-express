**“The Fox and the Goose” by D.W. Johnson**

One early summer day, two unlikely friends were out enjoying the warm weather. They went swimming in the creek, they frolicked in the wood, and they chased butterflies through the wildflowers newly grown in the pasture. Exhausted, they stopped to rest in the cool shade of a willow tree down by the creek.

“What a beautiful day,” said the Goose. “Thank you for bringing me out here.”

“No problem,” replied the Fox. “I thought you might enjoy it.”

“I’m sorry you had to push me all the way out here in that buggy,” said the Goose. “My leg hasn’t been the same since I got attacked by that raccoon.”

“It’s ok Goose, it’s nice to get you away from the farm for a while,” said the Fox. They sat together in silence for a few moments enjoying the warmth from the rays of the sun filtering through the leaves.Then, breaking the quiet, the Goose remarked, “Those grubs we found earlier were delicious.”

“Yes they were,” replied the Fox.

“And those flowers, aren’t they beautiful?” asked the Goose.

“Yes they are,” replied the Fox.

“We should do this again sometime,” stated the Goose. The Fox, remaining silent, stood and stretched.

“Hey Fox, remember that time you saved me from that raccoon?”

“Yeah, I remember,” answered the Fox with a grin. Suddenly, the Fox pounced upon the Goose biting and tearing at him with all the savagery expected of a wild fox. Laying there in his final moments as the Fox ripped out his entrails, the Goose cried, “Why?”

The Fox looked up, his muzzle covered in gore. He answered simply,

“Because, you silly Goose, I’m a fox.”
