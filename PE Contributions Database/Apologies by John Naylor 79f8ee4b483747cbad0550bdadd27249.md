**“Apologies” by John Naylor**

I’m thinking of the silver chair song “Year 2000”. That was a good song. “We are the youth we’ll take your fascism away we are the youth apologize for another day we are the youth and politicians are so sure we are the youth and we are knocking on death's door.” Though sad as it is, as a race we feel a need to apologize for anything constantly the song had some heartfelt lyrics.I think as children we’re encouraged to feign sympathy or remorse to be socially acceptable. Because it’s unkind to be brutally honest. So it seems our role models would prefer u to be facetious. As I grew I felt it was dishonest and even somewhat offensive. Tell me how you really feel and I may flip out, sure. It is best to just keep some things to yourself. No point in picking a scab. The doctor told us not to. Literal or figurative it’s probably still not a great idea.

Some say it’s hard. Well maybe, maybe wearing chains into visitation or courtrooms is hard. I’ve had to do both and can tell you I don’t recommend doing anything else if you can avoid it. Sometimes the law will up and snatch you. At least 10 percent of you reading this are innocent by the statistics. You folks don’t have to apologize but you do have to stop trying to what if and relive the past. Trying to comfort your loved ones and build another up is still the Christian thing to do. There’s that word… Christian. It may be monotheistic but it’s the only belief based on grace and mercy. As a military chaplain once said, “Tell me about the God you don’t believe in. I probably don’t believe in him either.” Despite the manipulations of man you only have to apologize with God and repent once for a lifetime of mistakes. Repentance means a change of mind, a change of direction. If you don’t want religion, rest assured. I don’t either. Relationships are different. If we’re not ready to apologize to others he can still repent. In the grand scheme of things, it’s way more important than lip service. If you do apologize to way more important than lip service. If you do apologize to someone, mean it in your heart. Never think people aren’t evil enough to claim it’s out of fear when it’s not. Then again maybe it was for them at some point. Be wise but not in your eyes.
