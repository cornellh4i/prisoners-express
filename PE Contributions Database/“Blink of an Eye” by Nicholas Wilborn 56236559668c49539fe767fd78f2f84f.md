**“Blink of an Eye” by Nicholas Wilborn**

In the blink of an eye, time passes before your eyes. Your hair starts to thin, patches of gray sprout on your face, on your head. Those aches and pains that were once nuisances become full blown problems and debilitating illnesses. You’re not as agile as you once were, not as strong. Injuries linger. What once took a few days or weeks to recover from are now months, and sometimes years from full recovery. You’re not as sure footed and agile as before. ANd it all happens in the blink of an eye.

When you’re incarcerated, kids you left behind as babies are now grown with their own kids. When months pass between visits, the effects of aging are much more prevalent. In the blink of an eye, even those you’ve loved and known your whole life are gone, just like that.

But one thing that never seems to change, that’s always with you when you lay your head to rest at night is the hurt you’ve caused, the pain you’ve dealt, and the dreams you turned to nightmares. And it all occured in the blink of an eye.
