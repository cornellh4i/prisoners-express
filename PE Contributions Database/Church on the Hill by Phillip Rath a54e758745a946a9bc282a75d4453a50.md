**Church on the Hill by Phillip Rath**

I’m reminded of the standoff between the FBI and members of the American Indian Movement (A.I.M.) at Wounded Knee, South Dakota in 1972.

Unbeknownst to most Americans, this was not the most noteworthy event at Wounded Knee. Like most events that put Americans in a bad light, Wounded Knee has been erased from the collective memory of America, along with our passive role going into WWII, the My Lai massacre and many other shameful events.

American Indians practicing their religion were machine gunned (Gatling gun) by American troops, indiscriminately killing unarmed men, women and children. That is a truth of our history we should never forget.

American wanted to play neutral in the years leading up to WWII. Hitler used this to perpetuate his atrocities against Jews and others he considered undesirable. Do we have blood on our hands from our failure to act?

In Vietnam a lieutenant went berserk along with his men and starting a rampage of killing, raping and pillaging of a small village. Thanks to a few brave individuals this atrocity came to light, but America had forgotten!

Realizing our faults and weaknesses is not traitorous or disloyal, it is honest! Look back through the history of America, realize the truth and gain strength from it and resolve to never play a passive role in the atrocities our society perpetuates!

While you’re at it, look inside yourself and your history…!
