**“Teeth” by Tom Farlow**

Jonathan clicked off the call and flagged a passing waitress. “We have a third party coming. Can we get moved to a table that will accommodate us, please Miss?”

“I’ll take a look for you, sir.”

Denton looked at him from across the table.

“So, what’s up?”

“Jenn’s hysterical about something. She was going on about the glass being gone, people in the house with masks. We’ll get her to calm down, breathe, and focus when she gets here.”

“I’m sorry sir,” the waitress said, returning, “We are unable to move your party. We will do our best to make her comfortable when she arrives.”

“Oh-kay,” came the surprised and affronted reply as she strode off. He and Denton looked about. Several tables for four or more stood vacant at *Marcelle’s*. Most of the tables near the stage were occupied with patrons dining and drinking until *Peaux Das* took the stage which was being set up.

“Don’t get that one, Dent. There are plenty of places we can move to.”

“Yup.”

“Never seen a table reserved here before.”

“Nope.”

“So why the sudden change in --- She said, ‘her.’ I said ‘third party.’ How did she know it was a female coming?” He began to rise, but a hand appeared on his shoulder, stopping him.

“Remain seated, Jon.”

Denton and Jon looked as if a ghost had walked in, and one might just have. “You’ve got timing, Dave. Your wife’s coming along soon,” said Denton when he noticed Jon was stunned silent.

“We need to discuss that. You boys come out back with me. This here is too crowded.” The two rose, and the group went out a side door into the humid summer air. Frogs croaked from the lake out back. Now and then, there was a swish of water from a gator moving about. Pelicans silhouetted themselves on the crimson sky of a setting southern sun. It would be beautiful if the world wasn’t being rocked right now.

“I tried my best to keep Jenn in the dark. She’s always been safer that way. But, you guys digging into this one has kicked the ant hill. You gotta get her to safety. You two, also. They have names now as well.”

“Who, Dave?” asked an emotional Jon. “You’ve been gone four weeks without a word. What did you expect her to do? Sit and wait?”

“I can’t say who. All I can tell you is back away now to save yourselves. I’ve done all---”

They were suddenly surrounded by ten men with guns. A van pulled up on the lawn, doors slid open, and a couple of the men started to pull out equipment. A short ruddy-looking man came out of the van. “Gentleman, sorry to interrupt. But, we’re on a deadline. Hold them,” he told his men.

Jon and Denton were held down as they were forced to watch Dave be wrapped in head to toe in plastic wrap. Holes were cut out for his eyes and mouth, and weights were tied to his legs with chains.

“Come, gentlemen. We have an opening act to perform.”

There was almost pandemonium as a troupe of men entered the restaurant fully armed. Orders from the little man kept everyone in their seats. Jon and Dent were led to the table where Jenn, a scared look on her face, sat. She almost jumped as Dave was carried in and placed on the stage for all to see, but Dent kept her quiet.

“Ladies and Gentlemen. Tonight is just one act. We call it ‘Lesson.’ A nod from the dwarf and a man threw a match on Dave. He was covered in flames in mere seconds. Then, all hell broke loose.

They had to drag Jenn who was screaming Dave’s name over and over with them as they avoided being trampled from the mob. Outside, the scene was just as bad. A pileup had blocked the parking lot, so they opted to continue with the mass of people running down the street. A few blocks down, they took a side street to separate from the group and to see if they were followed.

At the end of the street was a ravine flowing with a torrent of sewage water. A hand bridge provided a way across, but a five foot split in the ground separated them from using it. Jon noticed an alley to their left.

“Dent, you and Jenn see if there is a way to the bridge. I’ll check this alley.” A nod from each, and then Jon went down the dark walk. He didn’t have to go far. Twenty feet in, it turned left again to end at some business’s backdoor and a dumpster. He retraced his steps to tell the others, but they were not there on his return. He walked to the bridge and noticed the crevice was gone. A rolling mass of grass was between him and the bridge now. As the sod moved, gas bubbles erupted, leaving something white underneath. He picked up a fallen branch and began to prod the ground. He found a seam and flipped over the sod.

Under it was a mass of flesh and bone. Under the grass and in the ground, rows and rows of what looked like miniature shark teeth. A gas bubble burst, moving the top of the mass. Denton’s face looked at him with dead eyes. He dropped the stick and ran.

*What the hell is happening!?!* His thoughts screamed. He ran a few blocks until he was before a housing complex. Picking up a book at the front entrance, he attempted to look like a casual occupant returning to his room. He ducked down one hallway and was halfway through when every door opened, and an intercom announced, “Dinner-time.”

Men in white shirts, pants, and slippers shuffled in the hallway, filed in line, and made their way out.

“I’m in a mental hospital.” He slipped into a room to hide out, but the men in there had not yet left, forcing him out. He tried to go out the rear, but the place was surrounded by police. He was taken around back by a couple of them, cuffed up, and one of them took the butt of his rifle to his head.

Next thing Jon knew, he was looking out some material covering his face and body. He saw he was still at the mental place. He got up and ran. Flee first. Plan when escaped. A few miles down the road, he slipped into an alley to assess his wounds.

He was trussed up in some fabric. He could see out of it and it covered his body. Finding a sharp corner of a brick, he finally cut into a corner into the section covering his hands. He did not find his hands inside. Bones protruded instead.

A long rant of freaking out followed the discovery. Looking at a mirror in the trash, he saw he was all bones in a sack. After a series of debates, he settled on one: Find a Voodoo Man.

He knew of one, down in the Ninth Ward. He had worked on some cases with him. He made it to thut in the dawning hours. He was glad that the night hid him from casual eyes. Jax Dubois thought at first that he was a specter coming for revenge. After proving who he was, Jax worked to undo the spell on him.

Success came only part way. Jon was restored to an adolescent. “At least I am alive,” he said. As a child, he had to find help. He knew of a friend who taught at a local elementary school. Jax dropped him off there.

It was strange to be at a school again and of age for it, too. He strolled the halls looking for his friend’s class. Passing a row of lockers, two young students smiled at him. He smiled back and then stopped. Their teeth were glowing pearly white. They opened their jaws, and he was suddenly filled with the vision of flesh and rows of teeth inside their mouths just like the ground. He fled the school grounds as fast as a kid could go.

As he exited the gates and turned to go right, movement to the left caught his eye. Two forms lumbered towards him. They were covered in a familiar fabric and had chains on them. His feet felt frozen as they continued on towards closer to him. One spoke to him. A final straw.

“Don’t run, Jon. You can’t run. Just give in,” came Jenn’s voice.

Jonathan screamed.
