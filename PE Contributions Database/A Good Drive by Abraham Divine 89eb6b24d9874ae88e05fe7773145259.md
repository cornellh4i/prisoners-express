**A Good Drive by Abraham Divine**

One day, not too long ago, Abraham was driving around in his 1968 Gt. Shelby 500. When he saw two of his best friends hanging out on 5th and main street, Abraham pulled over and parked and got out of his car.

Abraham spoke to both of them, “Hi Jan and Kate!”

“Hi Abraham,” they both said.

“Long time no see,” Abraham said jokingly “What are you two doing today?”

“We are waiting on this old light to change,” they said.

“Where have you two been today?” Abraham asked.

Jan said, “I just came from a job interview”

“For what?” Abraham asked.

“For a county clerk” said Jan.

“Well did you get the job?” Abraham asked.

“Yes indeed!” said Jan.

“Well, what about you, Kate?” Abraham asked.

“I’ve been at band practice for a few hours” said Kate.

“Have you made it to stardom yet?” Abraham asked Kate jokingly.

Kate stated “No, not yet.”

“What about you, Abraham?” they both asked.

“Well I just came from a church meeting. It was mostly about money, but we touched on the subject of taking life for granted.” “

“Wow,” said Kate, “that’s what my new song is about.”

““Well then, in honor of your song, let me take a picture to remember this moment forever,” said Abraham. So Kate stood like a rockstar with her hand on the wall and head held high. Jan started laughing at Kate because of the way Kate was standing, then Abraham took the picture. They they all took a ride in Abraham’s car to go celebrate. So Abraham, Jan, and Kate went to Outback Steak House in Meridian Mississippi to celebrate accordingly. They had a blast just eating, drinking, talking, and cracking jokes. They had so much fun hanging out and being friends, and not taking life for granted. Because that is what life is all about: living for the moment and taking nothing for granted.
