**Untitled by Cesar Hernandez**

There are two ways you can live: you can devote your life to staying in your comfort zone, or you can work on your freedom. You can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.

Let’s take a trip to the zoo. Imagine you’re having a great time, until you see a wolf inside a small cage. This causes you to contemplate what it would be like to live the rest of your life in such tight confinement. The very thought is extremely frightening to you. In reality, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn’t limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness. You are unable to go outside your comfort zone. You are, in essence, locked in confinement.

If you examine this, you will see that you’re willing to stay in this cage because you’re afraid. Your comfort zone is familiar to you; beyond it is the unknown. To fully appreciate this, imagine the most paranoid person you have ever met in your entire life. They’re so scared. Every moment of their life, they think somebody’s trying to hurt them. If you offer them that wolf’s cage, they might accept your offer. They don’t see it as being locked in a cage. They see it as protection from what could harm them. That which looks like a prison to you, looks like safety to them. What if a security service came to your house and bolted down all the doors and barred all the windows? If you happened to be inside at the time, would you panic and want to get out, or would you thank them for helping you feel safe?

Most people have the second reaction when it comes to the limitations of their psyche. They want to stay in there and feel safe. They don’t say, “Get me out of here! I’m locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody’s doing, what I look like, and everything I’ve ever said. I want out.” Instead of wanting out, they try to keep their cage stable. If something is not comfortable, they do whatever they must to protect themselves and get back to a feeling of safety. If you’ve ever done that, it means you love your cage. When the cage of the psyche got rattled, you fixed it so you could be comfortable inside.

When you truly awake spiritually, you realize you are caged. You wake up and realize that you can hardly move in there. You’re constantly hitting the limits of your comfort zone. You see that you’re afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you have to stay on top of everything in order to be okay.

Why? There’s really no reason. You set these limits on yourself. If you don’t stay within them, you get scared, you feel hurt, and you feel threatened. That’s your cage. The wolf knows the limits of his cage when he hits the bars. You know the limits of your cage when the psyche starts to resist. Your bars are the outer boundary of your comfort zone. The minute you come to the edge of your cage, it lets you know in no uncertain terms.
