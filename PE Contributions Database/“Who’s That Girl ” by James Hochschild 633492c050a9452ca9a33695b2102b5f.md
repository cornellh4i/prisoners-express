**“Who’s That Girl?” by James Hochschild**

You look wonderful and intriguing to me,

I wonder who you are.

Are you in mourning with that black veil?

If so, I’m sorry for your loss.

They must have been someone you loved

dearly in order to mourn them.

I wonder who you are.

Are you someone who has to wear a black

veil due to the culture you belong to?

If so, I’m sorry for causing any

embarrassment when you looked away from

me.

Or, it was just coincidence and something

else caught your attention.

I wonder who you are.

Instead of guessing who you are,

I believe I will take the risk

of rejection and introduce myself

to you.

Maybe I’ll get a chance to find out

who you are.
