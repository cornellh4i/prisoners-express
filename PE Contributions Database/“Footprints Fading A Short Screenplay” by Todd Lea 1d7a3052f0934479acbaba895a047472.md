**“Footprints Fading: A Short Screenplay” by Todd Leatherhead**

*FADE IN:*

*INT. QUAINT LIVING ROOM - FAIRLY MORNING*

*SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION…* “October 10, 2020 - New Zion”

… the living room itself is practical and “lived in.” Morning light filters softly in amongst hampers of unfolded clothes, scattered toys and sippy cups.

Sitting on the carpet is a young mother intent upon her newborn baby girl, who is cooing playfully. Although the mother is interacting with the newborn with maternal playfulness and optimism; there is still an atmosphere of weariness and uncertainty.

In the background, the television is too loud, perhaps to drown out reality. It competes with the mother’s words. It is turned into a documentary about geoengineering and technological evolution, with the attendant human and geological suffering of climate change.

A picture hangs on the wall of the famous poem, “footprints.” A treasured memento received from her mother, who used to read it to her as a little girl. The picture has captivated the newborn’s attention. The mother sees an opportunity to introduce the poem, taking her baby’s feet into her hands, but the overly loud documentary casts a gloomy overshadow on the otherwise tender moment.

MOTHER

One day, a man had a dream that he was walking along a beach. As he continued to walk, he noticed behind him footprints in the sand.

NEWBORN

(smirks playfully)

TELEVISION

On some fundamental level, we all know something is wrong with our planet. Geoengineering has upset the natural order of things, and the equilibrium of the earth’s natural processes has been compromised. Brashly intruding upon nature’s domain awakens an aspect of human nature that is disturbing and corrosive. Internally, it reaches deep into the dark recesses of the heart - the corrupt core, which finds purpose in the expedient drive to exalt itself over all things. At the same time, that drive is also derived, externally, from outside the civilized guidelines; it is a primal thrust of archaic domineering...

NEWBORN

(kicks feet playfully in Mother’s hands)

MOTHER

(smiling fondly at Newborn)

… the footprints were telling the story of the man’s life. There were times on his life journey with one set of footprints and other times with two sets of footprints. The man wondered about this…

TELEVISION

… this threat must be met by a moral position foreign to all laws, policies and governing bodies. In other words, if the intent of the entities responsible for geoengineering and technological transhumanism is born from primal instincts, then, humanity is entitled, by virtue of self-preservation to meet the onslaught accordingly, with means that reflect and promote survival, completely removed from social protocols, norms, governing contracts and the like. The free individual must meet the toxic rule, by force of will, with an overwhelming brute force, to achieve inherent self-determination.

MOTHER

(tickling newborn’s feet)

… the man continued to walk along the beach, contemplating his life’s journey and the footprints in the sand. At the end of his life, he encountered Yahshua...

NEWBORN

(cooing; at Yahshua’s name, the newborn becomes intent on Mother)

TELEVISION

… It is inevitable, however, that there will be proponents of geoengineering, its mechanisms, and its underlying transhumanistic philosophy. Techno-evolutionists, who are currently enthralled by the technocratic think tank-oblivious to its real purpose - may, one day, find themselves enslaved to their own technology. Then, destined to rely on scientific development, they become dependent on inventive captors: resigned to an existence of servitude. Professor Michael Hanby, quoting Francis Bacon, states: “There is a final, more ominous sense of technology inaugurated by this philosophical revolution: technology as a kind of fate. If nature is essentially a machine or, in contemporary nomenclature, a system, then the knowledge of nature is essentially geoengineering. The task of science, as Bacon puts it, is ‘generate or superinduce on a given body a new nature or natures.’”

MOTHER

(looking at “Footprints” with resolute hope)

… “You promised me, Lord, that if I followed you, you would walk with me always. But I noticed that during the most trying periods of my life, there was only one set of footprints in the sand. Why, when I needed you the most, have you not been there for me?

TELEVISION

… Hanby is suggesting this technological relationship results in an interminable revolution against the current order, establishing revolution - paradoxically - as a permanent principle and stable institution. The technological order would constitute perpetual flux. Perhaps, then, in light of the perpetual technological revolution, the “necessary evil” debate must occur. That is, the conversation over geoengineering being necessary for survival, in order to remediate the damage already done for the climate. Who dares to stand in defiance against the tide of change?

YAHSHUA

(demonstrating unconditional love and eternal security)

… “The years when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, is when I carried you.”...

… “and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
