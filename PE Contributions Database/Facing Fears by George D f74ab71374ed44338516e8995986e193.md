**by George D.**

****As a young kid, I remember facin’ my fear when my dad got me a horse. I was about 2 years old, and my mom took a picture (I think she still has it--man!). I was scared of the horse, but now I’m alright. Although I never got on a horse, I could be around them.

My other fear was, and still is, height. I don’t like to ride on roller coasters or take things that go real high, like airplanes. Though I’ve never been on one, I don’t wish to be. I’d rather drive or take a bus.

And another fear is bein’ locked up in a dark room. Every time in a movie, I see someone bein’ burned alive or bein’ locked up there. I just can’t stand to watch that.

And goin’ way out there on a boat. I remember going’ with our dad fishin’, and he told us boys to get in the boat so we could catch the fish out there. At first, I thought that’ll be real cool--man! I was so scared I kept begging my dad to please take me back. No, I don’t know how to swim.

But I know with my Lord’s help, He will help me to overcome all my fears ‘cause there’s no fear but love in Jesus. Love conquers fear, and I can do anything through Christ who strengthens me. I will not fear no evil.
