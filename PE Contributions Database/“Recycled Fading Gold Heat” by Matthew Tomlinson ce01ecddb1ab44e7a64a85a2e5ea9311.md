**“Recycled Fading Gold Heat” by Matthew Tomlinson**

**Recapitulation is appropriate. In the old days, at the last of the twentieth century, there weren’t yet so many cellular telephones with cameras. There was, however, amateur (called ham) radio. Cell phones produce breathtaking photos. Ham radio can also produce breathtaking photos, free of charges.

It was 8:30 on a rainy November Monday. Princess was making herself available out on Airline Drive, like any cheap streetwalker. We’d passed northbound going to Kroger. We’d brought her back a cup of coffee with a box of doughnuts. Princess shared light remarks with me. Princess had hit on me to do a date with her, as any streetwalker. The offer had been declined. Princess had reached into her bra for identification. She was Detective Princess Gold of Houston Police.

Princess had gotten no joy. There’d been no solicitation, so she had no grounds to arrest me. Princess had waved a smile to my teddy bear Shotgun, in the back seat. In the old days a cop might have wondered about teddy bears in vehicles. Those stuffed animals were great camouflage for analog cameras. Detective Gold had asked to be driven to shack. She’d known that’s what I called my house. The Shack was at the corner of Thirty-fourth and Pecan, by the railroad tracks, and Detective Gold knew that, too. Princess was knowledgeable.

Princess had fallen to the cop tactics from the old days. She’d known it’s my habit to cruise Airline Drive shopping for cheap prostitutes. Princess had been working a murder case. She’d wanted to determine what gossip the streetwalkers had been spreading. An old ex-convict like me doesn’t snitch, doesn’t work for the law, and doesn’t know anything at all about what anyone else does. That’s how an ex-con lives long enough to become old.

Princess reached into her bra again. “You did ten years in prison. You did time with people who say they got framed on a possession charge.” She tossed a baggie into my lap. “Eight ball. Do you play ball or do you risk a possession charge?”

Now that’s a tough decision!

We crossed West Crosstimbers before Princess realized how much she’d bitten off. She turned to the back seat. My teddy bear sat placidly looking forward. Princess gave me a stern stare.

“I researched you. I went to Cornell University website. They have a program called Prisoner Express. I read all your essays in Prisoner Express. All of them. I especially liked ‘The Two-Five-Five Project’, about radio remote control.”

We rose to top the railroad overpass. The jeep slowed in preparation for the turn. “It’s true.” At the overpass bottom we made the right onto Thirty-Fourth. “In 1975 we built a robot in high school. We used Citizen’s Band radio to control it.”

We rounded the corner onto Pecan, then parked at 104 North Pecan, the end house4. Princess gave my stuffed animal a baleful glare. “It is bugged?”

The baggie she’d thrown into my lap for entrapment was held in the air between our seats. Shotgun saw it. “You didn’t ask that before you planted this on me. Dummy! Come inside. We’ll talk everything over.”

Princess opened her door. “Any more booby traps?”

My door was opened. “Yes! Don’t be a booby any more. Make note of my license plates.”

Detective Gold followed me into The Shack, carrying her sack. “KD5CHN? I knew you’re a ham.” We walked back to the kitchen. My sack flopped on the table. Princess took a plate from the cabinet. “Look, is there some way we could work this out?”

My curt nod acknowledged her. Detective Gold must initiate the transaction herself. Once she broke ice, though, she wasn’t clothed with the authority of the State of Texas. The matter became a routine business deal. Whatever a willing seller would accept and whatever a willing buyer would give constituted a fair price. “Yes. We can work out your entrapment.”

Princess arranged doughnuts on the plate. She started the microwave. “Hot doughnuts. Hot coffee.” Then she sighed. “What will it take?”

“You researched me? You know what I’m all about. We’ll eat our doughnuts. We’ll go in my bedroom.”

“I can’t cheat on my husband!”

“Adultery or prosecution. Your choice.”

The microwave dinged. Yeah, when you draw heat in prison then you gotta fade your own heat.
