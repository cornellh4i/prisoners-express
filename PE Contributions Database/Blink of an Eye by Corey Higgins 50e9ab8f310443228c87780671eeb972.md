**“Blink of an Eye”**

It seems like within a blink of an eye I’ve had to say goodbye to way too many people, I’ve lost my mother, wife, friends, and now most of my family all in a “Blink of an Eye.” Guess you could say blink once times gone by, blink twice and we’re living in lost time.

I sit back in my long term cell, and wonder if I was to look at myself in this steel plate hanging on the wall if I blink, or wink, flutter, and turn about everything would be done? Nope still here with my runes ad books. Now it’s time to see if I blink enough it will hold back the tears, if only I had a few left.

Within a blink of an eye my life went to good to being sent to prison for over ten years an some real dumb shit. Tell you what, one of us tried not to blink cause it's a pain in the ass as it stands “I’ve Been Blinking Too Much”.
