**“Debts” by Jack Simpson**

A lot of people take credits for granted. Over the years I’ve seen on TV how a good credit score will get you all kinds of things, like a car, a home, or whatever your heart’s desire.

After so long in prison one’s credit hit’s rock bottom. Most if all if it was ruined prior to being in prison.

In prison it is best to not too get in debt with these people. Here they don’t ruin your credit, they will take your life for bills unpaid. Thank God I don’t have to ask anyone for anything, I still have family who love me from the street.

It isn’t funny to watch a person get stabbed or robbed because they charge too much for canteen items. Or that they refuse to pay the people they owe.

S.C.D.C. stopped smoking in prison in 2007. I haven’t smoked since. Feel so much better. I know these items are high on the street. When you pay five dollars for one roll-up. Then who is the fool, even if they started to sell them again, I wouldn’t pick them back up.

I feel like a man being debt free. Not like I am a lower person because I owe this other one. It takes a real person to be out of debt and feel the weight off my shoulders.

Staying out of debt clears my mind and I sleep well at night. To build one’s credit up is fine, I prefer cash on the street, a paid in full receipt makes me feel so much better, not like a person who worries on how the bill’s are going to get paid.
