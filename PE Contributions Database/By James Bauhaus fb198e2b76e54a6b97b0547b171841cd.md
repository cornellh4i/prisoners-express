**By James Bauhaus**

I have it. I can tell by what I told the prison bureaucrat a minute ago. I’ve been trying to get two lousy minutes with this ‘crat for the past 7 freaking days. It’s like trespassing a minefield. She hides behind 4 locked doors, each of which have a role assigned to prevent passage. Also, she’s mostly never there. You know how honest people put in 40 hours/week? She only has to show up intermittently, plus, she’s like Shroedinger’s cat: no one can tell if she’s actually in her office until you finally manage to look inside. Wednesday and Friday, don’t even try: she’s not there. On Monday, Tuesday, and Friday, you might get two chances to get lucky: between 8:30am and 9:30, and between 11:30am and 1:30pm

Ordinarily, I avoid these people who can only harm me. This time, other prisoncrats are determined to steal two books that I had paid a vendor to send. These “property” ‘crats have been sitting on them for almost a month. They are swamped with the mountains of stuff that they stole from us during their 40 day-long bi-annual prisonwide cage ransack and theft-a-thon. They stole from me 10 paper clips, 2 plastic bowls, a pen, a pencil sharpener, plastic scissors and ½ a jar of mentholatum. This is only what they admit to stealing from me, on official paper. They give us two choices: send it away, or let them sell it for the guard-party fund. SInce I have too much money left over from my escape, I never let the guards drink up my property. I always send the stuff they steal from me to the coalition for Prisoner's Rights in Santa Fe.

They make it an agony of bureaucratic nonsense to do this. They make me chase the ‘crat for days, trying to get a disbursement slip, trying to make her accept the way I filled it out, trying to get my thumbprint on it from the inkpad that she never has, and trying to make her sign the paper that lets me spend my own money for postage.

This time, I had a slight advantage. It works like this: 3 times/year, the ‘crat has to chase me for my signature. It doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t accomplish anything. It only justifies her salary by qualifying as her job. It lets their prisoncrats pretend that they have something to do with “corrections” (“rehabilitation”) instead of just being the earthly extension of the 9th ring of hell. In 7 days, she dodged two written requests to bring her ink pad to the “big” cage when she came to “service” (attach strings to) the almost-out short-timer inmates. She promised to bring it “next trip” 2 times and didn’t even come back each day. She and her door-blocking cronies wasted so many hours of my time that I was ready to simply give up. Then, they had another no-excuse, unexpected total lockup that interfered with her attempt to lineup and gave her those 50 signatures.
