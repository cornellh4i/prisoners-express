My first job, I started selling drugs. I began working the door, just setting use to everyone, and then I got to work the door and serve. It was a fun learning game; the drug game is just like McDonald’s, but sometimes you work 24 hours a day answering the door. Then I moved to bagging. This was fun, and I had to wear gloves and learn to use a scale and to fill bags. I put 25-50-100 of these bags in a sandwich bag. After I got good at this and took $3 on every $10, I bought an 8 ball, started dropping my own bags. I went out on my own and opened my own spot; a lot of customers followed me because I treated them well. As you learn, you grow in the game and get raises. You look at $3 on every dime and say, “I’ll never do that. That ain’t no money.” Look, 3 for me right, 3 for re-up, and 4 for the person you’re working for. When you’re dropping 50-250 bags a day, that’s money. That was my first job.
