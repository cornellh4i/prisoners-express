Growing up, I always thought of the big city as New York City only. I knew I had to get to the big city one day! All my life I had traveled but never understood what, or if I was there, a big city was. So around the time I turned twenty years old I climbed onto a tractor trailer loaded with furniture headed for The Big Bad City I always craved, New York, New York!

The new job I had consisted of driving a truck out of state, getting sales permits and selling furniture from the furniture capital of the world, High Point, North Carolina. After that first trip out, I was HOOKED on traveling! We would drive to a city, set up to sell, and once the truck was empty, we went home.

This job was cool, but I was always stuck to one area, so I was craving more travel and more excitement. After two years of this job I got involved with a different company who drove furniture out of town but delivered and set it up (being it was already sold). This was definitely a big change. No more soliciting and no more stuck in one area! My new job was it!

In-home delivery was way more exciting. It allowed me to see multiple big cities, people, places, and more areas of these big cities I craved. We would do up to fifteen stops a day all across multiple cities, states, etc. This job has allowed me to see the true meaning of a big city.

I’ve been to the Puerto Rican Day Parade and the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. I’ve been to Boston and partied for St. Patrick’s Day and Cinco De Mayo. I’ve walked Bourbon Street, New Orleans with fish bowls of beer strapped to my neck and hand grenade mix drinks while listening to the best music ever made and seeing some of the best sights! (Wink wink.) Everyday is Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street.

I’ve spent cold-cold snowy days in Detroit, Michigan, a city that seems almost like a third world country. I’ve driven through St. Louis, beside the famous Arch. I’ve been in downtown Chicago in the penthouse suite of a high rise building, setting up a bedroom set, looking out over the city, realizing how small I am to a city so big. I’ve toured the Underground with friends in Atlanta. I’ve seen how everything really is bigger in Texas from Dallas, Houston, to Fort Worth. I could go on for days about the places I’ve been and the things I’ve seen.

I love the outdoors, the country quiet places and the mountains with small towns. But there is no place in the world like the experience of a big city. The sights, smells, food, people, car horns, smog, buildings, police sirens, and the overall feel of the big city is something that draws me in and keeps me mesmerized. The big city is almost the equivalent of the best drug. Once you get a taste, it leaves you feigning for more. I’m addicted to the fast, hustle, bustle, and lifestyle of the big city! Not everyone gets a chance to rip, run, and travel to big cities.

If you’ve never been far from home, I suggest everybody travel at least once to a big city. When I say big city I don’t mean a big town, I mean a Big City - New York, Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago or somewhere. It’s its own beautiful art form. Everybody should see Boston, Massachusetts, and New York City, at least once! It’s amazing! I love these big cities!
