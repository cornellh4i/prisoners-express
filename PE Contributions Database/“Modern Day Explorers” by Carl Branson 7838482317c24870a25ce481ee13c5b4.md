**“Modern Day Explorers” by Carl Branson**

For prisoners, the explorers blazing trails to the snow-capped summit of justice are the competent, indefatigable “jailhouse lawyers.” Like Lewis and Clark who had little, if any, formal training as explorers, these contemporary seekers have obtained their education in the university of hard knocks. Navigating the rough terrain of complex statutes, rules of court, and case law precedent to find where and how to ford rivers of public prejudice, thwart hordes of overzealous prosecutors, and fell the timber of bored, biased judges is as challenging as finding a fast, reliable route to the Orient (think: Christopher Columbus).

In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in *Lewis v. Casey* set Arizona’s prisoner litigants adrift with a rotted paddle. Virtually overnight, Arizona’s law libraries went from the scope of what a large law firm would maintain for its associates to a mere handful of books--the “most valuable” of which are the annotated criminal statutes and the annotated federal habeas corpus provisions. However, since many post-conviction claims challenge an abusively excessive prison sentence on constitutional grounds, the lack of annotated state and federal constitutions leave prison “lawyers” without a reliable compass. Yet, like their colonial forebears, these bold few persist in seeking a pass through the judicial mountains and forests. The alternate route to bypass the local, readily accessible prison law library is accessed via ounty sponsored law libraries or law school libraries. Although burdensome in both time and finances, this detour is proving workable.

In the same way that the westward expansion by our ancestors started incrementally, so too are the victories achieved by Arizona’s “jailhouse lawyers.” This author is unaware of a benchmark precedent being set by an Arizona “jailhouse lawyer,” but the author has achieved a conviction vacated here and a sentence corrected there on a more frequent basis. This demonstrates the level of competence being achieved by these self-educated litigators, particularly when their victories come after attorneys appointed because post-conviction proceedings serve notice of finding no arguable claims for relief. Sooner or later, their efforts will result in an “Oregon Trail” on which others will travel for a new life.
