Apartment 3A Part I

By Marvin Jones

My first morning in my new apartment, in my new neighborhood and I’m awaken by a woman in the next apartment mutilating a classic song. I can tell she is in pain by how she pauses like she’s crying.

- Next door Apt. 3B -

Jasmine is really in her blues this morning, unaware that apartment 3A is no longer unoccupied as she sings, or at least tries to sing, at the top of her lungs… “Sunshine, Blue Skies, please go away… my man has found another… and gone away… with him went my future… my days are filled with gloom… so day after day… I stay locked up in my room… and… I know to you it might sound strange… but I wish it would rain… oh, how I wish that it would rain”.

Her blues stem from her 393 frame, low self-esteem, low morals and the loss of yet another boyfriend. All her life she has been a Big girl, people have ridiculed her for her weight, her family included! Though she is very beautiful, she has been told by haters that she is ugly, been called Ms. Piggy, told she stinks (which is untrue).

She’s never really had a true friend or really known love, everyone has always used her for what they can get and them thrown her away like trash. Seems like life has always give her crap!

- Enters Apt. 3A -

Marcellus, lays in his bed wondering what could of caused this female next door so much pain? He reflects on the last few months of his life that lead him here to Silver Springs, Maryland.

Marcellus comes from a good family of God-fearing Christians, he has known nothing but love. Good-looking, athletically built and well-spoken. He dated women you would consider supermodel material, but they were not wifey material and at the age of 30, he is tired of short-lived romances. After re-dedicating himself to the Lord, he decided change was in order, and God must of agreed with him because he put it on Marcellus’ heart to pack up and move to Silver Springs, MD.

Ever the obedient one, he did not question it, he went to visit his family and told them what God wanted him to do, with his family’s support he found a job and a place to live.

“You know what?” Marcellus says to himself, “Let me go introduce myself to my neighbor.”

- Apt. 3B -

Knock, knock, knock!!

Jasmine has just gotten out of the shower, she goes to the door and looks through the peephole. “Who is this fine brother at my door” she says to herself!

“Who is it?” she says!

“Hello, my name is Marcellus and I’m your new neighbor from 3A” he says to the closed door.

Jasmine not wanting him to see her 393 pound frame says, “I’m not decent, what can I do for you?”

“Oh, I’m sorry. I was just introducing myself. I won’t bother you, you have a blessed day!”

He strolls back to his apartment and thought as he entered “I don’t even know her name”.

Jasmine leans against her door, hating herself for being so insecure… but she knows in her heart he would never want her, so she decided as usual, she’d avoid that fine brother!

3 weeks go by and Marcellus has even seen his neighbor, by the time he gets in from work, she’s already in her apartment, locked in like someone on house arrest! He speaks to his sister about it and she advises him to slip a getting to know you dinner invitation into her mailbox or under her door, “be sure to invite her boyfriend just in case she has one” she says. “Yeah sis, I like that idea, I’ll set it /up for this weekend.”

Jasmine gets home to find a card inviting her to dinner in Apt. 3A under her door when she enters her apartment. “I can’t believe this, what am I going to do?”, “You know what, fine, fine, I’ll get this over with, he’ll see me and make an excuse right then and there why he has to cancel this dinner”, “If I’d opened my door when he first came over, I wouldn’t be going through this hurt again”.

She cleans up, gets dressed and heads over to Apt. 3A, standing outside his door she can barely hear some jazz playing… she thinks, wow he is fine and has taste, my favorite kind of music, she chuckles to herself, “reminds me of the Cosby show, how he’d put on this music and dance with his wife”, “God, I wish I could be Claire Huxtabe”.

Okay girl, let’s get this over with… knock, knock, knock!!

- Inside Apt. 3A - (Part 2)

On the phone with his Mom, “Ma, I don’t know if she is going to show up, but if she doesn’t, most of this food is going to feed a few homeless people I saw a few blocks over by the park”, “Well baby, whatever happens, just know it’s God’s will” his mom says! Knock, knock, knock!! “Oh, Ma, gotta go. I believe she’s here”. “Okay baby, call me later”, “Okay, bye!”.

Marcellus opens his door, standing before him is this beautiful woman with mocha brown skin and hazel brown eyes, all he can do is stare at her!

Jasmine mistakes his stare as one of shock and disgust, she lets her eyes fall to her feet then turns away to go home and cry!

Marcellus snaps out of it and runs after her saying, “Hey, wait a minute, where are you going so fast?”. Jasmine doesn’t look back, she says “listen, I know now that you’ve seen me you have other things to do, sorry if I ruined your appetite”. “Wait.. what?” says Marcellus, “Hold up a second please, miss?”, “I don’t know what I did wrong, and I don’t even know your name”, “Can you please just speak to me for a moment?”.

Jasmine stops outside her door with her key inches from the lock and looks back at him and can see in his eyes that he is sincere, she lets out a pent-up breath and says, “Are you sure you want to speak to me?”. “Yes”, he said!

“Shall we speak here in the hall or would you mind coming inside and sitting at my dinner table with me? Cause I’m famished!”

Jasmine smiled and said “First my name isn’t miss, it’s Jasmine, Ms. Jackson if you must”... that got a hearty laugh out of Marcellus, she loved the way he laughed, genuine, not fake like everyone else. “And”, she said, “I’d hate to keep a hungry man from eating”.

- Inside Apt. 3A -

“You have very good taste and style, didn’t know men knew how to decorate”, “Well thank you Jasmine, Ms. Jackson if you must” he said with a wide smile… God, she loved his smile! She said “Okay, Mr. Comedian, you’ve got jokes”.

They sat and talked for a while, she picked at her food, and when he asked if she didn’t like his cooking, she said “it tastes delicious but I don’t need to be eating with my fat butt”... when he didn’t laugh or smile, she said “What?”.

He said, “Jasmine, why do you do that?”. “Do what?”. “Put yourself down like that, don’t you know you are beautiful?!”. “Oh I get it, you are one of those chubby chasers and once you get what you want you dump her and move on” she said!

Marcellus was hurting inside for this woman who didn’t even know her own worth… he said “Jasmine, I can tell you have been hurt deeply throughout your life, never being shown how special you truly are, never being loved for who you are”. “Who are you Jasmine, do you know”. As he spoke, tears filled her beautiful eyes and began to cascade down her cheeks… Marcellus went on. “I was raised to love everyone, not see color or body types, only the good and bad in people”. “I’m not a ‘hit it and quit it’ type of man, I try to make my relationships last because I want more than what today’s women have to offer.''

“Jasmine, God leads my life, He shows me things, and right now, He shows me that your heart has been damaged over the years, but that a good heart beats inside of you”. “No it does not” she cries, “how can I have a good heart when it has been torn out of me” she says as she gets up and rushes out of his apartment back to Apt. 3B and slams her door.

Marcellus doesn’t see Jasmine again for two weeks, his knocks go unanswered, so he starts leaving letter under her door, with beautiful greeting cards, letting her know she’s somebody, she’s special, that God loves her and so does he!

Everyday, Jasmine comes in to find a letter or card from the fine brother in Apt. 3A, she smiles to herself, she even began to believe the words coming from the letters and cards, people at work have begun to notice the Big woman in the middle office walk with her head up and her shoulders straight back, with a confident look on her face like she knew something they didn’t.

Marcellus was helping this beautiful woman come into herself piece by piece!

- Inside Apt. 3A - (Part 3)

Marcellus is having Bible Study over the phone with his family when he hears a quiet knock on his door, without interrupting his father he gets up and answers his door, Jasmine is standing there with roses in her hand, he looks surprised but quietly ushers her inside. With his fingers to his lips, he leads her to the couch where his Bible is open and his phone is on speakerphone, his Dad is saying “So in the book of James Chapter 2, is telling us that we are not to show favoritism cause it’s a sin, and we are to love our neighbors as ourselves, Amen?” Marcellus says “Amen!” Jasmine sits there taking this all in with awe! Before his Dad hangs up, he says “Son we have to let people know that when Life gives us Trash we have to make Treasures of it, God turns around everything the devil uses for bad into some for good, remember that” “Yes sir” Marcellus says, and then his Dad says when do we get to meet this special Lady jasmine you have been talking so much about?” “Uh, oh, ah” Marcellus can’t get the words out with Jasmine sitting there, her mouth open… “Um Dad, I really have to go now”, “alright Son, I love you, read the Book of Deuteronomy. Chapter 30 for our next Bible Study”. “Yes sir, love you too”. “God Bless You Son”.

Jasmine who is totally speechless has forgotten about the roses she’s been holding, Marcellus who is blushing like a lovesick teenager says “Are those for me?” “Oh, sorry, yes, yes they are… for all you’ve done for me all these weeks”, “and just so you know I looked up all those Bible verses you wrote to me and they opened my eyes to know that I am truly loved, I learned to forgive others and myself, to leave the past in the past and look forward to those things ahead”.

Marcellus was quietly thanking God as Jasmine spoke, God had guided his actions and given him the words to write all these weeks to her.

They sat quiet for a few minutes just looking at one another, then Jasmine spoke first “Marcellus, I don’t know where this goes from here but I’ll be forever grateful to god for putting you in Apt. 3A and my life!” “Jasmine, whatever God has planned for our lives will be, I just pray that whatever it is, we are in one anothers lives!”

- One year later -

“Baby you know we don’t need to move out of this apartment right?” Jasmine asks her husband Marcellus of three months, he says, “Honey, I’ve enjoyed living in apartment 3A with you these past three months but our babies you are carrying will need some space, plus you’re having triplets and I know my Mom and Dad will be here often to spend time with and help us with the babies”, “Don’t forget you sisters and brothers too, I love your family so much”, “and they love you too Mrs. Case”. “Baby it’s still hard to believe your name is Marcellus Justin Case”, “I know, I was the one on the receiving end of the jokes growing up but love got me through!” “Thank you, for rescuing me” says Jasmine!

Jasmine was saved, a good heart and love is all that’s required, now you readers show your love and good heart to someone today.

God Bless You All!
