**by Michael Lanning**

The basketball court was at the far end of the park where the adjacent woodland area was dense with trees and shrubs. Normally,the court was full with older boys, and since I was much younger and smaller, no one picked me for their team. I succumbed to being left on the sidelines to watch the game. I knew I wasn’t sports material: I wasn’t tall or big, but I still liked to play. This evening, I had the court to myself. I enjoyed the cool breeze while shooting hoots, though the ball rebounded more into the woods than through the net.

On one occasion, I ran into the woods after a ball to find an older boy leaning against the tree, foot atop the ball. I asked for my ball, and when he told me it was his now, I became worried, mostly of returning home without the ball. What would I tell my parents? I pleaded almost to the point of tears. He said he would return it if I did him a favor. What? “Follow me and I’ll show you.” He picked up the ball and walked deeper into the woods until we came upon a secluded spot.

He instructed me to kneel before him while he let his pants and boxers fall to his knees. I was frightened yet fascinated. Here, inches from my face, was his taut yet smooth muscular body growing before my eyes. “Go ahead, you know what to do,” he said as his stiffness flinched.

Is it written on my face? Do I look or act a certain way? I’ve seen magazines, but this is real. What I thought about is now happening. As he vanishes within me, only to reappear again, I imagine every sensation he’s experiencing by my control. Inducing to memory every moanful moment for replay when I’m by myself. After numerous licks of his lollipop, I reach the center. I’m told I did an excellent job, and I smile as I retrieve my ball, feeling good about myself, being comfortable knowing who I am and that I just did my first job of hopefully many.
