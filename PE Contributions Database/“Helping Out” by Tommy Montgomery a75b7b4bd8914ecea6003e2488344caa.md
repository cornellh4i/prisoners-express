**“Helping Out” by Tommy Montgomery**

The word addict and addiction is more associated with drugs, alcohol, food, sex, and anything that is considered to be bad for you.

Well, not in my case. I can’t stop helping people out no matter the cost. I’ve lost more in life and stressed more than anything because of this addiction. No matter if I’m being used I can’t seem to stop, even knowing this fact. If I can’t help, I have no purpose. Some people use drugs or sell their body to feel good about themselves. If I am stopped from helping out I feel worthless. Helping out is my addiction. Crazy, aint it.
