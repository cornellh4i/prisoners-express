**Prisoner Lives Matter by Devante Thomas**

Difficult to really feel “Our” Lives matter when a small percentage of individuals deserve freedom.

We daydream of the moment when we can sleep past 6 a.m.; while being held tight. Lovingly, by one we care about, trust, respect and would do anything for.

Why can't Devante cook his own scrambled eggs with diced onion, bell peppers and cheese? Fresh sliced honey wheat bread; baked a few hours ago and ready to make toast! Crispy hash browns, turkey sausage, fluffed white rice, butter and fresh juice- to feed them…

Future family! Because prisoners' lives matter and that could only mean my dreams would... Flourish? But, some feel it's necessary to hold a grudge with their inner Beast still feeding.

I mean... Why do “I” get compared to the “whole” ___ when “I” don't believe “them”?

Devante wants to play the piano after a petty argument, instead of an illegal weapon. Studying unstressed and stressed meter while trying to destress his stress out mind and body. Worrying about proper meter, when he could regulate time he have at some musicians meeting.

You won’t hear me complaining about boredom, being broke or no resources or research tools.

Studying writing styles, which is easier than being influenced by time wasting criminals, manipulators- repeat offenders. Prisoner Lives Matter even when you have agitators, sadistic or insane individuals who sow distrust… repeatedly.

Devante may be a “criminal” still, but back in 2009, he had real positive goals.

Prisoner Lives Matter because we all want to live free and love struggling to understand. Just exist as peaceful role-models, parents, family, friends, co-workers- “ex-convicts” in the truest sense.

“What are you going to do when you get shoved back out into new Adulthood?”

I’ll hum at symphonies, browse through libraries, marvel at museums, art, wildlife and festivals. Devante wants to create music, write meaningful text and repair furniture, detail cars, construction- work!

Devante experiences these premonition-like dreams that leaves him yearning for an end to viruses. COVID’s not the only disease I’m referring to like distractions of social media- it’s prison! These death fences are holding me back from memories of seeing my nieces play in their food.

Waking up at 4:35 am to rock my daughter or son back to blissful sleep.

Or come back from the doctor, saying that I may not be able to reproduce.

All worries I’d rather have in a homeless shelter instead of being hidden from society.

Prisoners Lives Matter even if we die of COVID-19 because some of us do (have family).

Do we get to write a “will” for ourselves and give our loved ones memorabilia?

Can Devante request to be cremated so his body won’t be defiled or abused?

Prisoner Lives Matter when we’ve gone years and decades without sporting handcuffs, added time-shame.

We make phone calls to keep our energy Pure, Active, Happy and not feigning hysteria. Some prisoners didn’t manipulate the system of rehabilitation or have ulterior motives- we desire freedom.

There are a percentage of people who don’t care for Prisoners because of horrific stories of their crimes. Or until they’re in our shoes. They forget about those in juvenile, jail or prison, with actual innocence cases, have been framed or just made a mistake, wrong place wrong time- “wrong choice”. I turn my clogged pores nose up at some criminals and their crimes; but all in all; whoever deserves a change to walk out these fences- will walk out alive and go on to live a life worth telling a story about. Successful stories. You always have your mind tweaked with the tragic or sad stories. The ones that give prisoners a bad review. But, it’s the success stories that give me inspiration and a constant changing mindset in how I deal with this prison time.

My children, in the future, want me to pick them up every time they run up to me and raise them high, spinning them in the air and safely touching their little feet to the hardwood floors or plush carpet.

My future children are why Prisoner Lives Matter.
