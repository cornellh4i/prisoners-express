**How to Fly a Kite by Karen D. Lee**

Being Catholic and growing up in the 1960s was exciting. There was always something going on at the Cathedral. Living in the West side of Houston it seemed like the activities (mostly outside) were unending. Once Advent is over with the celebration of King’s Day in January - the preparation for spring is underway.

My two older brothers, myself and my little sister, Ginger, all started on the construction of our kites. A lot of work goes into a good kite. The right paper, size, design, not to mention the frame and the tail. Construction is based on uniqueness and creativity. All are judged on presentation, set up, lift off, length of time spent flying, and how high it can go. Every kite has to be inspected for originality and confirmed that you made your kite yourself. No professional or parental help is allowed. Kits are sold for the younger ones, but the paper is white so it has to be decorated on your own.

My two older brothers always make those box kites. But this year - 1970 - they wanted to experiment with a dragon kite. They both studied all year to get the design just right. Of course they kept it all hush hush. Boys. My sister and I stayed with the simple design. Just the diamond shape. Decorated with flowers and a peace sign. The tail was multicolored. I liked it and it was sturdy. I made sure we had plenty of string and it was tied off to the next roll. One year I forgot to rewind the string and tie it off. Yes the kite flew away - we were disqualified. This year I was ready. Though I did not actually get out and practice I explained to my sister that she should have to be the runner and I would be the handler. Once the kite was up I would take over. She was nervous and scared. I am a year older than her. Actually fourteen months and 15 ½ days. Anyways we always worked as a team like fraternal twins.

I could not run anymore. I was hit by a car when I was small and it messed up my right knee and right hip. I walked with a limp. Though I tried I just could not run. I could not participate in any games that required running. I could not even roller skate. It was torture as a child to sit on the side lines and watch your friends play ball and you can’t. Still as an adult, I can’t run.

So here we are, Us four kids. March 17th, St. Patrick’s Day. Out in this huge field that seems to go on for miles and miles. Every team of two set up and was ready to take off when cued by the judges. My sister was so nervous she threw up her lunch. But I assured her all will go well. Just don’t think  about it.

We got our cue, we looked at each other and my sister just froze. I told her we can’t back down now. So I took a deep breath and told her “I’ll try to go and if I fall I will get up and keep trying.” I was thinking that we were going to be disqualified.

Now I don’t know what guardian Angel showed up but one did. I was a runner and my sister was a handler. I checked the line and off I went. I’m doing this step swing right leg step sorta limp run and just then, after a few steps this breeze comes out of nowhere and lifts the kite up. I literally have tears in my eyes. The kite is in the air and staying there. I had it up in the air for almost an hour which is great. We did not win or even place, but I just could not believe we got the kite up without running. Running is just one of those activities people take for granted. As a child it is more than a part of everyday life running is being able to fly on your feet. Running is freedom, it is really living. Whenever I am down. I remember this day. I was really free.

I can’t run at all. But after ten years in a wheelchair I am learning how to walk and it is a very freedom feeling.
