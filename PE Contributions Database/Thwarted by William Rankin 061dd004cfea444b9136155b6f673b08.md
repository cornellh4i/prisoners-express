**“Thwarted” by William Rankin**

I grew up in America as not only an African-American, but also as an active gang member. It is not hard to see my downward path in life. As you can imagine, trouble was one of the easiest things for me to find myself in. Armed robberies, fist fights, drugs, and guns are just to name a few. I found myself between a rock and a brick wall. Prison and rival gangs. The people around me said I was heading to self-destruction (death). I had pretty much resigned myself to the inevitable. I mean, the enemy was on all sides, then boom! I found myself in prison where I am expected to continue in life, blind and ignorant. Well, I am proud to say that through self-education and perseverance, the plot to strengthen the mental chains have been thwarted. I now have a better understanding of the overall systematic obstacles set in place for the African-American. I am glad to say that my outlook on life has taken a complete 180.
