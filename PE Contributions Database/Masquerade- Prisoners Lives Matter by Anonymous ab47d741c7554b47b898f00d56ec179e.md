**Masquerade- Prisoners Lives Matter by Anonymous**

The COVID Ball, a healthcare smash,

Defiant faker chasing fame;

“Reopen states”— A bedlam bash—

A waltz of scorn— a surge of shame.

He stands exposed, above the law,

Below the belt, his words are precise;

Without a doubt, without a flaw,

He helps himself at any price.

His plans unveiled, a plague of tears,

Bedeviled bungler’s tasteless Tweets;

Divide & Dupe— seduce with fears—

He touts untruth with gruff conceit.

“The Overrated virus tests!”

Ignoring facts, the hate he stokes;

As families lay their own to rest,

He lies upright, “It’s just a hoax!”

“Reopen schools!” The game’s begun—

He throws them bones, we hold our breath;

Our children’s dreams and hopes undone

As time unmasks the face of death.
