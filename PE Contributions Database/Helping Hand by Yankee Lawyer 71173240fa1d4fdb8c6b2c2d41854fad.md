**Helping Hand by Yankee Lawyer**

My wife, Pamela, used to bathe our children every day. Our daughter’s skin remained clear and healthy: but our son, Bobby’s skin couldn’t replace its protective oils fast enough. It lost its shine, whitened, cracked open and bled.

Pediatricians and skin doctors told Pamela to wash the children’s hands and faces but not to give them complete soap baths more than four or five times a week. That seemed sensible to me. My brothers and I turned out ok. Although I don’t think my mother bathed any of us more than three or four times a week.

Although I protested the frequency and serenity of the children's baths, I was available to lend their mother a helping hand. I lifted them out of the sink, Pamela said her hands were wet and slippery. Dried them off and put clean diapers onto them.

I gently rubbed medicine into Bobby’s inflamed, scaly skin.

No, dear reader, I’m not going to drone on and on about baby powder and Pampers: but the idea of changing diapers and putting clean clothes on babies and toddlers seems to have held great fascination for Robert Johnson, the district attorney at the time. He’s now a judge. What about the babies’ privacy? He wanted to know.

I’m a Christian from Massachusetts. In my culture, we’re concerned about keeping their bottoms clean and dry. Their real or imagined need for privacy Is not an issue.

Pamela was treated as an unindicted conspirator. She gladly allowed the D.A. to use her as a confidential informant.

I’m now a political prisoner In one of the most oppressive prisons in the south. The next time I’m approached by someone who seems to be doing something positive in North Carolina, I’ll think twice before lending a helping hand.
