**Spring Fever By Leo Cardez**

I pissed on my celly today. I literally have Spring Fever. It’s the first day of Spring and I have a 102 temperature. It was the perfect storm. I had been in and out of consciousness all night alternating between shivers and sweats. At some point In the middle of the night I stumbled out of my top bunk and over to our in-cell toilet. My celly had fallen asleep with his head just a few feet from the toilet. Normally, he sleeps on the opposite side, but he had passed out watching TV. I remember I tried to angle myself just so to block his view and that of any passing officer. It all went sideways from the go. A strong split stream shot out creating a perfect 90 angle that smacked my celly right In the face. For a half second I was frozen in shock simply watching him wake up to a golden shower. I tried to jerk away while pinching down, but It only made things worse. The fire hose flow soaked my celly’s bed.

“What the fuck?!”

“Holy shit bro, my bad.”

“The fuck you talkin bout my bad? You just fuck’n pissed on me!”

I really thought we were going to fight. I figured I probably deserved It. This is prison after all and I don't care how cool you are with your celly--this is some lace-up-and-meet-you-by-the-shower type shit. He ranted and raved and stomped around eventually catching the attention of an officer who mercifully let him take a shower and use the washing machine while trying not to crack up about the whole thing. He also sent me to healthcare for my fever which had reached 104 and scored me a trip to the hospital. They diagnosed me with a severe case of strep throat which required being quarantined In a single man cell in our healthcare building until my fever broke. This gave my celly a few much needed days to calm down and me time to plan. My strategy: Deny, Deny, Deny. As Shaggy would say, “It wasn't me,” and thanks to my high fever, he bought it… I hope he never reads this.
