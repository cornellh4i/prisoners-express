**“State Pen Sherewolf” by Lorraine “Black Rain”Bennett-Kenitzki**

Once upon a time in an old, old prison, not so long ago was an inmate so beautiful that no one could resist her.

Man, woman, (and even a few beasts) were instantly attracted to her.

Some, it had been said, had lost their minds over her.

Some had to quit their jobs in order to restrain themselves and protect their reputation.

But in spite of this woman’s beauty, she had a mischievous streak about a NASCAR race long.

Mean too.

Often times she would tear off all her clothes and run screaming, naked through the halls.

She’d even fly off tables or jump off the rails of the upper tiers.

No matter how good they would secure her in shackles; the best of restraints failed, no matter.

No matter how strong of a dose of medications, tranquilizers and such, she would end up free, wild, and maniacal laughter would fill the halls again, and again.

It would take so many guards to take her down that sometimes they had to call in back up from the local law enforcement.

One time they called in the National Guard. But after they secured her, the guardsmen became so enamored by her that they just knew they’d have to find a cell and lock her up far, far away from everybody.

How could they get away with it?

Well, no one ever visited her.

She never got any mail, well, not from people outside the prison. She did receive plenty of letters from the many infatuated ex-guards.

She never called anyone.

Heck, the prison wasn’t even sure why she was in prison to begin with. Her record was very long and extensive. She had sentences that overlapped other sentences that ended, and started anew.

So they put together a cell in the basement part of the old prison. This part of the prison looked like the kind of dungeons that old castles had.

Then they figured out a way to dolly down her food and supplies in a secure dumbwaiter. No one dared to go down to her cell; for some, in doing so, went mad with lust and some never came back from their descent.

Once in a while, every 28 days or so, there’d be such a ruckus from down below that some rookie would cave in and take a look via video technology. But to their chagrin they’d be lovestruck by her beauty.

Some said the noise was like howling, and broken concrete, but never a bar was bent, nor a brick out of place.

One day, the Warden said “this is insane, we can’t keep this up! What if the ACLU finds out?”

“We can’t lose any more guards!”

So, they sealed up the basement, filling it with dirt, and covering it up with concrete.

They kept the plumbing intat. Little, by little. One by one. Staff forgot about her. New staff were hired, and were never told about her. Eventually staff even forgot to use the dumbwaiter to feed her.

Now and then, every 28 days or so, the inmates and staff would hear a howl so pitiful it’d break the hardest heart into pieces. By now, anyone who knew about her was long gone, dead, or long gone dead.

Every so often inmates would disappear. Guards and other staff too. None suspected a thing. What would they suspect anyways? Inmates get transferred and released all the time. Guards and staff quit, change jobs, and transfer too!

Every 28 days or so, in the Boise prison of old, you can still hear her howl, and wonder, the next day where your bunkie had gone in the middle of the night.
