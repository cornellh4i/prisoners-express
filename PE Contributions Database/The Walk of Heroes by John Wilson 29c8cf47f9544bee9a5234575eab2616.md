**"The Walk of Heroes" by John Wilson**

Jacob stood on the jetty and looked out over the swim to a pier that began in the midst of deep water and stretched out until it met the horizon.

It was called the walk of heroes. Everyone on the island knew the lives they would live, the jobs they would have when they grew up, even who they would marry. There were no surprises, no room for anything beyond the ordinary. The walk was for those who wanted more. They were few with many years between them. No one ever returned from that walk to tell what lay beyond. All that was known was that the walk was for those who wanted to seek their destiny. It was for heroes.

The noise of the crowd behind him made for a brief distraction. Everyone came to see if he would attempt the walk. Most waited with silence and bated breath. A few jeered and scolded, telling them to come down and do something productive, to quit wasting their time; he was no hero. That last part stung; it goaded him into action. He dove in and began to swim.

It was longer than it looked from the wave-splashed rocks he’d stood on. His arms began to burn before he was a quarter of the distance. The salt water stung his eyes and got in his mouth with each gasping breath. He didn’t race, just kept his arms and legs moving in a steady rhythm.

When he rolled onto his back to float and rest for a moment, the people on the beach were small blurs. He returned to the swim.

It felt like a long time later, but he felt strength returning to his limbs. He lifted his head from the water and laughed, then dove under the surface. He kept his direction toward the pier, but he began to play in the water. Leaping and diving again, rolling in eel-like undulations, breaching the surface to laugh again. That burst of energy and giddiness carried him the rest of the way. He pulled himself onto the planks and collapsed, his muscles suddenly as fluid as the ocean he was just swimming.

He lay there a while before he gathered the strength to sit up and look around. It had been morning when he started and now the sun was well into afternoon. He was hungry, but with nothing to do about that, he shelved it in the back of his mind.

The pier was strangely unweathered. Each plank was buttery smooth, golden wood with the faintest graining. It stretched off into the distance, giving no clue what lay beyond. He looked back to the beach. The crowd had dispersed long ago, leaving only a few solitary watchers to see if he made it or not. He had gone too far to turn back now. A few would-be heroes drowned, others gave up or grew so tired that the current and tides carried them back to the beach.

The salt had dried on his skin. Jacob stood and stoically began to walk. The sun burned his skin, he was tired and thirsty and hungry. He was beginning to wish he’d stayed on the island, had never set out to seek destiny. Still he walked. There was only the pier, the endless water around it, and the sun.

He kept walking. Slowly, the sun sank and twilight set in. The first star showed itself. The smooth wood of the pier was easy on his bare feet, but his muscles still felt flaccid after the long swim. He was on automatic, walking only because there was nothing else to do.

As night set in, Jacob saw a light. He began to hear the gentle sound of waves rolling in on a beach. Both were still far off and he thought he was imagining them. He kept walking. The hallucinations refused to fade.

As the sun rose, he saw the end of his road. A small peninsula jutted out to meet the pier. Two trees framed a square shack, and more concrete created retaining walls enclosing several small garden plots. An ornamental waterfall poured into the ocean.

His step quickened. He left the pier and began to mount the concrete steps that wrapped around until they led to the shack’s single door.

Inside was a table, a bed, and a stand with a pitcher and basin to use as a sink. A mirror, bright and polished, hung above it. An older man sat at the table, a cigar burning in a crystal ashtray and a cane leaning beside him. He paused in the act of taking a drink from his glass when Jacob’s shadow darkened the doorway. “You’re from the island, then?”

Jacob could only nod, his mouth parched and salt-dry. His eyes hadn’t left the man’s glass, though the smell of coconut and alcohol stung his nose even from the door. Dazed, Jacob wondered where he’d got rum when neither of the trees outside were coconut.

“Of course you are. Nobody else comes here. Let’s get you fixed up. Welcome to Waystation.” He said the last with a flourish as a top hat appeared and rolled down his arm to his hand. He put it on his head with a sly grin and then used the cane to lever himself up.

Jacob followed him stupidly as the man filled three tin buckets in the waterfall. “Here, hold these,” he said as he handed two to Jacob. The weight tottered him and nearly pulled him to the ground. Again, the man grinned, a mocking edge to it. “That journey takes a lot out of you, doesn’t it?” He led Jacob to a wooden stall behind the shack, where another bucket hung. This one had holes in the bottom, allowing the water to shower down. Jacob turned his fact to it, then let it run into his mouth. He spit to clear the salt from his mouth, then drank mouthful after mouthful of the cool, sweet water.

After the first bucket ran dry, the man handed Jacob a rough cloth and a gray bar of soap. “I’m sure I’ve got some clothes inside that will fit.” These turned out to be denim pants and a homespun shirt. It scraped against his sunburned shoulders.

Once he finished the shower, Jacob returned to the shack to find a sandwich with a glass and pitcher set out on the table. Condensation beaded the pitcher’s sides. He ate and, at the man’s urging, laid on the bed. He fell asleep instantly.

When he woke it was dark again. He stood and stretched, then caught a delicious aroma as he yawned. He went outside, where a small fire kept the stewpot above it at a steady boil. The man saw him and beckoned him over. “It should be—” He tasted it with a long spoon. “Ready.” He handed Jacob a tin plate and spoon, then ladled a generous helping onto it once Jacob had sat down.

“What is this place...this Waystation?”

“It’s a place where heroes can rest and recover before they set out on their quest.”

There was no more conversation as they ate.

Then, Jacob asked, “So where do heroes go after this?”

That mocking grin flashed briefly in the firelight.

“Wherever destiny leads him.” After that, he refused to answer any more question, saying that he was going to sleep and, since Jacob had his bed all day, it was only fair that he would have it all night.

The next morning, Jacob woke to see the man with a packed bundle tied to a long stick. “Where are you going?”

“Where my destiny leads me.”

“But, I’m the one supposed to be doing that.”

The old man shook his head ruefully. “Don’t they teach the rules anymore? Here’s how it is. I was caretaker of Waystation. Now you’ve come to relieve me of that duty and free me to seek my destiny. You’ll be caretaker until the next hero comes along.”

“But that could be twenty years! What am I supposed to do?”

The man spread his hands, a doleful expression on his lively face. “It could be. Or it could be tomorrow. In the meantime, tend the gardens. Eat the fruit from the trees. The birds will provide you with eggs and, if you’re quick and clever enough, you can eat the birds. You’ll do okay.”

“If I wanted to tend gardens, I could have done it back on the island.”

“True.” The man shouldered his bundle.

Jacob thought quickly, looking for a way to leave. Then, an old story gave him the perfect answer.”Care to bet on it?”

The man lowered his bundle to the floor. “A wager? To see who goes and who stays?” Jacob nodded. “What’s your game? Dice?” He rattled a cup that was suddenly in his hand.

“Too much chance involved. Your hands are too quick for that.” That elicited another edged grin. Jacob asked, “How about chess?”

The man shook his head. “Too rigid. Not enough chance involved.” He grinned widely. “But I know.” He pulled a chess set from his pack and a deck of cards from his pocket. Once the board was set up and they’d used a hand-guessing game to determine that Jacob would play black, the man began sorting out cards.

“Now, there are six different kinds of chess pieces.” He laid out all four kings and queens, then the two jokers, then the aces, twos, threes, fours, and fives. “So we assign a type of card to each piece, with pawns getting both the aces and deuces.” He returned the remainder of the deck to his pocket. “Shuffle those and deal us each five cards. Threes are rooks, fours are knights, and fives are bishops. Jokers are wild. Draw from the deck and discard one that represents the piece you’re going to play. Red cards are white, black cards are black. You can move your opponent’s pieces if you play a card.”

Jacob thought for a moment to be sure he had the rules down, then smiled. “Just the right mix of chance and strategy.”

“A crossroads of sorts.” He drew, played a red two, and moved his own king’s pawn.

Jacob responded, playing an ace and moving one of his own pawns.

The game took three days as each checked his hand to see what moves were available and then studied the board to see which would be most advantageous. They paused to eat, but not to sleep. When they ran out of cards to draw, they took turns shuffling the discard pile.

“Checkmate.” Jacob rubbed his gritty eyes after he moved his final piece into position and declared the win.

“Well done.” The man slid everything into his pack and shouldered it again.

“But I won. Where are you going?”

A jaunty grin. “Jacob, you’ve done something extraordinary. Just like the hard journey here was a test, so was this. You could have just waited until I was out of sight and went your own way. But you didn’t just break the rules set by the status quo. That lies the way of the villain. You chose to do what a hero would; you changed the rules and pushed them beyond what you were told was possible. You risked your destiny, or so you thought, but in doing so you were truly setting out to find it. Even had you lost, I would have told you all this. We both would have left Waystation.”

“But who will be the caretaker?”

He chuckled. “This old place can take care of itself. It has done so long before either of us came here. It will tell its secrets to the next person to come here.” He handed Jacob a pack, similar to his own but smaller. Together, they stepped out. Jacob swung shut the wooden door, made of the same golden planks as the pier, and the old man slid the bar in place to hold it.

“But you did win. I could say the wager is null, but I’ll give you something equally valuable to what you thought was at stake. My name is Eshu Elegbara. Just once, you can say it at any sort of crossroads. I’ll hear and come to your aid.” Before Jacob could respond, Eshu tipped his hat and set out along a path, whistling a happy tune and not seeming to need his cane.
