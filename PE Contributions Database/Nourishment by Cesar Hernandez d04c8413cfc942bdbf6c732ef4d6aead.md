**Nourishment by Cesar Hernandez**

As human beings, we’re asked to choose more than once between inhabiting life or consuming life, between finding our kinship with others or trying to manage and dominate the things around us. Every day, we’re given the chance to lean into life or turn away. These basic covenants make all the difference.

Consider the Butterfly Effect, where the slightest movement of a butterfly’s wing in South America could become a mammoth wind after building for a thousand miles, or how a small wave can become tidal after travelling across the ocean. Likewise, our slightest turns away from life can create tides of separation after crossing the ocean of time. Our slightest leanings towards life can begin a golden age of cooperation, waiting to happen a thousand years after we are gone. What we do matters, when it arises from the essence of our being. Our deepest longings join with the tides of life to set great confluences into motion. When we show up with who we are, we join with other lives, the way atoms form into molecules. This joining of aliveness is at the heart of all creation.

On the other side of ambition, we learn that being who we are is how the heart learns, while arriving at understanding is how the mind learns. We need a working harmony between the two. Letting go of the reigns humbles us unto bettering ourselves by inhabiting the simple motions of our lives and immersing ourselves in work that is real.

Carrying only what is necessary, we can see that the things that matter are everywhere, like secrets hidden in the open. Who would have imagined - the world is only hidden because we believe it needs to be. Often, we get in our own way, layering assumptions and conclusions like blinders over the fresh experiences of simply being here. All the while, we’re asked to participate in life and not control events. In very real ways, suffering and beauty return us to direct living.

Our skin thins the longer we’re here, and therefore holds its markings. In the same way, we’re more permanently touched by the world the longer we’re in it. The longer we live, the more we hold the world’s markings. As it should be, the reward for getting closer to life.
