**Stars by Jeremy Brown**

****You can’t see stars in the city anymore, especially in prison. However, every now and then, I see a shooting star or meteorite come into contact with the outer reaches of our atmosphere. Three weeks ago I saw a very bright and still star. Everyone thought it was Venus, but it was a 1.2 billion or million dollar satellite launched by the NSA as a security or spy satellite. Who knows.

Due to light pollution, we can’t see as much as the ancient people. We have to rely on telescopes and computer images. Yet at heart, I’m a stargazer. It’s amazing to see in real time the universe unfolding before our eyes. Stars let me know something else is out there. Something better. I can see Orion’s belt sometimes and Pyxis. I love to read books on the Hubble and astronomy and try my best to save any pictures of the Cosmic Universe. It’s like looking in the mind of God. our brains and neural pathways resemble the stars and planets. We are a microcosm of the stars--energies of the universe. Maybe someday, we will become a star and with little constraint, move vast distances. It takes 90 light years to get to Alpha Centauri, our nearest star. By the year 2100, we will have the technology ready to get there. An intergalactic spacecraft with Hydrogen or nuclear fusion and with an outer hull that revolves around a central unit, creating its own center of gravity. This is being proposed by think tanks for NASA. It’s not realistic yet, but it’s fun to speculate. Imagination is creation.
