**“Emerging From the Fog” by Miguel Sheesh Lara**

Another dawn, still hungry. As the fog clears, the sun shines through and my stomach is still growling. Doesn’t matter if I travel in a pack, a mob, as a pair, or just solo. It’s so hard to find good eats anymore. I can recall the good ol’ days, when food was just running wild, ready for the pickings. Recently, I haven’t smelled or heard a nice piece of game in several dawns. I wonder what it was like before this, before I craved brains for eats, before the endless nights. Or was there ever a before? Who knows, my memory is foggy and the hunger just overpowers all. I do recall when a fog was a zombie’s greatest scene. Nobody can see, but you can hear and smell all the game screwing around, like easy pickings. Each dawn came with a new fog and great eats. Best breakfast ever, but recently the dawn just brings more hunger. I haven’t had breakfast in a while, and let’s not even get into lunch or dinner. How long am I going to have to keep moving, eating, standing, listening, wondering, before the hunger stops? Never satisfied. When is the fog going to clear? Like it does each dawn, but in my mind. Then hopefully I can recall how it was before the endless nights and bottomless hunger. Did I have people who cared? Was the hunger ever over? All I know is this life as a zombie, a zombie is what the game call us as we chew through them. I’m dying to see what’s next and wonder if there ever was a before. Until the next group eats I wander and wonder.
