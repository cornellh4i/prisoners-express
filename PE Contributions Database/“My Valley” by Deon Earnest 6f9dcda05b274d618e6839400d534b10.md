**“My Valley” by Deon Earnest**

I have visions of the valley of the shadows of death which patiently waits for me. It’s a place where I can climb the highest peak, where I can touch the sky and release all the stress and pain that my life has brought to me. I can’t sense the smell of nature because this is only a vision, but I can see the pine trees and imagine how they smell. Without another soul in sight, I’m free to roam the rugged terrain alone. It’s a cloudy day that hasn’t produced neither a thunderbolt nor a raindrop. I can’t feel the wind as the clouds move, and I can’t yell at the top of my lungs to see if I can hear an echo. I know there’s no one to answer back.

It’s a place of peace and solitude that’s unlike the violence in the ghetto worldwide. No news to watch about another human being getting killed. No government writing laws about how I should live. No drugs to take that try to give me a better sense of reality. Not by my hands will another person be a casualty. I am seeking all of this because it’s my future reality. Yes yes yes. This is my valley, and it awaits patiently.
