This is a good word… Lost my MIND! Lost my keys… Lost WEIGHT… I was lost but now I’m found! Don’t get lost!

I was told one time by a professor to not say “I lost weight,” for your mind will go looking for it!

Like one time I was looking for my cousin’s car in the parking lot, I was lost, even he couldn’t remember where he parked (LOL). I think after the movie we eventually found where we parked! Smoke another bowl, LOL!

Have you ever went looking for your lost glasses? Go out in the garage to the car, not there! Look on the counters, desk, dressers, on man, I can’t seem to find my lost glasses. But you put your hands on the top of your head to remember and guess what? Your glasses (LOL)! Talk about losing your mind!

Lost in a crowd? You can be in a crowd of people, a party, and be by yourself, lost, attempting to be found by someone, hopefully!

Yet I like to say, we’ve all been lost yet Jesus Christ found you when you asked to be his friend-- Rev 3:20.
