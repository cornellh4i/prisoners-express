**“The Black Widow” by Katherine A. Hatten**

The scene opens at the memorial service for Hercules. His wife and murderers, the lady Deianira stands there watching the mourmers, listening to her own thoughts…

… “Why did I do it? I should have known that the gift Nessus was one of sorrow. No gift from a rival does good for a man. That damn shirt! I was so damn blinded by my jealousy of young Tole, whom Hera made me believe was dying for my husband’s love, blinded me to reason. All I wanted to do was ensure that I kept his love. How can I make this right? I will have to die as well I guess, but not until after I have avenged poor Hercules. How do I do that when that accursed centaur is already dead? I will have to plead my case to Hades who knows the perils of love quite well. Did he not meet failure head on when he abducted his bride? What do I offer him though, to torment Nessus? Could I? No. Power? I don’t have any. I know! I’ll offer to suffer the same torments as the centaur for my part in the death of Zeus’ son.”

Quickly did these thoughts race through her head as she watched those who loved her husband. When she had decided her own fate and plans for revenge she quickly slipped out the door and into the night.

No one knows what happened to the lady Deianira after the death of Hercules. Maybe she swore Hades to secrecy or Hades just didn’t care to tell the tale. Maybe she never made it to her destination. I prefer to believe she both avenged Hercules and atoned for her part-but we’ll never know.
