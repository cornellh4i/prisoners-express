**"Aging" by Randall Howell**

The body is an unusual thing that is not immortal to the passage of time. To watch as the years pass, a person begins to wear and tear, kinda like a Goodyear tire. Humanity struggles to retain youth, even laughing amongst themselves of the possibility of a fountain of youth! Vitamins, healthy food and nutrition bars make up the majority of a lot of people's daily lives.

To consider aging, one must first grow from childhood to adulthood. It is here that one takes into consideration of aging by reflecting on the youth that they once were. Wrinkles, gray hair, decaying teeth, and failing organs are a strong reminder of the aging process. I look back at myself as a child. I can remember standing next to my childhood friends arguing over who was taller than the other. What seemed like a very small scratch at one point and time, hurt worse than anything in the world! Now I don't even realize I have a scratch until I accidentally brush the blood up against something. Last time I went swimming, I felt like I had been through the mill! I can remember going to the swimming pool and staying all day long, and I would only require a nap to be rejuvenated!

I remember my Dad saying, "Son, you're growing like a weed." I know aging is a necessary thing in growing up. I wish that I could stop or at least slow this aging process down so that I could retain my youth. I know the need for vitamins, and I try to learn all that I can about the vitamins that are best for me. I would happily down as many vitamins as necessary if I knew that I could slow my aging down that way.

I look upon aging as I do upon snow that comes with winter, rain that comes with the spring storms and the hot humidity that comes with the summer. To me all of these things are necessary that we may be able to grow to be the healthy wholesome person that we were created to be.

I believe the thing that most reminds us of the aging process is the failure of our organs as they no longer work the way they are supposed to. Our blood pressure goes up, our vision requires us to wear glasses that we never needed in the past! Even our muscles and bones may hurt in some places, to the extent that we require pain medication to relive it.

Overall, my personal opinion of our aging is it is a maturing process, one that we all must go through, and like anything that is taken through a refinery; we are changed from our normal state. Some of us are changing for the good and some for the worse. I believe it is a good and worthwhile thing to age! One thing one can rest assured, after our aging brings our fragile bodies to their end, there is something we attained and shared that will bring good to someone in the end!
