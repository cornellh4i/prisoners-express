**“On the Inside Looking Out” by Katherine Hatten**

You’ve heard people talk about being on the outside looking in. They whine, mope, and carry on about how it must be to live in that building, have that job, or have such a perfect family. What do they know? Do they realize that living in this building leaves me with little money for myself? Did they stop to think that, as a female, my time at my job is pure drudgery, with many moments of sexual harassment and discrimination? And that perfect family? My parents won’t help me and my husband spends his nights in my sister’s bed.

I sit at this window inside my gilded prison looking out at the city below. I see people moving about their lives without a care in the world, or so it seems. I wonder if they have seen their dreams broken and dashed upon the rocks. They still look freer than me. What would it be like to walk among them for a day, just one person in a million? To be someone other than that lonely woman, who supposedly has everything, would be wonderful. My time in this window is sadly the highlight of my day.

People on the outside looking in just don’t understand. They don’t see past their own fantasies to see what is hidden. I’m an intelligent woman in a world where women are still things to be possessed by men. My male colleagues claim credit for my work, because “women can’t imagine these things.” I am a trophy wife in an empty bed and my parents have decided to be oblivious. You want my life? You are welcome to it.

I’m on the inside looking out, and I envy you.
