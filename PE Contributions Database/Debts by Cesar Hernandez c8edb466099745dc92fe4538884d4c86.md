**Debts by Cesar Hernandez**

It seems obvious that the advent of the supermarket and the common use of the credit card has had a tremendous impact on the buying habits of multitudes of people. The endless shopping sprees often lend to careless indulgence. Some Americans spend more each year than they earn - and that down the road, will lead to disaster.

We must be alert to the fact that our increase can be reduced because of an economic slowdown, a physical injury, a company’s change of hands, a fire that burns a property, or a death in the family.

The best preparation for any possible future financial stress is to try  to stay out of debt, share generously with others even in hard times.

Each time we have an urge to spend for another item, it is a good idea to put it on an “impulse list” - date it, wait 30 days and see if you still want to buy it then. Most people who do that generally only buy half of what they earlier wanted.

We should avoid extravagance in our daily living, for if we live in luxury and dress in the very best garments - where is the nonconformity to the world?

Certainly, having closets full of clothes that are seldom used, and having a lifestyle characterized by luxury - is a tragic mistake. Most people would likely do well to take steps towards simplifying their living standards.

Money is one of the most unsatisfying of possessions. It does take away some cares, but it brings with it many additional concerns. There is trouble getting it, anxiety in keeping it, temptations in the use of it, guilt in the abuse of it, sorrow in losing it, and perplexity in disposing of it. One can be surrounded by all kinds of material things, and still sense that something is gnawing a hole in the heart.

We are told that contentment is great gain. There is a satisfaction which ought to characterize us. We must not be satisfied with what we are (for there is always room to improve our character), but we should constantly work at being satisfied with what we have, contentment does not come from having all our wants supplied, it comes instead from reducing our desires to include only the essentials of life. We are not to be caught up with the craving for more.

If we have food, clothing, and shelter, we should be satisfied. Contentment consists of being satisfied with the basic necessities of life. It is easy in this age of plenty to become obsessed with the desire to gorge ourselves with unnecessary things. Material things can really get a tight grip on us. It is easy to think that we must have expensive furniture, sleek automobiles, extravagant holidays, up to date everything, etc…

Each of us needs to strive for a happy median regarding material things, seeking to be thrifty without being miserable. It is best for most of us just to have the simple necessities of life - no more and no less.

Nothing impresses an individual with the emptiness of materialism like a trip to a dump. Take a look at everything in these places - all of it was once someone’s treasure.
