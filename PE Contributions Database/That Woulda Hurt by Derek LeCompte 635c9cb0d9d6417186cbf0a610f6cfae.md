**That Woulda Hurt by Derek LeCompte**

I’ve been in prison for 21 years and I’ll be 40 years old this November, 2019. Year after year I reflect and I’ve come to some very interesting conclusions. Despite all the chaos in my youth all the way until my incarceration, things could’ve been worse. Prison for me was likely a way I dodged a bullet. And I’ve never been shot -- so that woulda hurt!

Going all the way back to my childhood. I was tortured. I was beat by most of my mother’s random biker and trucker boyfriends. My family knew it was happening and chose to turn their backs thinking that it didn’t happen if they couldn’t see it. Similarly, my first girlfriend Katie Hagar endured much of the same and she lived right across from my building in our section 8 complex called the Winteringham Village Apartments. You can Google them and see the great reviews (sarcastic). One day, Katie got into an argument with her mother at the top of the steps. In blind rage, she threw a shampoo bottle at her and hit her mother in the head, who fell down the entire flight and died. I never saw Katie again yet it’s been decades and I still love her. My mother chose to abandon me for a boyfriend. It hurt, but it could’ve been as bad as Katie’s case.

With me, what led me to commit my crime, which I didn’t intend the outcome that occurred, was complete hopelessness and lack of self-worth. The path I went down ultimately ended with death. That was my close call. As a boy of late-teens who was abandoned by everyone, homeless, starving and lost, I was on a collision course with destruction. Yet, I still strived for more. I lived in my car and still went to school and got good grades. I tried to get numerous jobs. I tried to turn to welfare, Section 8, shelters and more. I got turned away from everything. Even going to school, they forced me to drop out because I was homeless and without guardians. Didn’t they realize that my free lunches were all I ate? I stared down death one way or another. One blow from him … now, that woulda hurt!

Then I made a stupid decision to try a crime - and I’d never been a violent person. That crime hurt people indescribably while also landing me in prison.

Back to my ultimate close call: Like many people in prison, it literally saved my life and put me back on the path of good. In tragedy I found positive purpose. Now I strive for something higher. In my 21 years, I’ve accomplished things I didn't think I ever would. More than most do even in society. And one of the women I owe my life to, her name is Carol Krych of Positive Resources in Lakewood, New Jersey. She was even honored by President Obama. She helped me avoid my close call. Now, months away from turning 40, I’m in my 2nd semester of college.

I may have more close calls in the future, but I’ve built a defense system to bob and weave them like Muhammad Ali. I don’t want to take any hits to the face… those hurt!
