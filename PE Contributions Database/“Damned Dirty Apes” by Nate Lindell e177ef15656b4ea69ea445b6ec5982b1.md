**“Damned Dirty Apes” by Nate Lindell**

Tomorrow it was Greg’s turn. It would be one of the last surgeries, and he would direct it himself, to people he had trained.

“Drastic problems require drastic solutions,” he himself had announced many times.

The pain he knew he’d experience -- after all, he couldn’t direct a surgery while being unconscious -- wasn’t worrying him. What was worrying him was … something that he couldn’t … grasp, or did not want to grasp.

Humans had brought the Earth to the oblivion of hundreds of thousands of species, created monstrous micro-organisms that threatened most remaining macro-organisms. Something needed to be done!

Five years after Greg and tens of thousands of other doctors, philosophers and scientists agreed to the solution, a humane solution; most of the human population had undergone the procedure.

Greg looked at the feet, cloned from his cells. Soon these feet would replace his hands.
