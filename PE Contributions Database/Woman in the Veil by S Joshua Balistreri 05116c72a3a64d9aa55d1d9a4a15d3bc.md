**Woman in the Veil **by S. Joshua Balistreri**

The day was bleak. The clouds hung heavy and low in the iron gray sky, ready to unleash a deluge at any moment. All around stood people dressed in black to mourn the great man who lay there silent to their tears. Oblivious of their cries. And cry they did.

To them he’d been a saint. A man with whom they’d put their trust, their loyalty, their love. To them he could do no wrong, nor had he ever. But of those gathered around that muddy hole in the earth that would soon engulf his still, lifeless body, all dressed in the finest silks and enclosed in the best casket money could buy, who really knew him?

She did. She knew him intimately and in ways no other soul on this planet could. She had seen behind the acts of greatness, and knew the true motivations for them. She saw his strengths, his weaknesses, his flaws. She knew, if anyone could, his mind.

Through her veil she scanned her surroundings. Beyond the gathering of mourners, the lawn of the cemetery stretched out into the distance. The headstones, some incredible works of art, decorated the lawn, casting a macabre sense of beauty onto the scene. Large oak and elm trees dotted the landscape in a seemingly random, haphazard layout. The grass was all lush and green, even in the dismal light and many of the graves were wreathed with fresh flowers.

A beautiful place to rest. She had doubts that rest would really be what he was getting. Not if there was any justice. No, he would not be in a place of serenity. He would dwell now in eternal torment and agony. And so, someday, would she.

She peered around her at the distraught faces. Cry for him, she thought. Pray for him even. None of that would help him now.

Yes, she knew him. She knew the real man he was and he was, by no account, a saint. Nor was she.

Yes, she would someday face the same torment that he now faced, burn in the very same fires. But the only thing that mattered was that he had gotten there first.

She had made sure of that.
