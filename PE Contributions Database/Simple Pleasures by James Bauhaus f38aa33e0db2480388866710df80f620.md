**"Simple Pleasures" by James Bauhaus**

Some simple pleasures will drive you nuts!

Like all these inmates seeking cigarette butts,

They're combing the grass and in the trash can

Every stogie they find is their favorite brand!

Mooch a paper, bum a light,

Gasp! Wheeze! Pure Delight!

Heads all a-buzz, full of nicotine,

Next high to chase? That's Caffeine!

Empty cup on their finger, a beg on their lips,

Takes only ten minutes to cop a few sips!

Swig, slurp, splash, and drip

Now they're off another trip!

Coughing and hacking; slinging snot from the nose,

Off on a mission; going to find some glucose!

Too lazy for breakfast; they slept like the dead,

Laid there and snored; missed the syrup and bread,

"Borrow" a Debbie; gobble it down,

Sugar rush! Break dance around!

Let's not forget the nastiest habit of all,

The one when we see it makes our skin cram,

Careful where you walk, lean or sit,

Whatever you touch could be covered with spit!

Suck, chew, this is okay,

Try not to look; have a nice day!
