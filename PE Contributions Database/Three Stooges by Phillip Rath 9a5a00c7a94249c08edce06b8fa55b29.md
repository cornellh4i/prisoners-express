**Three Stooges by Phillip Rath**

Gavin, Zander and Spencer had all accepted the invitations to Halona’s party that Friday after their Senior finals. They had studied hard for the past four years at University and knew this would be their last blowout before graduating into the real world of job hunting and responsibility.

Halona welcomed them to her party, which was already in full swing, at her front door with a compassionate hug for her older brother and two cousins. Halona had seen them struggle through college and knew they’d be there for her through her struggle toward a college degree. That was what family did!

Halona introduced them around to the others at the party and excused herself to bring out more ice from the kitchen and attend to her many guests.

Gavin, Spencer and Zander split up to mingle with the crowd, greet old friends and meet new ones. This was their last blowout and they meant to make the most of it.

There was a little dancing, too much drinking, and too many guests in Halona’s one bedroom apartment. A climb up the Matterhorn would have been easier than making your way through that crowd!

Halona was kept busy seeing to the needs of her guests and would occasionally ask Spencer, Gavin or Zander to lend a hand. One or the other would fill the ice bucket, clean up a spilled drink or refill the chip bowl. Halona was family after all.

As the night wore on, the guests began to thin and the booze took its toll. Zander, Spencer and Gavin were dead on their feet, but all three wanted to stay until the last partiers left so they could help Halona lean up a bit.

As she closed the door on the last departing couple, Halona turned to thank the boys for helping her out, and what does she see, but her brother and cousins fast asleep on her couch - as family.
