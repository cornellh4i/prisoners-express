**“Death (Lose)” By Richard Schmidlkofer**

There are things that are guaranteed, like life and death. I have seen both in my life.

I have seen more death in my life. The first death in my family was my great grandmother, when I was about five. It was hard on me. I’m not sure why; I didn’t know her very well. I had dreams and visions of her in my room. I had nightmares of that.

The next death was the family dog. It was my fault when he died, even though my parents said it was not my fault, and that he was just old. He was old, but he could have lived longer if I did not abuse him.

Then my grandfather had a heart attack. My uncle was overweight and had a bad heart, and a friend’s baby died in 1992. One died each month. My grandfather’s death was hard on me. I was a pallbearer, I almost dropped the coffin. These deaths sent me to the hospital. I wanted to die with them, it was too much for me. I was also questioning God. “WHY would you kill a baby that was just born a week ago?” Then my grandmother had a heart attack and died about three years after my grandfather’s death. She was in a nursing home (I do not like them).

The rest of the deaths since, I have been in prison. My mother died of type-2 diabetes and a bad heart. She refused any more treatment. I had a chance to say goodbye to her, and I told her I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The next day, August 1st, 2009, she passed away. It rained that day- God was crying for me.  I was also in Seg at the time. This was very hard on me. I started cutting myself and overdosed on medication. I have done this a few times. I was even charged with a bill from the hospital the second time. Then it was my great aunt. She died on August 6th, 2016. At the time, I had support from a men’s group called, “Truth Project,” ([www.WisconsonTruthProject.org](http://www.wisconsontruthproject.org/) and email [info@truthproject.org](mailto:info@truthproject.org)). February 3rd, 2019 my step mother died with cancer, she had been suffering for a while.

Death can be sad and happy. Some people have parties at funerals. Some can last two days or a week. Some cultures bring food and burn money to send to another life. There are different kinds of grieving stress; anger, sadness, depression, hurt, alone and lost. It takes time to heal from the pain of your loss. We will never forget their memories, both good and bad. They are always in our hearts.

I miss the family reunions with my grandparents on my dad’s side. A lot of relatives came up on Christmas and in the summer with their Anniversary. These were good times.
