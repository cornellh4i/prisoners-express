**“The View” by Deric Conn**

Nancy looks out to see a view that captures her several times a day. It’s her view, though not for much longer, and no one’s view is quite the same. As she takes it all in, Nancy thinks of all the life before her, of the art and beauty of it all. Inwardly, she mourns knowing that today will be the last time that she will be able to enjoy it. All her things are packed and in ten minutes she will be leaving for Paris.

Mixed in with the sorrow of leaving, is the excitement that she is going on for bigger and better things. A few weeks ago, she was offered to work for an art studio in France where she would be able to showcase her talent on a bigger scale. She quickly accepted the position, glad that she took Advanced French as an elective in college, so that she will have no issues speaking the language as if it were her native tongue.

She hears a buzz in her room as someone on the first floor hits her number to get her attention. She’s brought back to the moment, knowing that buzzing sound means it’s time to go. She looks out the window one last time to say goodbye, to her view, to her home. She hopes that her new place in Paris has a view as memorizing as this one, maybe even better. She turns to plant her feet on the floor to leave, this time keeping her stare away from her view; because even though it’ll always remain hers, she mustn’t allow herself to get stuck in what will now be the past. Her future is going to be bright though right now she doesn’t know just how bright it’ll be. She grabs her belongings and smiles as she thinks of just how big the world really is, of the possibilities that lie before her. And once more she thinks of the view and all that it has taught her.
