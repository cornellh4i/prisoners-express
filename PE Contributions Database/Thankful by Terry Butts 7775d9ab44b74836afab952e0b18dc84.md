**Thankful By Terry Butts**

As I lay, staring out the window, my mind drifts back to a life so long ago. A life before the rapes, beatings, drugs, and attempted suicides.

Life does have a way of bringing about changes, if you truly want it. I would often say “I don’t have a choice.” We all have a choice of which road in life we go down. Life can break of make us

I am very thankful today for the cold, twisted things which have happened to me in my life. If not for those miserable, terrible times, I would have never been the person I am today.

I mean, I don’t believe any of us wake up in the morning saying “Let’s go get abused today,” live in the woods or run down the trailer, just to escape the abuse.

I am so very thankful for those days because they have made me a stronger, more determined person for it. I realize just how thankful I am, to be alive, and in my right mind.

Before coming to this physical prison, I was trapped in my own prison called life. I could never be more thankful that there is a loving GOD above who loves and forgives me., regardless of what I have done in the past.

There is so much to be thankful for. I have a roof over my head, clothes on my back, and food to eat.

The beatings, rapes, drugs, and all the other bad things are far behind me now. I have a chance to move forward and be successful in life. Finally, I’ll be able to fulfill my dreams I have dreamed for so long, like being a part of my son’s life, who I walked out on at age three. Rededicating my life, so I can go to my heavenly home, with my mom who passed away July 2, 2016.

I am thankful for the wide road, for it led me to the narrow road which very few travel on.

Today, I am so very thankful for everything in my life, and the things that are not. Some may ask what does being thankful mean?! To me, it means we are very appreciative and grateful for not only the good things, but the bad ones also.

So let us all try awaking to be more thankful for our life. For we tend to forget where we come from and fall under the same ruts of life over and over.
