**Making Ends Meet by Philip Rath**

“Making Ends Meet” and “Living from month to month” are both rhetoric we commonly hear across America, spanning all cultures and classes. I’ve heard friends use these when searching empty cabinets for some kind of meal for their children, then heard them again from one of my customers when she was complaining about the cost of the newly installed stained glass soffit and matching sidelight.

Clearly there is no definitive meaning of these rhetorical sayings. It is enough to confuse visitors to our country already finding our language hard to comprehend.

To me, it is clear that we really have a large hole in our education system. If our grade school children were taught the basic values of wants vs needs, they would grow up with the knowledge of how to decipher the two words and enable them to spend their money on their needs first and saving towards their wants. Such a deeply rooted value system just might impress upon our subconscious minds that doing without some desired item is not a tragedy or life-threatening event.

Everyday I encounter people who are “Making Ends Meet,” though they are locked in a grey cell 23 hours a day and wearing second hand clothes. These same people are also thankful when one of their wants is unexpectedly realized though not all!
