**“Play Me a Song” by Efren Hawkins**

Play me a song,

That’ll show me all the things I’ve done wrong.

Play me a song,

That’ll change the word coming off my tongue.

Play me a song,

That’ll make my mind get strong.

Play me a song,

That’ll let me know I am not Jim Jone.

Play me a song,

That’ll help me remember the rims that were chrome.

Play me a song,

That’ll show me all the blessings I’ve blown.

Sometimes I need a different type of music to answer different types of questions. So, playing flute to make me float in my thoughts, as I wonder about this and search for answers for that. Maybe the flute will even speak to me and remind me that I have poured out many blessings. Play me one more tune, so my mind can be consumed.
