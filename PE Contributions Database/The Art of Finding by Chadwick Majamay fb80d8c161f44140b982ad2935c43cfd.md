**“The Art of Finding” by Chadwick Keoni Majamay**

Finding is an art of discovery and of original creations leading to the manifestation of creation. Finding the right words to a letter to finding the inspiration to paint an artful masterpiece. The art of finding, for me, has been both a best friend to me through life and a friend who has always supported me through the tribulations of my life. I call the art of finding the art of creating.

From the time I was 3 years old, I had created! Thoughts! I could remember finding myself giggling at the simplest of things that my mind constructed out of objects around me, such as the front of Aunt Pauline’s 1978 Ford Granada and my milk cup. I would think the objects were smiling or laughing, so I did too!

From creation, I form the meanings of expressing one’s self and create beauty, variety, and inspiration. Every thought I form is creation in which creation is born. I create a safe space in my mind to which I go to unwind and relax. Sometimes, it is my laboratory in which I create concepts, ideas, and projects to manifest itself on paper. For example, I had one thought of a way to express the relationship between a car’s acceleration (I know, I’m weird) and its horsepower. From 2009, I had tried ways to conceptualize it into an expression of studying a vehicle’s acceleration and its engine redline, HP and torque curve to output a value for the workload of an engine, according to a certain rate of acceleration. This took 4 years to develop. Creation!

Your idea of finding or of creation is different for each person and is unique to that individual. The question is what will you create? Or find?
