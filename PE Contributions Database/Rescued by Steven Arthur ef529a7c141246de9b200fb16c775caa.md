**by Steven Arthur**

When I started my career as a paramedic, the hair on my chin didn’t connect with my moustache. I was only nineteen, newly married, with a baby mere months away. I was naive of life and oblivious to death. I had never been to a funeral or known what real loss was like.

On my very first emergency call, we responded to a single vehicle traffic accident on the highway. I remember my heart thudding in my chest and my mouth so dry my tongue kept sticking to the roof. Over and over I kept rehearsing what I would do, what I had learned in the classroom setting. This was to be my baptism by fire.

As we neared the scene of the accident, I began to notice small pieces of unidentifiable debris that became larger as the ambulance rolled along. Thick black skid marks leading hard off the roadside caught my eye. Down at the bottom of the embankment near a copse of trees, lay a crumpled up ball of orange foil. The only telltale feature that this pile of discarded sheet metal was formerly a diesel tractor, was a large shredded tire on an aluminum rim. The fire department was already on scene, and I was an extra pair of hands, so I was instructed to prepare the ambulance for the patient.

When the patient was loaded up, the paramedic and his partner were performing CPR. I moved down the bench seat near the patient’s feet to get out of the way. With nothing to do at that moment, I just sat there and watched these seasoned paramedics work. I remember staring at the patient’s bare ankle, thinking to myself, where did his shoes go. A hell of a thing to wonder when the bone in his lower leg protruded through his skin, white and sharp as a shark tooth.

When it was time to leave for the hospital the paramedic looked at me and asked, “You ever do chest compressions?” I shook my head and he responded that I was about to.

In theory, I knew the technique and the ratio of compressions to ventilations, but I had never actually pushed on a human’s chest wall to artificially pump blood through his body. I began tentatively at first, worried somehow that I would hurt him. That was until I was instructed to push harder, deeper by the paramedic. Get the blood pumping through his body and do the work of the heart for it, he told me. And that was what I needed to hear. I gave it everything I had. I let loose of my fears of death and did what I was trained to do. I gave it my all.

When we got to the hospital, an ER staff member relieved me. I staggered away red faced, breathing heavily and drenched in sweat. I knew I had done my very best to give that man a chance.

Despite the efforts of firefighters, paramedics, and ER staff, the man was pronounced dead only minutes after arriving at the hospital. I went outside and sat with my back against the brick wall of the ER and contemplated what I had just been through. I shed some tears and asked if I could really do this. The answer came a few minutes later when the paramedic came outside to join me. He said that although doing the job was emotionally and physically draining he couldn’t see himself doing anything else. We lose some, we save some, but those we can rescue far outweigh any sacrifice we have to make.
