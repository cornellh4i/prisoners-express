**My Wal-Mart Days by Chadwick Majamay**

Wal-Mart has been my life-saver and my friend in my teens and early-adulthood years! Wal-mart afforded me a comfortable life for less as a teenager, and a piggy bank as an adult. Wal-Mart is where I purchased my first stereo system for my room at twelve and my first flat-screen TV as an adult. Here is my experience of a trip…

Everytime I walk into a Wal-Mart store I feel the existence of excitement and the smell of McDonald’s in the air. I turn to the right and see products on clearance and end up picking a few items as I make my way towards the electronics department. My last trip at a Wal-Mart I picked up a 6-pack of generic lightbulbs for two bucks and a 5 CDs of 80’s hits for $5.98.

As I’m making my way towards the electronics department I might stop at the candy section and get a few bags of candy and at the end of the month the personal hygiene department and restock on Suave shampoo, conditioner, speed stick, deodorant, Bod fragrance sampler pack, and my favorite Dove soap.

At the electronics department I browse the cheap collection of in-store brand audio products (Duraband, Lenoxx Sound, etc) and pick-up a $20 Walkman or stereo. Then I’ll go to the computer peripheral section and upgrade my computer speaker system, and pick-up a few software titles for $7.

After I pay for my purchases I hit up McDonald’s and get a #1 supersize (back when they had it), 4 apple pies, and a vanilla milkshake to go. When my meal is being eaten I usually check-out my purchases and read the owner’s manual!

All in all I might spend $100 - $500 a month at Wal-Mart, $2000-$5000 during the holidays. Oh yeah, and I like shopping!
