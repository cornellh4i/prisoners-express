**Gratitude by Charles Yonkings**

In this day and age (especially in the U.S.), it seems that everyone has a complaint, illness or political gripe. Our focus is on what is wrong in the world instead of what is right. You see what you seek and always find what you are looking for.

Please clean the lens and look again, for there is so much to be grateful for. The shining sun from which the light of life flows freely, the food you eat, a small gesture of kindness, the smile of a passing stranger, your parents and the fact that you, in this very body are alive. After all, someone had to take care of you through infancy and adolescence until you could take care for yourself. This precious human birth is indeed something special and rare, so be thankful.

We have the ability to reason, rationalize, love, create, and ponder deep questions. Such as: why are we here? What is our purpose? We have moved beyond mere survival and the never-ending quest for food, clothing and shelter. We create now for the mere joy of creating. Stop for a second and think of all the great things both natural and man-made in this world in which we live and share with all other beings. The mighty Redwoods, the Grand Canyon, works of art, music, the list goes on. Surely you can find one person, place or thing for which you are grateful.

My challenge for you is to rise each day and find one thing to be grateful for. Just pause five minutes each morning and express your gratitude. I promise, you will begin to feel lighter and move with ease throughout your day. And maybe, just maybe, you will smile. After all, gratitude comes from the Latin root “gratus” which means pleasing. So take pleasure in being pleased at what you have.

Another great way to express gratitude is to extend kindness to others. Pass on all kindness shown to you. A simple smile, a helping hand, words of affection or encouragement. You have something to offer someone.

So instead of spreading pain, let us please spread pleasure, love, and joy by expressing the good of this life we all share. Remember, each breath is a gift. Don’t take it for granted. Embrace life with gratitude.
