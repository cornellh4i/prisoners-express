**I Run Fast, But Water’s Faster by Tiffany Toribio**

As I look back on this particular day I can’t help but laugh. Of course when this did happen I was walking back home in tears.

When I was younger I used to hang out with my cousin a lot. We were both the same age - well kind of. I was, in fact, one month older than him. Now being older didn’t necessarily mean I was smarter when it came to ideas.

One day we were playing in the ditch. This ditch was used to irrigate the fields. The water was low and it was flowing at a slow speed. I loved the way the water felt on my feet, but I wanted more of an effect. I told my cousin to help with my shoes. As I climbed out and sat on the side as he stayed in. I sat down and began to take off one shoe. I then handed the shoe to him. I took off the other and proceeded to hand it to him. He reached out to grab it but wasn’t really paying attention. He was focused on a few of our friends who were headed our way. As I let go of my shoe I heard a splash. I began to yell “my shoe! My shoe!” I jumped back in the ditch and ran after it. My cousin ran after me yelling “be careful, the bottom is slippery.” More slippery without shoes. Our friends also began to give chase. They scooped up rocks and threw them in the water hoping to stop my shoe. During this moment it felt like the water flow was coming on faster. After a long attempt we came to a stop, for my shoe flowed into a tube. The tube went into an underground water tank. My shoe was gone forever. I then walked home one shoe in hand and tears falling from my eyes.

Once I was home I hid the other shoe by throwing it on the roof of my house. I never told my mom anything about that day.
