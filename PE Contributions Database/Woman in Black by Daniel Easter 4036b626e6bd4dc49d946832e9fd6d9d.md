**"Woman in Black" by Daniel Easter**

Slowly she crept up to the young man. She knew it would be his time, soon. Her lover would be here, soon. Unlike that dread spirit, though, she covered her face as well as her head. Only her burning eyes shown from the holes in the hood she wore.

She saw the boy turn, seeming to sense her presence. How she longed to reach out to touch him, stroke a finger across his jaw. How she ached to hold him, kiss him. But she couldn’t. Could she?

She was only permitted to hold her lover, his cold bony fingers touch matching her own. His toothy grin, trunin, her spine to ice, was found on many of this young man’s possessions. The sickle in his fingers the signal of dread death.

Maybe one touch would not hurt. She reached for the young man’s hand, wanting to feel his warmth. She saw his eyes go wide as he noticed her eyes on him.

As he collapsed into her arms, Death’s mistress finally held her true love. Her pale lips, hidden by the hood, gently brushed his cheek until it, too, turned cold.
