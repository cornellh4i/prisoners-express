Ahi puchica mi cora through all my travels I would never thought I would end up in a maca with you and our little princess. I can only scratch mi chiba and say to myself - I went to the U.S. to work but instead ended up with prison time. And when I.C.E. came to see me they only ask me “Where did I get them papers?” I could only say “ami no me pica tu english señor”. So they told me that the United States of America don’t deport people like me.

So now that I lay here en esta maca con vos I think of those words that I can’t even call or write to you all, because I went to chase the big American dream - and I ended up with a thirty to sixty year sentence with no friends or family. Just a bunch of scars and empty promises.

And I can only recall those long lazy days laying in a maca with my dos flores,talking about if I went to the “USA”, how better we would all be because of the money.

And now I wake up hoping and wishing I can be with my flores,

pero eso no es asi y solo loque tengo es un deseo de estar a sulado

Pero me piden 85% de mi tiempo para

Yo salir y estar a su lado con tazas de café y tortillas de maseca

En manos eso solo es mi sueño

And this picture brings me back to those lazy days.

But I must wake up from this daydream and go back to my day of three meals and a cot with four walls and a door that is locked. That I can only wish I could take off mi chanchas and hat to rub mi chiba, and think of you as just another lazy day.

That I come to realize I’ll never see or hear of my loved ones again.

But I keep on smiling on because one day all this will be gone. As I know that they took my freedom but they can never take my pride or memories. Even though my body will get battered and bruised, I can always fall back to those lazy days in a maca con mis dos flores.

Es una esperanza hacia pero todos tenemos la misma esperanza.
