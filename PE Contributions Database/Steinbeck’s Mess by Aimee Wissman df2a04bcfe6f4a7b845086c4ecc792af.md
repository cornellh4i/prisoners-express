**"Steinbeck’s Mess" by Aimee Wissman**

I asked Nicole if she wanted to sit a while on the “front porch.” We had about 30 minutes to kill before the yard closed. 30 minutes in the hot sun, fully dressed and bored. There was nothing at all to say; we were both so sick of wasting time.

While the sun was baking, I was thinking about “Grapes of Wrath.” So I said, “You know… I’m staring at my feet, all of the dirt and dust blowin’ around… It reminds me of the Great Depression (that I read in fiction and history books).” Nicole sighed long and said, “Yeah, I’m looking at the fences, and that building with the chimney smoking, and it seems like we’re in a concentration camp.” We half-laughed and went inside. 30 minutes later, they counter our numbers, and I couldn’t help thinking Nicole was right.

Later, in the recovery meeting, Jaime cried. She said, “I had a dream that I was in group and everyone around me was talking and I was screaming, but it was soundless.” She said she couldn’t ever remember feeling loved, that she was looking at her vent, her laundry bag, wondering how CJ did it. She thought CJ was kind of brave in a way, that it took courage to… “Kill yourself,” two words that no one had the courage to say.

Many had sympathy, advice and opinions for her. I tried hard to have open ears, using empathy the way Father Tom had taught me. To really hear the pain, to open up and risk being trampled by another’s despair and confusion.

That evening I sat back down in the dust again. I closed my eyes, and with silent courage, I returned all of our sadness back to the earth. Fod God, I screamed without a sound, and I trust that He listened. When I stood up, there was a Great Depression where I’d sat. I watched until the dusty wind blew away the trace of my shape.
