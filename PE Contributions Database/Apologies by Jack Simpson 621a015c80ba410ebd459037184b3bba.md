**“Apologies” by Jack Simpson**

I have written so many letters to the people I have hurt in the past. Some responded back and some have yet to write. Either way in life when a person has wronged another or felt like they have, then it isn't too late to correct the mistake or at least make an effort.

Someone I had wronged a long time ago when we were just kids weighed heavy on me. That person had moved away and I had never heard from him again. It took the best part of my life to find this person. To my surprise he didn't even remember me or what I contacted him for. Time seems to have a way of healing things and people. I did feel a sense of relief knowing he had put it all in the past and couldn’t recall the wrong I had done.

If we take just a moment to try and fix our past our future will be so much brighter. To some who have never taken the time to correct their past, should sit and think about it for a moment. How the person you wronged felt and what relief inside it gave to both people involved. The satisfaction of having a clean slate to start all over without that large boulder on your shoulder.

There have been times when people who owed me things on the street came to me years later. Only to bring cash in a way of paying me off for hurting me. When a simple apology would be worth a lot more. I will say the fellow would not even look me in the eye as he tried to place the cash in my hands. His hand was trembling as I folded his hand closed with the cash. I accepted his plea - but the cash he took with him when he left.

The day I came in from work, my old pick up and I stopped in the driveway. As my feet brought me closer to the front door, I heard slapping going on. As my hand reached the storm door, my two children were slapping one another. I don't mean love taps. Both of their faces were red and tears streamed out of their eyes. I’m talking young, my daughter was thirteen while my son was nine. After working a twenty-four hour shift at the Emergency Medical Service, I didn't need to walk into nothing like this. I was tired and needed rest and peace and quiet.

I spoke loudly and asked what was going on. They did not stop. I got in between the two and said enough is enough. Go to your rooms. They shut their doors and I asked their mom what was going on; she didn't even know was all I got. I responded and said are you not the parent here. Still she looked dumbfounded.

As I talked to both kids seperate I didn't seem to get anywhere. So I had both of them come to the living room. The two sat on the couch and looked madder than two bobcats right face to face. This was not a fight to see who loved the other one most or anything like that.

I gave them the best piece of advice I could think of. As they turned to face one another, I told them I was not going to spank them for their actions. But instead the lesson they learned would hurt harder. I told them to tell each other one at a time that they were sorry. That they would not fight one another again. They had to hug one another and tell each other they loved one another. By doing this and letting them hug one another and tell each other they loved one another. By doing this and letting them hug one another. This broke the barrier and set up a new way for apologies.

To this date when one needs the other they are there for each other. A hard lesson in life is learned when both parents are not in their lives and simple apologies go a long way.
