**“Emerging from the Fog” by Jesse Clasby**

I am pursued, by an unbearable and relentless terror, that the last shredded fragments of my heart and soul cannot consciously face. A terror that has driven me to the very edge of my own existence. I have fled, enshrouded in an absence of dignity, all the while having this terror doggedly nipping at my very heels. I can go no further! For my feet, my body is torn beyond all recognition. I can go no further! My tormentor is upon me now!

Can you hear the tinge of despondency in the feeble cries of my shattered soul? Can you feel the hollow thuds of the erratic, frenzied beating of my chest? Can you see my silent struggles to breather, for fear’s invisible grasp is squeezing the life out of me. My tormentor is upon me now!

Slowly, victoriously, encircling me! I am surrounded, amidst the wispy tendrils of my tormentors, first gentle waves of vicious cruelty. Tortures I have run my entire life from. Eyes opened or closed, my tormentor will not be deprived of inflicting upon me that which has been long overdue. I will see that which I cannot bear, what I have not had the strength to stand and face.

Emerging from the fog, moments of time portrayed in mere evanescent shades of what has been, what is, and what could have been. There on a small dew encrusted field, plays a young girl of but five years old, chubby cheeked, with eyes a replica of my own. Over there the storming beauty of her mother, with that forever radiant, mischievous smile. Now comes the fire and fury, speaking words I cannot hear, but know by heart. We were destined to be together. A happy little family, but you chose a different path. Abandoning us to a brief figment of imaginations and possibilities. How could you not want us? My loving daughter, casting disappointment, asking why I didn’t want to be her daddy?

Emerging from the fog, my dear grandmother, sitting in her chair at the kitchen table. A sadness clouding the gentle, loving features of her heart. Disappointment in her eyes! Reading thoughts never spoken. Why do you steal money from me, my grandson? Have I ever denied your asking? Flashing to the image of her name on a stone, that I have only seen pictures of.

Emerging from the fog, legions of professionals, all of the same feature. The same thoughts unrelentingly bombarding my mind. You could have been me, or me, or me, or any and all of us. Choices you had. Choices you knowingly and intentionally ran from. Where did that get you?

Reality there, all around emerging from the fog scenes of violence, scenes of depravity, committed and felt. There were moments of despair. Moments of hope. Moments of good happy times. There, times of perpetual loneliness. Times to be proud of, and times to mourn. Times to regret. There, hardships and constant adversity. There, questions of uncertainty, mental stability, depression and insanity.

No! No! I have stood and faced all that you have tormented me with. No, I am not ready to face that. Emerging from the fog, the death of the mother not yet come, but not far off. The look of searing pain in her eyes, and the words silently spoken, that only the heart can hear. Where are you my son? Why are you not here as the light fades from my eyes? Why did you have to go away? Why couldn’t you stay out of trouble, so you could come back home? Why my son? Was not all the love you were given enough to pull you away from that ill-fated life? Why my son?

I cannot tear myself away from this vision emerging from this nightmare of a fog. It holds my body and soul captive, as the last shreds of my heart, my humanity, are torn from my chest, leaving nothing but an inviting hollowness, waiting to waiting to be consumed by all the hate and malice this life I chose to exist in breeds. My own subconscious screams I hear, reverberating back upon me as if from celestial blows of a mighty hammer.

Emerging from the fog, a reality that cannot be denied. Hard as we each think we are, we all have that which weighs heavily on us, that which torments us. At some point over a life sentence, you will reach the end of your endurance, and will have to acknowledge, accept, and face your own demons. I have faced my tormentor time and time again. It has broken me down, and rebuilt me all the stronger, just so it can torment me anew.

My tormentor is upon me now! Emerging from the fog!
