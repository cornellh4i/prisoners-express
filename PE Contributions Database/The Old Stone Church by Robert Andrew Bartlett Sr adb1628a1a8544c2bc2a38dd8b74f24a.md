**The Old Stone Church by Robert Andrew Bartlett Sr.**

My great-great-great-great grandfather built that church. I did some research for the bicentennial celebration last year.

The stone came from a quarry two hundred miles away. There was a belfry but no bell. It was cast in a foundry across the channel, sixty years ago. Where the money came from, I haven’t a clue.

The interior was remodeled about eighty years ago. The floor was redone and all the pews were replaced. The king himself hired the best glazier in the world to replace a few panes, repaint others, and relead the rose window - you can’t see it from here, but they say it was beautiful!

The tower was damaged in World War II. I don’t know what became of the bell.

This township, and my family in particular, seem to have had a rather turbulent history, with periods of wealth and glory alternating with periods of poverty and despair. My grandfather was a bootlegger, my great great grandfather was a smuggler.

I tried to develop a thesis that church attendance increased in times of prosperity and fell off when times were hard. That idea didn’t go far. Today, unemployment is below two per cent, but the church will have empty pews even on Palm Sunday!

Is it possible that church attendance correlates with poverty? I crunched some more numbers. I found better correlation but still not a satisfactory set. The best my AI engine could come up with was a complex and counterintuitive relationship that would go something like this: in bad times, people go to church, praise God and confess their sins. Their problems quickly finish. And good times, people work hard, erect monuments and read self-help books, but problems quickly develop.

How could that be? My dad, a self-made tech millionaire, says the answer is obvious and points to his Bible. My teachers at school said that book was outdated, sexist, racist and violent. We weren't allowed to read it. Maybe I'll check it out though, if anyone ever comes out with a good Bible app for my Obama phone.
