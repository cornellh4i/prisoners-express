**“To Build a Fire” by Frank Olms**

I had just finished reading Jack London’s short story, and wondered what it would be like to freeze to death. I decided to duplicate that event, but without the death.

I was staying in a cabin in the Northwest Territory, taking a break from life in the big city. The snow had been falling lightly for the last two days, and now the temperature was dropping it well below freezing. I thought about the trials of survival -- survival of the fittest.

I put on my mukluks and my parker and my mittens, and trekked off into the freshly fallen snow. The sky was shrouded with ominous dark clouds. The trail was almost unrecognizable as I travelled by instinct. I was beginning to feel the anxiety of being lost, when I heard the bone chilling mournful cry … the cry of the WOLF!

I was being followed!

The cries were becoming louder and there was more than one. They may have followed my scent, even as cold as it was.

They were getting closer.

I had no protection.

I headed deeper into the woods. I dove over a fallen tree to hide. As I hit the ground I scared a large hare which jumped over the tree and ran, unknowingly, in the direction of the wolves …. I heard them coming. I looked out over the tree and watched as four hungry wolves picked up the scent of the hare and ran by.

After a few moments, I heard the feeding frenzy. I jumped over the tree and followed -- hastily -- my footprints back to my cabin.

As I entered the cabin, I noticed on the floor Jack London’s crumbled story, “To Build a Fire” … right where it had fallen from my lap as I slept, cozily, in front of the dying embers in the fireplace.

It was all a dream.
