**Purchase by Tom Farlow**

Of course Viven JAckson knew this had gone exercrablely wrong. She also knew knowing would not and could not fix the problem; solutions fixed problems. The problem right now was there’s a thousand miles ahead with only two feet to propel her and her bag; not going to cut it. That was the “new” problem. She had solved the “then” problems as they dawned into her life. Take the one a couple hours ago.

She was flying along the well-worn, black asphalt in a dingy white 1992 MR2, and by flying she felt that to be literal. Her head and hands were thrust out of the window so that they could splice through the slipstream of air. The golden locks of curls traipsed behind her like the vestiges of empty cans tied to the bumper for newlyweds. Fingers splayed out to cut the resistance down; the scream of joy drowned out in the rush of wind, nothing could hold her back it seemed.

David was behind the wheel. Three hundred miles and four hours ago, he had loaded her into his car. Before that, they had locked eyes across the empty Waffle House and proceeded to negotiate to a neutral booth somewhere in the middle loaded with their plates of shortstacks and cups of joe black. There, he had queried her about movies, music, and opinions on how long an egg should be boiled. She in turn found out he was driving his brother’s farm in Vonstown to help launch a hydroponics business in the newly converted barn.

At least, that’s what he said.

Was she sure of anything he told her over smothered, covered hash browns, hot, greasy bacon; and freshly baked waffles drowned in creamy butter and sticky syrup?

Lies covered in pearly-white smiles and long-lashed hazel irises.

Her first concern was born when he took the exit to Woodville. She started to guess he needed gas in the tank, but scrapped it as he plowed past three stations. The tires ate away at the lone road heading towards the mountains, and her anxiety grew with the miles.

David said it was just a shortcut from the east-west highway to the north-south route, circumventing the city. His lie was exposed as the balding radials crunched grovel in front of a sad-looking lodge where Lee might have billeted his regiment.

He said he was just stopping for directions.

If he knew the shortcut, why did he need directions?

She pinched the bridge of her nose to stave off the oncoming headache. Her blood sugar was probably dropping; coupled with the anxiety, and it was a roaring mix. Her eyes squeezed shut while her fingertips drew circles against her nasal cavity. Then, her world lurched.

It all became a blur of flailing arms and legs within a dark mass holding her down. Arms locked above her head, she kicked blindly.

She couldn’t breathe. Why couldn’t she breathe?

Looking down at the scuffle, she stood paralyzed, unable to help herself. Her body was swallowed by his bulk. His mouth shushed her to not fight back. Somehow, if she didn’t, it would all be better.

What did that mean?

More lies gussled up with sweet nothings.

He was full of crap.

She inhaled deeply; suddenly back under him, legs tried one last gambit jerking to and fro, finally finding paydirt. Satisfaction rushed over her like the welcome freedom it was as he clutched his wounded pride. Hands now free, they tore at his face as her mouth yelled her answer to everything being alright. The retort to the volleys was a strike to her face.

Tasting blood and dirt, the ringing sang her doom loud and clear. Her legs pulled by his strong arms, she tore into the dirt, scrambling for something. Anything. Broken fingernails found purchase and she turned to share it with him.

He was closer than she thought, and the sickening thud her filled first made never sounded so sweet. He went down like a marionette whose strings had been cut. After that, it was all a hazy, red blur.

Sometime later, she didn’t know when, she remembered cleaning up, gathering some food from the house into a sack and walking out. Alive; more than she could say for Waffle-boy.

That was miles ago.

Got to keep moving.

Unaware of where she was, there was no promised rescue. The mountains were ahead; the traphouse behind. A car’s gotta pass by soon, right?
