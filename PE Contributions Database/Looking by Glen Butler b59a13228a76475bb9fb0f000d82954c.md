***Looking* by Glen Butler**

I see you looking at me. Looking as if you know me, but you know nothing about me. But then, you have already judged me. And by your thinking, there is nothing more to know about me that you haven’t already judged. And yet you know nothing of me.

I’m alone, so I must be bad and up to no good. But then again; if I was with others like me, I would still be up to no good. I’m alone so I must be damaged goods; somehow I deserve to be in the situation that you currently think I’m in, homeless, with no one to love and care for me, and of no valuable use to anyone and a drain on society. I am an eyesore in the community and you wish that I would just go away.

If I told you that I had run away so that I could live a carefree life outside of the normal structure of society, it would strengthen your judgement of me. But if I told you that I ran away because I was being mistreated, beaten, and starved; would that make any difference in your judgement of me? Or what if all of my family had died in some horrific accident and I was the only survivor and had lost everything, would that affect your judgement? Would you want to help me then? What if I was thrown out of my home, or that it had burned down, would that change your judgement? What if I was old and feeble minded, had Alzheimer’s or dementia or some other main affecting disease. But society has taught us to assume the worst. What if I had just been out playing in the snow and was on my way home and stopped to look at you and wonder why you were out in the snow alone?

I see you looking at me, and that’s ok because I’m looking at you too. And it’s ok to wonder about a situation, but it is not ok to judge because you can never see all the facts. I am no less me just because I’m alone out in the snow. Am I now still me if my coat is not as clean or shiny as others? If you wonder if I’m cold, hungry, or in need of help? Ask, or offer help. It’s ok to look and wonder, but it is never ok to judge.
