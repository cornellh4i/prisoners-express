**“Blink of an Eye” By Matthew Ellington**

I’ve always marveled at how time, which is supposed to be one of the universe's immutable and unstoppable forces, can be viewed as a relative thing. It offers us the illusion of veracity and yet, time and time again, we find that it is an unstable truth which seems to fit itself into whatever framework of reality we would demand it to.

Look at the history of human civilization- some 10,000 years or so. Compare that to the broad stroke of the universe’s own existence- 13.8 billion years, and what do you have? Condense that into a single 24-hour period, and humanity- all we’ve discovered, achieved, won, lost, built, destroyed, become, and tried to overcome- would pass by in the blink of an eye.

Now this example aggravates the distorting lens of time to a degree, but I insist that in a similar way, we subvert our perception of time on a personal level every day- both in respect to the past and to our present as it trickles forward into the future. The only difference is one of scale and, in our instinctually egocentric way of viewing the world, usually one of proportion. At least this has usually been my existence.

Looking back at my own life now, after 27 years of hard fought ground won on the battlefield of life, I often reflect on how quickly it seems to have passed and how much I seem to have taken for granted. Of course, the major milestones play in my mind- high school graduation, boot camp graduation, my mother’s passing, marriage (and later divorce), as well as become both an adoptive and then a biological parent. However, what plagues me as I get older are the minor moments of seeming insignificance, the effect instances where, at the time, one can believe that time has stopped and will never start again. ONe of these moments irreversibly changed my life over 2 years ago- a period that exists simultaneously as a lifetime and a microcosm of space-time.

The initial accident happened so fast, I still have trouble pinpointing it to a single period of time. Between hearing the bookshelf crash as I sat on my porch with a cigarette to perform CPR on my 3-year-old son, I could never begin to discern where everything in my life fell apart. In contrast, the 3 days that followed, watching my heart break as he struggled on life support, only to slip quietly away, represents an epoch in my life unmatched by any other from my birth to now. Indeed, it is a moment that much extends until the last of my days, as it has never ended in my mind since and seems reluctant to do so.

As I sit in a 10x6 cell now, part of a world that for over 2 years now has been reticent to accept the ever present passage of time, I’m also peripherally aware of a sense of life passing by at its usually effervescent pace. It seems that while individual events may suspend us in here, and now like the tar pits of ages part, the overall tempo of our existence- both individually and as a whole, cannot be so easily mired. It is this awareness of time’s dichotomous nature that has helped me gain clarity into a simple truth- that although life has its ups and downs, you can stand resolute in the certainty that tomorrow is another day, another cycle of moments with the potential to bring us down or build us up, and while it isn’t promised (for no man can known when his day is come), what you can be sure of is that it’s passing will one day reflect but an instant in existence- the blink of an eye.
