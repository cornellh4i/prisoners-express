By Clarence Whitaker-Jones

When life gives you temporary pleasures, make long term benefits instead

When life gives you enemies, make God your priority to protect you

When life gives you drama, make your thoughts think about those who had it worse (Jackie Robinson, Malcolm X, MoLok, all of the prophets and messengers, your mom, ugly people, disabled people) and overcame their troubles

When life gives you vegetables, make sure you pray over your food

When life gives you difficulties with questions, make people give you a helping hand for easy answers

When life gives you a beautiful woman, make sure her mind is intelligent enough to keep you stimulated in areas of the unknown to you

When life gives you kids, make prayer thankful to God for them not coming out mentally or physically disabled

When life gives you blessings, make sure you share the gift for good memories

When life gives you near death experiences, make sure you realize you were thanking God

You didn’t die in a hellish mindstate but a peaceful one to come

When life gives you negativity, make sure you avoid or ignore those people, places and things

When life gives you a good night sleep, make sure you tired yourself out for another good night sleep

When life gives you prison, make sure you take advantage of the free; trade, schooling for your diploma, the gym, time to network with people who can help you succeed, the library, law library, food to share because you don’t want it, read to your kids video, educational events (motivational speaker, victim awareness day, etc.) time, correspondence services that are dedicated to prisoners resources, envelopes to tell family and friends you love them and motivate them to do better if they’re already satisfied with good.
