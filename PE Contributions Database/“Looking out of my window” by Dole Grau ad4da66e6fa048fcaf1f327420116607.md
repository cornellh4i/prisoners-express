**“Looking out of my window” by Dole Grau**

Here I am going through the walks of my life and adapting to the world around me.

I come to rest for a bit, and I sit on my window ledge looking out at the hustle and bustle of the rest of the people all going somewhere they need to be. I reflect on the movement of others and all the lives that are independently moving to form one big mass of people, all a part of something but maybe not together.

I sit on my window ledge and watch the people going around and think of myself as one of those people once moving in rhythm with them in a world of bodies.

So often we don’t take even the briefest of moments to stop, look, and listen to the world in which we live because we are so busy doing this or that and trying to keep ourselves afloat.

I dream of where I want to be or have memories of where I’ve been in the past, places where I want to reunite because of fond memories, but for now, here I am looking out my window.
