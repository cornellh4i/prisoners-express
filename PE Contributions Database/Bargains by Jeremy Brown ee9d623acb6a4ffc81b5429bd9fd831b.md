**Bargains by Jeremy Brown**

The question is, what exactly is a bargain? A bargain to me is getting what you want and allowing the others to get what they want. This time, for me, my bargain wasn’t material; it was infinitely more than that, and I will never forget about her, even though she did me wrong. The she is Kryslyn. With attraction, love, and sparks of energy, both of us got what we wanted, although it tore us to pieces.

You see, after my near death experience in 2009 and my job loss, I was unemployed and tired of living with my mom. So through Yahoo Messenger, I hooked up with this wonderful personality. Not only was she a ball of hot solar energy, she was kind and understanding. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend who was a crackhead and stole money from her to feed his unrelenting monkey.

So we had a deal. She works, and I stay home to clean, take care of the cat (I love cats--they’re funny creatures), and cook (yes I know how to cook). Oh did I mention I have to do the laundry, take out the trash, and go grocery shopping? No complaints. It was great. No arguments, casual lovemaking, and watching movies. Friday through Sunday I had to be job searching. That was a big joke. After 300 job applications, I froze and gave up. It’s weird. When I’m looking for work, there isn’t shit. When I’m not, opportunities are everywhere. I know I’m not the only person this happens to.

So after 1.5, I’m still living with her, but things aren’t going so smooth. The first red flag goes up when she starts having pot parties and hides me from her friends, or blatantly ignores my affectionate caresses. So I was taken aback: why was she doing this? Is she ashamed of my not having a job, or is she shy, or did I do something wrong? A week goes by, and the second red flag rises. “Baby, I need you to go to the store and get some cranberry juice, vitamin C, etc.,” Kryslyn said.

I said, “Why, do you have a UTI or something?”

“Yes I do.”

“Well how did that happen? I mean, we both are clean and take showers before and after we make love.”

She wouldn’t answer me. Later on that night, I had my suspicious. I hacked her Blackberry while she was in the shower. She never cleaned her phone out like I did. She always said I was paranoid. I constantly deleted messages. She had 1,000 texts saved for the past month. I guess I hit the Jackpot. One of the messages said, “I love you.” It was her friend named Stephen. On closer inspection, the messages that said I love you were on Fridays and Saturdays when I’m out looking for work. “Son of the whore of Babylon. This bitch did not just play me.”

I still had nowhere to go, and so I had to figure out plan B. I kept doing housework, catering to her and giving her daily (yes daily) backrubs and foot massages. It took me a week to figure out where I was going to live, work, eat, and sleep. Under pressure with nothing to lose, I feel my instincts kick in. It’s survival time now. I’m a very good woodsman and survivalist, and I don’t get lost. I basically found a 2-acre vacant lot full of trees in a rich neighborhood, set up camp, and made my way to the beach where all the tourists are. I left before her, packed my shit, put it on the porch, and waited until she came home. “Where are you going?”

“Have fun with Stephen…”

**Bargains 2 by Jeremy Brown**

As far as bargains go, the best bargain I found was on Craigslist in 2010, before I was incarcerated. I had to paint this doctor’s house and in return I got 2 huge 50-inch flatscreen TVs. I wasn’t doing it alone. I brought my 2 brothers and sisters along and we had a wonderful time just painting and joking around. Well the Tv’s had a bulb missing in each of them or the bulb was burnt out so we just ordered 2 $8 bulbs. 6 months later both TVs broke and we got rid of them. They were old big and bulky flatscreens, each weighing about 100 pounds. I guess it was worth it. SOmetimes you’ve got to take a risk.
