**Gratitude by John Naylor**

I wasn’t at PCF long before a trend seemed to start. To this day I can’t be sure where it started. It’s the simple phrase “gratitude.” You may answer what time it is when someone asks. Offer a soup, cup of coffee, or hold a door and you hear that phrase. Growing up in the central Indiana landscape I’d never heard it used in such a way. We’d normally hear “thank you”, “thanks”, or “right on.” I am glad that in a culture of decaying ethical and moral standards someone in such a place as a prison started this trend. Convict code is essentially dead here at PCF. The phrase has become a way to manipulate others to one’s agenda with requests and actions that are entirely one-sided. If it only makes a difference in one man, it makes a difference. So from those of us who still care, thank you.
