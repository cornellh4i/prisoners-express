**That “Feeling” by Thomas Combs**

I used to consistently have an argument with myself to go through with “it”. Everyday I would battle against my conscience and think, everyone has abandoned me other than my extremely elderly parents. The baby of 5 children that took until he was 35 to learn from his mistakes. I had plenty of good Arguments to support that only two people would attend my funeral but what if I continued on? May because I was a rebel who always went against the grain, no matter what the situation.

As I sit in this timeless void I now know as life. Where misery and monotony have become inseparably intertwined. All the hopes and dreams I used to possess have silently drained away, like an abscess by the punishment of my present condition. Each day is a constant argument between my fearful self to just end it all as opposed to proving to everyone I can be of use and not a waste of breath. All my memories of freedom, light, and beauty have faded and nearly unattainable to my conscious self surrounded by the atmosphere of this accursed place known as my temporary abode.

I thought that that feeling known as “depression” would be shakespearean, like sitting in a rocking chair and not being able to make it move. I thought it would descend over me like a fog, turning things foggy, and fuzzy and rendering all things gray. But depression is active, like a nervous worry-wart pacing back and forth wringing his hands. I couldn’t overcome the constant battering feud between going on or taking the easy route. I couldn’t stop thinking, nor could I find my way free of the apprehension. It made me feel like I was swimming through an endless jungle of seaweed. I felt like my pockets were filling with stones; growing heavier and heavier, sinking. People often asked if suicidal thoughts ever entered my thoughts. The answer is yes, of course, but the constant argument and battle between my want to just escape the constant ridiculing of my useless, meaningless, excuse of a living thing made me not have the energy to go through with it. After completing 7 years of my 9 and 1/4th year sentence with only 12 months remaining it’s said that I had regressed to this constant argumentative state rendering myself doomed, to sit, mute and worthless, not even able to be successful at the easiness of escape.
