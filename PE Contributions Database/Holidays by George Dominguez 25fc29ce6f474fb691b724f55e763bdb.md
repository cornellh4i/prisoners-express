**"Holidays" by George Dominguez**

I love and enjoy Thanksgiving because I love to eat turkey, ham, potato salad, boiled eggs, sausage, or hotlinks, black olives, jalapeno peppers with real butter biscuits, and all kinds of yummy desserts. I always liked watching my mom prepare the turkey and having my sisters help out, even though they were young. Sometimes we would go to our uncle’s. He lived not too far from us. I would spend Thanksgiving with them in Lubbock or go to Abernathy. We would all be listening to the elders talk about their times, laughing, drinking beer while the mothers are inside getting things ready. Sometimes we, the guys, went outside playing football and having friends over smoking pot, drinking beer--oh no, not around our house because that’s a no-no.

Sometimes I would go over to my girlfriend’s house and spend either Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner with them, or she with my family. Now on Christmas we would all pitch in and help make tamales. Yea, we would have turkey and ham, black eyed peas (which I don’t care for), and just about the same thing that we had for Thanksgiving. We would prepare the Christmas tree, but it would be a real christmas tree. Then we would be putting all the presents under the tree. On Christmas Eve we get to open just one present. Well I’m not like all my family who are into sports that they like watching during the holidays. My teams are and always will be: The Rams, 49er’s, and the Cardinals. I remember I was about 7 years old and my dad bought me a jean jacket that was grey on Christmas, and I drew the Ram on the back of my jacket, and he bought me the whole uniform of the Cardinals, and I had a sticker of the 49ers on my bike. Now, that’s one holiday I’ll never forget.

Good-old-holidays.
