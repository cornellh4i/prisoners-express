"Burned" by Johnathon McGeoch

She laid on the park bench, staring at her hand. The scar was beginning to fade on her knuckles, but it would never fade in her mind. Candace would never forget that one night as long as she lived. The memories, the pain-etched into the very core of who she was becoming.

Her picturesque innocence-shattered like a glass coffin in the middle of the den. Her entire concept of home-extinguished in the blink of an eye. Her ability to trust another person will never be rebuilt. Candaceâ€™s ability to trust herself is even more tenuous than anything else.

And so, as Candace stares at her fading hand, she takes another drag of smoke, pulling it deep into her lungs, imagining the scarring and build-up accumulating in her lungs, one puff at a time. She never smoked before-she never stops now. And she always stares at that scar-remembers that moment. She does not want to forgive; she will not allow herself to forget.

Every night she finds another bench, another back alley, under a different bridge. She hopes they never manage to find her; she is hiding more from herself than she is from them.

She begins to wonder as she stares, she puffs, she watches the scar fade right before her very eyes. She wonders to herself, what will happen if the scar completely fades away? Will she finally find peace? Or will she simply bum her next cigarette?
