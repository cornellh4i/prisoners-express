**“Girlfriend” by Efren Hawkins**

How is that we have the same thing we are looking for already in our grasp? Yeah, that is what this picture hits me with. Oh, I plead guilty because I’ve done it a million times. Let’s look at it like this, how is that we always want to go to a bigger party, when the small party was just as much fun, and it cost you less and you partied longer?

You also can take this as looking back at the past. Sometimes when you look back, you get stuck in the past. You get to understand that your future maybe is within arm's reach. So, let's move on, because the past is behind and the future is ahead. Keep yourself moving ahead, before you get left behind. It’s a new year with a lot to look forward to. Don’t get caught looking back because you might miss what’s ahead of you.
