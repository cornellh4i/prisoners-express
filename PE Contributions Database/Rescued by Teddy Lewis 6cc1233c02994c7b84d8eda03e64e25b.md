**Rescued by Teddy Lewis**

I wondered had I not gotten arrested and sentenced to 21 years could my spirit still exist… I'm 52 and proud yet now I look at life in grand fashion. It’s like all the things I sought are meaningless without understanding. It’s like state prison, despite the misery and all its counterparts, can’t hide the mystery of being reserved during the time of “hell in Harlem.” I remember the wind and crazy moments of ‘94, and the summer of ‘97 and 2002 and 2003… perhaps the outcome of being rescued is science, but regardless to it I need to capitalise on life and my surviving through tragedy and need. I take responsibility for the sudden mistake, yet to be ‘rescued’ means I have another chance and this time I’m serious.
