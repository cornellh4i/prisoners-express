***Milestones* by Brandon Rushing**

****Jake comes outside early on Saturday morning to get his newspaper off the drive and sees his son come trudging up the road in a pair of his steel-toe work boots. Curious, he walks over beside the road and waits for the boy to arrive.

“What are you doing, Kevin?” The man asks his eight year old son.

“I heard grampa tell Uncle Mike that if he had ever walked a mile in his shoes, Uncle Mike could have had anything he ever wanted,” Kevin replies breathlessly.

“So what has that got to do with your being out here in my work boots?” The boy’s father inquires sheepishly, still unsure what his child is up to.

“Well, I thought that if maybe I could walk a mile in grampa’s shoes, I could have anything I want too!” Kevin replies in earnest, as though the answer was obvious.

“Son, those are my shoes, not grampa’s.” Jake points out to his boy.

“I know that, dad!” The boy responds with sarcasm in his voice. “Grampa’s shoes are much bigger!” Kevin finishes, as he hands his father’s boots back to him and walks away.
