**Nourishment by Matt Ondreako**

The DOC has the kitchen put out a menu every week. At times we do not even get what food it says. They give us whatever they want. There are times they under-cook the food or even over-cook it.

Last week the kitchen ran out of the pork they had for everyone. Our block had gone up to eat. We got sausage, but it was ice cold and uncooked.

That is very unhealthy. Yet they still gave it to us. Each day goes by, and they continue to get away with it. When us inmates do complain about it, they always find a way to cover themselves.

When we do get what we should be getting, it is very unhealthy for us to eat. They get the food from a company called Airmart.

It may be precooked once they get it, but once us inmates get it it is ice cold and we are getting rushed eating it.

I would complain about it. It would do no good. They would only cover for themselves or have others cover for them.
