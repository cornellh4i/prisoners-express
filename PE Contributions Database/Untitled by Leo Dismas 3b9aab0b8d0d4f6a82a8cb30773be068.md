Approximately three months into my detention at Cook County Jail I had an epiphany - I wasn’t a very good dog owner.

By then, I had already decided I would never again visit or support any organization that kept animals in captivity - shelters being the only exception. I certainly would never again visit or support any zoo or Seaworld type establishment. I don’t think I was the exception, I would argue that most of my fellow inmates shared my sentiment. One needs only to experience, first-hand, the feeling of incarceration; the loss of freedom, of free will, of control, to truly empathize. I remember when I first arrived to jail and looked upon the rows of cells with their narrow feeding ports that I first felt like I had arrived at some surreal human zoo - and that feeling has grown stronger with every passing day. But, I digress…

On this particular day we were scheduled for our weekly “yard”. It looked like a nice spring day, and to be honest, I was quite looking forward to the idea of breathing some fresh air and getting some much needed sun. We weren’t out for more than a few minutes before we were directed to return to our decks and lock-up. Why? I have no idea. Presumably some fight on another deck which in turn “locked down” the facility. It seemed like such a tease. I was so excited to be going outside, I surely had a big grin and was joking with my fellow inmates--enjoying a brief moment of levity, but alas it was cut short by the “prison-life”. It was at that moment that I realized how my dog must have felt every time I came home from work and took him out for a walk that lasted no more time than was necessary to “do his business”. Often less than five minutes as the poor thing had been holding it in for 8-10 hours in his cage (cell). He, also, was so excited about the possibility of a nice walk outside, breathing some fresh air, getting some sun, and just spending time with his owner. But, I was too busy. I had to get back to my reality TV show, or get ready to go out (and again leave him locked-up for hours on end) or some other non-consequential need. I can count on one hand how many times over the past year I had taken him for a long walk or to the dog park or dog beach for an afternoon of fun..sad. I can now clearly remember his sad eyes every time I led him to his cage to be locked up. I’m sure he wondered what he had done wrong to deserve it. Nothing. He didn’t deserve it. He deserved a dog owner who prioritized his pet. One who spent time with him. Who exercised him consistently and made the time to play with him daily. He wasn’t a criminal- he had done nothing wrong and yet I had imprisoned him for my own selfish desires. I wish I could apologize to him now, to tell him how sorry I am and how I will spend the rest of his life making sure he never feels that sense of desperation that comes from being detained against your will.

One day I hope to become the man my dog thinks I am… I think there can be no greater aspiration for any dog owner.
