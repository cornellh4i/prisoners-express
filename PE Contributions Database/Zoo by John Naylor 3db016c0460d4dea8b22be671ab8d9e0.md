**Zoo by John Naylor**

I remember being puzzled at the monkeys in the Indianapolis zoo. They were the most uncivilized creatures there as I looked on in my youth. It was so bizarre my mom had to call me away. The penguins were my favorite at the time. Mom saw to it that I rode horses, camels, and elephants in my life. My dad especially wanted me to experience camels and elephants between the zoo and carnivals, He never took a turn though perhaps out of some manliness he was taught holding him back, reluctant to stand in line with children. So he never experienced an elephant vertebrae on his tailbone or how you could one up any cowboy on being a saddle sore. Though I was hesitant, perhaps out of shyness now I’m glad he had me experience it. They’re much different than riding a donkey. Outside of prison I’ve never seen any other creatures as rebellious and sexually abnormal and inappropriate as those monkeys. Though perhaps I should’ve been wondering how my brother and I never convinced bubblegum ice cream cones was something we must eat at the zoo. I went to my zoo on a field trip with Anderson Christian School. I fed goats, they had lemurs. Though it’s not in the indianapolis zoo’s league. As a child they gave me a uniform and made me a pygmy goat keeper. I later learned they charged my Mom for me to sweep manure. Hey, it went for a good cause though right? I liked it.
