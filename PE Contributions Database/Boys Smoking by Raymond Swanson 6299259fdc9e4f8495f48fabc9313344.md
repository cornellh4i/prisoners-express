**"Boys Smoking" by Raymond Swanson**

Let me tell you a story about three guys who used to think they were some real flyboys. These boys met the first day of school on the bus and realized they all lived in the same neighborhood. They began to play and ride bikes together every day, and the years flew by. Tommy, the guy on the left, was my best friend, and this one day, he shows up with a packet of cigarettes, and Bobby, on the right, a lighter. Bobby lit one and puffed away, and Tommy and I looked on cautiously.

“C’mon, Paul,” Bobby said, nudging my arm. “Don’t be scared.”

Well, of course I wasn’t going to be scared. Tommy held the camera in his right arm and snapped this picture, then threw the cig down. “Our moms will kill us,” he laughed.

I found this photograph twenty-two years after it was taken as I am preparing to drive home for Bobby’s wake. He never stopped smoking. I haven’t been back since Tom and I broke it off six years ago. Yet this morning, when he called to tell me and asked if I still had this photo, he said he was looking forward to seeing me again.

Bobby always had a way of bringing people together.
