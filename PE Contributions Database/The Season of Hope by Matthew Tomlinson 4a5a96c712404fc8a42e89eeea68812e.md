**The Season of Hope by Matthew Tomlinson**

Gary gave us “Accomplishments” for this June 01, 2017 theme. Prisoner Express will get this competition mailed out to you prior to the Christmas season. Christmas is called the season of hope. Here’s a story for my fellow coffee addicts. If you drink fewer than ten cups of coffee per day, then you won’t understand this tale as well as a brown-blooded coffee addict. Yet you can empathize. Santa Claus accomplished a miracle here in Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ). Grab a cup of the cheapest coffee you can get, maybe 85 cents per bag, and make 3 gallons. Then drink a toast to the miracle Santa Claus accomplished for me.

Yeah, they screwed me around in a left-handed sort of way. I was one of those Left-Handed Corkscrews. They had me comfortable perched in High Security C-Pod. Poor budgetary practices caused me to exhaust my coffee supply three days before commissary. The last cheap shot went down Sunday morning. Commissary day would be Wednesday. THat was no real problem. A stretch of coffee-deprived days in the windowless tomb world of high security would reinforce the need to allocate resources conservatively. That sounds good, then they moved me from High Security C-Pod to High Security A-Pod. The people on A-Pod had gone to the commissary the day before my arrival, so it was 13 days before commissary again. Two weeks of coffee denial loomed.

As we ride the downward spiral of the Left-Handed Corkscrew, we have to be wary of the perverts who purvey false hopes. It was 0530 hours on Friday. Commissary day was two full days away. The oncoming day shift guard yelled: “A-Pod! Listen up! That ditzy little dyke at the commissary changed the schedule! A-Pod is going to commissary today! Git yer lists ready to be picked up in ten minutes!” Oh yeah? Now how did this guad know what the Commissary Girl would do? She wouldn’t come to work until 0830 hours. Even then, the Commissary might be in Potter County Jail yet once more. So how would this guard know she was running A-Pod two days early? Talk about a christmas gift! They might run commissary one day early, or maybe two days. But eleven days early? The warden would do a table dance in Three Chow Hall, with pink panities and a rose in his butthole, on Christmas Day.

Then again, you have to balance what false hope costs. What was the worst they could possibly do? They would pick up commissary lists at 0630 hours. They might bring them back at 0930 hours lunchtime. So what? I knew the guard had been lying to taunt a coffee fiend. No skin off my back. The world is weird, though, and prison is even more so. Christmas Day was Monday. Maybe...just maybe...maybe I could drink a cup of coffee to toast Santa Clause. And so began the season of hope.

You have to learn the proper way to ride the pitch of that Left-Handed Corkscrew. The guard picked up commissary lists. There was nothing to do but wait. The best way to wait for Christmas Day is to go to bed early Christmas Eve and dream that Santa dropped a few bags of 85¢ coffee in your socks. Socks? Yeah, you aren’t likely to hang your stockings, huh? Hang your socks. You have no chimney. You have no windows in the Tomb World of High Security. Do whatever you can, with whatever you have, wherever you are, right now. Hang your socks by the vent in your cell as a token to your faith. Any 350-pound rascal who can fly a set of reindeer all over the world in one night...well, that rascal can put coffee in your socks. It’s the season of hope, y’know? Hang your socks. Santa Claus can accomplish his mission.

At 0930 hours they brought lunch trays. They didn’t return the commissary lists. The season of hope continued. Santa Claus might be loading his sleigh. Maybe...just maybe.

At 1410 hours they brought supper trays. Santa Claus did indeed accomplish his mission. Right behind the Chow Cart came the bedraggled Commissary Girl with her elfish-looking trusty's pulling commissary sled! It was the FRiday before the Christmas Holiday Weekend, yet the Commissary Girl accomplished the mission Santa Claus had delegated to her. It was 11 days before our scheduled turn for commissary, yet I was able to toast Santa with a cup of cheap coffee.

Don’t ask! Don’t ask what happened in Three Chow Hall!
