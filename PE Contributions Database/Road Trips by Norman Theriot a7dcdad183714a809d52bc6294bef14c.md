**"Road Trips" by Norman Theriot**

From my earliest recollection, road trips have always been enjoyable experiences for me. As a child, road trips provided me with the opportunity to be with my family, all of us together in a small area, experiencing what the countryside had to offer, and from time to time seeing something out of the ordinary.

In remembering these trips, I am brought back to a simpler time. At the time, I remember my father had a 1970 Plymouth Fury III. The car was as big as a tank. The dashboard was steel, no padded plastic, the seat belts were lap belts which no one ever used. We only had an AM radio.

I can remember riding, laying on the back dash waving to people, even cops. I was six or seven years old. Let a kid do that today, someoneâ€™s going to jail.

There was no navigation system, no cellphone or GPS; yet, we always ended up at our destination. Back then things were so much more simple, honest even. Life was better, less stressful.

Today our nation is encumbered by technology that is supposed to make life easier, it makes us lazier. We have so many laws that there is no longer true freedom.

Family get-togethers have been replaced with weekends working a second job just to make ends meet. Our children have become addicted to video games and computers. Social skills are not gained. Parents, for the most part, are never around for they are either working or sleeping. Our youth lacks guidance.

My last road trip was the Bluebird bound for where I am now, chained to someone else sitting on hard plastic seats seeing the world through perforations in stainless steel. This ended in a place of such desolation and absence of comfort.

My next road trip will be again on a Bluebird, again chained to someone only this time, heading toward freedom.
