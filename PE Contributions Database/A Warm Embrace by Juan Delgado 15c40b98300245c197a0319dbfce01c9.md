**A Warm Embrace by Juan Delgado**

That smile you shared

The fresh smell of your hair

At home is the best place

Nothing better than a mom’s warm embrace

The tender loving care

The knowledge that you will always be there

You’re my light to my darkness

The clarity to my judgment’s

The beat of your heart will

Always be embedded in my DNA

And as time fades away, I will

Always remember my mother’s

Warm embrace
