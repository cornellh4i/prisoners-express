“When life gives you Hell, make Heaven” by Raymond Springs II

Reader, there is an Ol’ Alsican saying that says: “Whenever you become consciously aware of any problem, it is you who are the solution.”

So when this world is hostile and cruel, and at times this is sure to be true, don’t make a bad time/experience worse than it already is by following your negative impulses. Instead, establish calmness and draw energies from within your inner-wale of peace, and focus on the supreme voice of Self, listen with the ears of eternity allowing you to gain from the ancient Wisdom of your four mothers, who we are all connected to through the active parts of our DNA, namely the human genome/mitochondria. Yes, I’m saying we all have cell level communications with our four mothers, yet most of us have never been taught the universal language on a level high enough so that we are able to comprehend the many voices screaming in our blood, in an attempt to be heard by their progeny.

For those of us who have undertaken initiation from either ancient or modern sacred schools, which are Metu Neter, Shetu Neter, Ausarian, Ausetin, 42 precepts of Maat, the 11 Laws of Maat, Sufism, Knights Templars, Prince Hall Kemetic Lodae, Kemetic/Hermetic Freemasonry, Moorish Science Temple of America, Sisterhood of the Eastern Star, Nation of Islam, or the ones I’m initiated in, namely the Nation of Gods and Earths, Kabbalah, Kybalon and the Golden Dawn. They all teach advanced forms of the universal language which is called Supreme Mathematics and Supreme/Divine Alphabet. This is the language of the human soul which is found within each cell of blood as the communicator between the four mothers and their representatives now, being you or myself in the present.

Now that I’ve provided you, the reader, with a brief esoteric education on this limited matter, I now can go on to convey the original and most important message: “When life gives you Hell, make Heaven!”

When life gives you Hell, make Heaven--what does this saying mean? My answer is simple in connection with what I’ve shared with you above. Life is the realm where the physical you exists on the level of mental awareness. Hell is a description of conditions presented in the physical, psychic, or emotional steps, stages, and degrees of the areas that are still learning and developing in one’s life. By listening to the parts of the Self that are eternal, therefore have always been, which is called the four mothers who speak in the language of Supreme Mathematics, the Hell you are aware of is communicated as an equation which is then scientifically broken down by the mind and solved through the actions of the person working the Divine equation, the sum of every equation worked through as instructed by the four mothers is Heaven on Earth, or Paradise with ones Earth/God.

Understanding that Hell is described as a pit because when someone is in Hell, it’s because they’ve allowed their base/animal nature to lord over the logical/mental Higher self which is always in the realms of Heaven which is the Paradise we are able to create through the execution of Supreme Mathematics which is to learn how to communicate on the cellular level with the four mothers who regulate our life force and the life force of this Planet, Earth.
