**“Thankful in the Valley” by D. Spencer**

The young, dark-haired, bright-eyed girl clung to the man’s hand. They struggled to walk through the valley. Thick trees and fallen limbs attempted to block every step they took, and they struggled on.

“Why won’t you let go of my hand,” the girl asked, as she looked up into the incredibly beautiful man’s face.

“I don’t want you to get hurt,” he simply stated.

Ever inquisitive, the child continued, “But why?”

Holding her hand tighter, he responded just as simply, “Because I love you. I want to protect you. It’s my responsibility.” The unlikely duo continued on.

The small girl, becoming weary after a time, began to complain, “Why do we have to go through the valley? Why do we have to go through the hard parts? I’m getting tired, and I’m hungry.”

The man looked lovingly upon her and reached out his hand toward her, “Here. I have some fruit for you to eat; it will fill you an give you strength.” The girl quickly took the fruit and began to devour it. “Don’t eat it so quickly,” the man advised. “Take your time and savor it, one bite at a time… Enjoy it as the gift that it is.” The girl looked up with gratitude for this man...but also with confusion. He wasn’t eating. He had to be hungry and tired, too. Why would he give her the only food that he had? Her hunger overcame her curiosity and confusion, and she quickly focused her thoughts back on the delicious fruit. With a meaningful, yet quick “thank you,” the child placed her hand back in his, and they continued on their path.

Before long, the girl began to complain again. “I’m not hungry anymore, but I am tired,” she whined. With no thought to himself or to his trouble along the hard journey, the man lifted the girl into his arms and began to carry her. She was almost too amazed to speak! No one had ever lifted and carried her in this way before No one had ever taken her burdens and placed them on their own back. This must be a really good man that found her lost in the wilderness. She nestled into his arms and again, meaningfully yet quickly, offered a simple “thank you.”

The young girl drifted off in her rescuer’s strong arms, somehow certain that she was safe and that he was indeed strong enough to carry her safely through the valley. As dark began to creep upon them, she quickly woke, fearful of the night sky pressing down upon them. She too quickly forgot the assurance and comfort he offered her. Knowing her thoughts before she spoke them, the man asked, “Is something wrong?”

Shivering against him, she whispered, “I’m afraid.”

The man pulled her closer to him and softly spoke, “What is it that you are afraid of, child?”

Clinging tightly, the girl began a long list of her fears, “I’m afraid of the dark. And the animals that come out at night. And the night bugs. And being alone. Most of all, I’m afraid that you will get tired and leave me here by myself.”

Stopping, the man sat down and held the girl tightly in his lap. He lovingly caressed her hair as he softly spoke, “Listen to me, child. We need the dark. We need the night sky so that we can enjoy the millions of beautiful stars above. Do you see them? Each one has a place of its own in the heavens above. And why fear the animals? They are only doing what they were created and designed to do. They come out at night with a purpose, child. And as for me, I will never leave you. I will never forsake you. You will never be lost and left alone in the wilderness so long as you continue to cling and cleave to me.”

The man rose, continuing to carry the girl. With her fears seemingly at rest once more, they began on their way again. The pair travelled for many days and nights before they finally made it through the valley and up onto a beautiful mountain top. The view was glorious! The young girl looked around and saw beauty like she had never seen before. Saw it in a new way, with a clean and fresh vision. She saw that her destination was just a short ways ahead, and she began to run. Just as quickly as she began, se stopped and spun around, seeking her rescuer’s face. “Aren’t you coming with me? Don’t you want us to stay together?”

Walking slowly toward her, the man reached out his hand and took her’s once more in his as he explained, “My child, I have always been and always will be with you. You are my child, and I am your Father. In the valley, on the mountain, and every place in between, I am with you. Even when you can’t see me, I am with you. Remember to cling to me, listen to my voice, and know that I am the Lord, your God. I will never leave or forsake you. Those words I spoke to you were true in the valley, and they will always be true.” As the Savior released her hand, she felt tears of true and deep love and gratitude spill from her eyes. She knew what He said was true. She had never been alone, and she never would be. Meaningfully, with all of her heart, mind, and soul, she smiled and whispered, “Thank you.”
