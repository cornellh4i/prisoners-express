**“In the Wastelands” by Thomas Soria**

In the deserted wastelands on the planet Altara, most of the inhabitants could care less about anyone but themselves. However, there was one man who saw the lawlessness as an afront. While often called a vigilante, he didn’t see it that way. There wasn’t anyone else willing to be the law but somebody needed to.

Nobody knew who he was or why he did it. You might think that there had been some tragedy in his life, perhaps when he was younger, that set him on this course, but you’d be wrong. He was driven by a sense of justice, and the lack thereof, in the wastelands.

Even those to whom he dispensed justice, he didn’t kill, unless it was the only option. He “escorted” them to a legal authority. To him, even they deserved fair treatment.

In his years of service he saved hundreds of travelers from all sorts of criminals. This is an account of one act of justice he performed.

The Jones family had decided to vacation on Altara and visit the wastelands. John, the father, had convinced Linda, his wife and mother to baby June and their twins Lindsey and Hank, that the rumors were just hype: “No authority could allow such an unwholesome way of life to exist in this age.” Little did he know of the truth.

Now you might wonder what a “wasteland” would have to offer to a vacationing family but it really is a splendid and beautiful environment to visit. Just like Death Valley in Nevada and the Utah badlands back on Earth, extreme places can have great beauty. Sitting in the Elder hot springs at night while Altara’s two moons light the sky is exquisite.

When the assault happened, the Jones family had been in the wastelands for just over a week, local time. Most assaults happen around this time frame, and they didn’t realize they were being watched for days before the thugs approached them while the Jones ate lunch.

There were four of them in all. They were a greasy but wiry looking lot. It was a weariness that carried strength despite a lack of large muscle. There was an almost feral intensity to their eyes, and they had a dangerous and lustful look as they gazed at the nervous family.

“What are you doing there?” the blond thug asked with a sneer.

“We’re… we’re travelling to the hot springs,” responded John.

“Mmm… what a beautiful family you have, the black-haired thug said, disconcertingly. All the while, they had inched closer to the family, and this is when they attacked. The poor Jones family, in their fear and nervousness, didn’t even see it coming, not that they could have done much. John was a computer technician and spent most of his time at a desk. Linda was a housewife, and the twins were barely 15 and unaccustomed to any violence.

The black-haired thug did a quick move up to John and gave him a vicious backhand to the face, sending him sprawling into the dirt. The blonde sprinted over and grabbed Lindsey with a knife in his hand.

“No!” Linda yelled as she tried to run for Lindsey. Unfortunately, the thug with piercing green eyes intercepted her with a knife in hand.

“I wouldn’t do that,” he smiled. “I might have to use this,” he noted as he brandished the knife.

Meanwhile, the last thug, the stern faced one who was obviously the leader, stood back and watched. He produced a pistol once the melee started, and once the situation was under control, he flashed a smirk. His dead eyes never showed any emotion.

This is when the shot rang out, except it wasn’t stern face who’d done the shooting. It was his chest that erupted in blood as he collapsed to the ground. It was the beginning of the thugs’ end, even though they hadn’t quite realized it yet.

“Step away from that family or follow his lead.” It was a hard-edged voice that carried authority and violent experience. The man behind the voice seemed to rise up out of the ground. He held a rifle, and even as he moved it was rock steady on each thug in turn.

You could tell his clothing was meant to blend into the environment. It was all utilitarian too. He had a sidearm at his belt and extra clips and rounds in his vest. He had sandy brown hair and slate gray eyes that never ceased moving and assessing. Every move was precise and calculated.

The thugs were nervous and uncertain now. The weasel-like calculations were going on behind their eyes. The blond thug was trying to move more behind Lindsey, hoping not to be a rifle target. The green-eyed thug backed away from Linda who sank to her knees, wracked by sobs, while the black-haired one stood confused in front of John with his hands at his sides.

Then, the blonde, trying to adjust his position, moved the knife from Lindsey’s neck. In that instant, he took a bullet to the shoulder and dropped to the ground in agony.

“On the ground, the rest of you,” came that authoritative voice. Realizing what had happened and scared of the rifle, the other two complied. They knew who this man was: he was legend and anathema to their kind. It was over.

He escorted the family to safety, and the thugs to jail. He buried their leader. The jones offered much to him, and he accepted nothing more than their thanks.
