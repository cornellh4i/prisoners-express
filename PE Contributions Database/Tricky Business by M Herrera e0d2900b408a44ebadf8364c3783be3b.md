**Tricky Business by M. Herrera**

Being here in the system, seems there’s always Tricky Business going on. And why me? Because I’m trustworthy, that’s it. Period. I’m also frugal. I’ve learned to set boundaries, although very generous. Crazy right? Not…. There are those who need, there are those who want. I never realized everyone -everyone- on the planet has some sort of criminal Tricky Business-tendencies. A shame us humans are, or should be ashamed of ourselves. The correctional systems are either trying to teach us to stop or do not trade. Oops, Barter!! Two (2) reasons. (1) one: If we were in the frug world we did a lot of trading - er, bartering. (2) Two: knowing we thrive on this Tricky Business, it’s a control or correctional thing. Guess what? They do it too. Have you ever heard of yard sales? Buying or selling homes? On and On etc. , etc. duh, I’m in a tricky business system, I must do as told. Do not trade or barter. Dumb ass. Games is not on here. This is time for correction. No tricky business shall be done. I have a new name for it, trading, bartering. Tricky businessing. Moral of this story?: Don’t do the crime If you can’t do the time. You don’t want or need to end up doing tricky business. Right?
