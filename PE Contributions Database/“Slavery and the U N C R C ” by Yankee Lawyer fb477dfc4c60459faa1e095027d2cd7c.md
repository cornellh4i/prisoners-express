**“Slavery and the U.N.C.R.C.” by Yankee Lawyer**

The U.S.A. is the world’s leading consumer of pornography. That doesn’t hurt the balance of trade, thought, because it’s also the leading producer.

It’s easy to hire actors and fluff boys here. The U.S.A. is the only developed country in the world that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the second most ratified treaty in the world, behind the U.N. Charter itself. It’s sort of a BIll of Rights for children. It’s not a very long or complicated document. It focuses on one right, arguably the basic right of childhood: the right to the care and protection of one’s family. It simply prohibits taking a child from his parents without due process of the law.

My three children were about the same age as those two playing in the street outside the station- the boy and the other one in their nylon tights, both holding their chains- when Pamela snatched them. Two girls and a boy they were, all intelligent, good looking and very valuable. Her boyfriend bragged about the movies they made. My children laughed and cried on cue. Their tears were real.

Pamela and Clarence treated my children as chattel property. DSS and the city police formed a joint task force and awarded sole custody to my children’s captor.

“What?” you might ask. “Didn’t the boy show the judge his scars? Didn’t the older girl tell him what happened to the token of her virginity?”

No. Despite the clear mandates of the North Carolina General Statutes, the children weren’t allowed to testify; they weren’t present in court (the subpoenas were ignored); they probably didn’t know what was going on. The State’s antebellum case law is clear: slaves have no standing in court and remember, the U.S.A. is the only developed country on Earth that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
