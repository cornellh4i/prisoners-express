**"Holidays" by Hernandez Cesar**

I hate the holidays. I never liked them, and I never will. Growing up we celebrated Thanksgiving with richer food than at Christmas. I remember one year in particular when mom made a feast that was three times as huge as normal. It was my uncle’s first Thanksgiving in the United States. I still think that mom wanted to show off slightly and impress him. I can’t even remember what mom made, but she made everything. Our dining table is a fairly good size, capable of seating twelve people. It was completely full of food. After the “first course,” the table was cleared. Whole new food was brought out for the “second course,” and once again it completely filled the table. I completely pigged out. It got to the point where I had to throw up, and throw up I did. So basically I was back to zero and had eaten nothing. The table was cleared for the “third course.” It was completely filled with desserts. I pigged out since I had “eaten” nothing. That year, my Thanksgiving meal that I digested was all desserts. It was also the first Thanksgiving that my wife spent with my family. A month later, at her family’s for Christmas, the meal looked like crumbs compared to what my family had done for Thanksgiving.

I dreaded Christmas. I knew that my sister would wake me and everyone else up at about 5 AM. Dad would tell her that we would not open the Christmas presents until 6 AM. I, like most Americans, would charge my American Express cards more than I should. I would always try to buy cool things. Usually, I got the feeling that my gifts were not very appreciated, especially by my dad. I would always try to buy my dad stuff, and he would always either break it or lose it. I once bought him an expensive watch, and he broke it at work the first time he actually wore it. I bought him expensive sunglasses, and he said a gust of wind blew them out of the truck. I bought him expensive cologne, and he said it fell out of the door pocket in the truck. The only thing he did actually love and use was the expensive robe and slippers I bought him. He actually did use those all the time.

Dad always had his same exact Christmas speech. I didn’t pay attention, but it was basically that he didn’t buy us any Christmas presents but still loved us. It was the same speech every year.

Breakfast was not too bad. It was always the same every year. There was a bakery less than five minutes away. We would buy one gallon of Menudo, two pounds of beef barbecue, two pounds of goat barbecue, and about twenty pieces of all different kinds of sweetbreads.

After breakfast, Christmas was over. Everyone would go to their own corner of the house and spend the rest of the day by themselves.
