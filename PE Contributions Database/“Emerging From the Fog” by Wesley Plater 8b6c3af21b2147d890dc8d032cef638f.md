**“Emerging From the Fog” by Wesley Plater**

A ghost emerges from the fog; tattered and battered from the fights, he struggles for survival, he covers his scars, to not scare the public. He’s ashamed of his past, but can’t confide in a friend as they were all crooks and backstabbers. In the end, he drifts through the secrets not knowing where to go. As he’s lost everything, he knows he can’t wallow in sorrow, he’s made it through hell. He can’t look back as every day demons are following, waiting for him to slip so they can drag him back down. He holds his head high with a confident stride, and now his family can see him emerging from the fog waiting in the sunshine, his life begins anew.
