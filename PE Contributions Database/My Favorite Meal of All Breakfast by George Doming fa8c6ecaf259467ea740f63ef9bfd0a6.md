**"My Favorite Meal of All: Breakfast" by George Dominguez**

I remember as a little kid- I would always wake up finding my mom in the kitchen. After my dad goes to work, my mom would always be making dough, and she would roll them out flat almost as if she was making tortillas. But then, she would cut them into strips with a knife and put them in a pan with oil. Then when they are done, she would place them on a plate and cover it with sugar on both sides after letting them cool down. Man! I truly miss that a lot. Sometimes, she would tell my dad before he headed to work if he would go to the backer and get some sweet bread. Other times, she would make us some rancheros, huevo con salchicha (sausage and eggs). Both our parents knew their way around the kitchen and at a young age, my mom taught us how to cook for ourselves. The mean meal "breakfast" I crave the most is just tamales, eggs, refried beans, and some jalapenos. But I just couldnâ€™t get my pica de gallo the way my mom could, HOT, and I mean real HOT and spicy. I also remember my dad taking us to this place called Furrs Cateteria in Lubbock and in San Antonio, this Mexican restaurant, I'm not sure if it's still there since I haven't been in San Antonio for about 43 years. From what some of my friends have told me, San Antonio has changed a lot.
