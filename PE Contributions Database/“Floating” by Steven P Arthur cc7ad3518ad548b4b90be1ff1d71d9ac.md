**“Floating” by Steven P. Arthur**

It’s a reoccurring dream. I’m falling, the dry wind whips past me. I look around and see nothing but the darkening blue sky and the setting sun. Even below me there is nothing. Just more sky. I feel no sense of impending doom. I’m falling toward nothing, not the ground, I’m just falling. Time passes and I continue to fall. Minutes stretch into hours and days into weeks. I just fall. The setting sun stays setting. It becomes neither darker nor lighter. If not for the wind jostling me around, whipping my hair and clothes around, I would say I’m paused. Like a movie waiting to be restarted. I am fully clothed: shoes, socks, pants and shirt. But, I have no parachute; my fall is not a jump. There is no fear, I continue to fall. I turn, twist, fly like a bird, and roll over. But, nothing changes. I have no control, but of my own body and thoughts. I close my eyes and let go.
