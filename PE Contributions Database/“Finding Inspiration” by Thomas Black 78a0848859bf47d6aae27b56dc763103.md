**“Finding Inspiration” by Thomas Black**

What a coincidence, while seeking inspiration to write about my lack of inspiration, I decided to dig out my P.E. Summer Newsletter and see if it would perhaps provide a spark. To my surprise, in Upcoming Theme Topics was Finding Inspiration. I had found the jumpstart I needed.

Let me further explain. For a considerable time I’ve wanted to write about how this “system has affected me.” Several times I’ve wanted to pick up a pen and say how I felt, but I just couldn’t bring myself to begin.

Then I realized six years of this existence has taken my inspiration little by little. I have so many ideas I’d like to express, things worthy of being said! Good ideas, ways to improve this system. Things that could improve lives and help, really help! But I’m to a point where I feel, what’s the use? No one will listen to me anyway. And so I write nothing, feeling depleted and defeated about my lack of motivation. It seems like there’s no reason to make an effort to say what I wish to say.

I loathe to think this way! My thinking tells me, each day I sit idle, people are lost who could be saved. And because of my inactivity, many lives are being squandered, and I’m responsible. It’s a heavy burden to carry.
