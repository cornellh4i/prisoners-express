**Rescued by Richard Schmidlkofer**

I have 2 rescues in my life, physical and spiritual. The first one is physical.

I was born on January 28th, 1972. I had a troubled childhood. I was a wild child, my parents could not control my anger/rage temper. My mother was a stay at home mom/wife. She was scared of me, but she still loved me. My dad worked at a paper mill. He drank, looked at porn, and disciplined. I was also addicted to these sexual material at age 5-6 years old and found it in parent’s bedroom. Every time I got in trouble he beat me naked. This went on until the age 11-12 years old. The state rescued me first and sent me to a psych ward in a hospital for 3 months.

I went to a foster home with 2 foster brothers and 1 foster sister. 1 of my foster brothers was a couple years younger. I stay with this family for 7 years.

The rescued helped me with my anger/rage. I still need rescue of my sexual addiction. I’m doing Bible studies on that topic.

The 2nd rescued was when I was 20 years old on January 1992. I was in an apartment run by Lutheran social service. The staff members were Christian, I was an unbeliever. She wanted me to go to this Christian concert. I told her why should I go. My grandfather just died. Where is your God? Why would God kill my grandfather. She kept on asking so I gave in. That was the day God rescued my soul. When I accepted Jesus as my personal saver. This is the best rescue of my life from the lake of fire. I now have eternal life with Jesus. Praise God!
