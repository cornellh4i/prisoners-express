**“The Fox and the Egg” by Franklin Lee**

Just past the Miller’s farmhouse, on the edge of a small forest, lived Mr. and Mrs. Fox. The Foxes, with their lush red fur and little black paws, got along quite well with their closest neighbors. Farmer Miller, his wife, and two young daughters, were delightfully content with the wildlife near the farm. Every night, they would leave out scraps for Mr. and Mrs. Fox. While Mrs. Fox was satisfied with the scraps, Mr. Fox had secretly wanted more.

“What else would you want?” asked Mrs. Fox one night, gnawing on a leaf of tossed lettuce. “We have everything we need. Good food, good neighbors…”

But Mr. Fox was not satisfied. One night, while Mrs. Fox collected their nightly scraps, Mr. Fox, seemingly innocent, wandered past the Miller’s house, behind the barn, and into the chicken coop. What he discovered there was a large, white egg. Unable to carry it, however, he used one of the children’s old wicker doll carriage and rolled the egg into it. Just as slyly, as he entered, Mr. Fox rolled out of the coop, past the barn and house and back into the safety of the forest.

When Mrs. Fox returned from collecting their dinner, she was surprised to see a giant egg in a wicker doll carriage. “What is it?” She asked, having never seen an egg that size before.

“It’s an egg!” exclaimed Mr. Fox proudly. “The farmer has a chicken house next to the barn. See, we no longer have to eat scraps anymore. We can feast on all the eggs we want from their chicken house.”

Mrs. Fox was not impressed. “The farmer and his family have been kind to us. They give us food and don’t chase us away. Why do we need to steal from them?”

“Mrs. Fox,” he belittled her. “You do not see the big picture. They feed us scraps, but keep their prized eggs for themselves. If they were truly kind, they would also share their eggs, too.”

Mrs. Fox did not see quite like Mr. Fox did, but did not argue anymore. She left him with his big egg. Sitting with the wicker doll carriage, Mr. Fox tried to think of a way to enjoy his new treat. Climbing into the carriage, he tried to bite the shell, but it was much too hard. He pawed at it, but the shell was much too smooth. Growing tired, Mr. Fox curled around his prize, dreaming of the golden treasure inside.

Early the next morning, Mr. Fox was awakened by crackling coming from the shell. Leaping out of the carriage, he waited for the next surprise. A new born chick would be more satisfying than a gooey yolk, he thought.

“Cheep, cheep.” A yellow head popped through the cracked shell. Mr Fox’s eyes grew wide with delight. All the possibilities with his own chicken… a new idea sparked in his head.

“What is that noise?” Mrs. Fox exclaimed as she climbed out from their oak tree burrow. “It’s… it’s a chick!”

“It hatched,” Mr. Fox stated triumphantly.

“Are you going to eat it?” she asked. “It’s awfully big for a baby chicken.”

“I have a better idea!” Mr. Fox stated enthusiastically. “If the farmer can raise chickens, we can too. With our very own chicken, we can eat all the eggs we want!”

As before, Mrs. Fox did not argue, but took no part in Mr. Fox’s scheme. Each night, they collected their scraps and Mr. Fox fed his chicken. And the chicken grew… and grew… and grew. So big, in just a few weeks, it barely fit in the wicker doll carriage. Refusing to let his chicken roam free, Mr. Fox pushed his chicken everywhere. Soon they had to make multiple trips to feed his baby.

Mr. Fox’s chicken soon was no longer a baby, but it still demanded all of his attention. At night when it was hungry, it would let out a loud “HONK” until he pushed the carriage to the scrap pile. If Mr. Fox ignored his chicken, it pecked his head. If Mr. Fox was angry at it, it bit his tail. Mr. Fox pushed his chicken everywhere it wanted to go, but he knew he would eventually get his reward.

One night, the Miller family were out early on their porch, when the seven year old Miller girl cried out in delight to her mother. “Look Mommy,” pointing to Mr. Fox pushing the wicker doll carriage. “That daddy fox is pushing that big, boy goose in my old baby carriage.”
