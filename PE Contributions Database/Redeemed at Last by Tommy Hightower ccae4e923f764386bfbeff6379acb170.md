***Redeemed at Last* by Tommy Hightower**

What an empty shell was I who entered the baptismal ceremony. What a corrupted soul I had: nothing about me was fit for mercy because it was so filled with self-loathing shame for what I’ve become.

Then I saw the joy in the eyes of my fellow convicts who sincerely renounced their old selves and took on the wings of angels who fly as eagles. Free at last, Lord of Mercy, free at last.

I wanted that too, and I knew it was time for me to quit trying to do it alone. I took the plunge and prepared my cleansing for weeks ahead of that day. Purged the old self, old thought, and old ways.

Then, that day arrived. Surrounded by close brothers as we shared the blood of the Lord, Savior, Redeemer, there was not a dry eye in the house. I knew why these men were crying since as I arose, I shedded an old sinful self. I felt found, redeemed, and cleaned. My eyes filled with tears for every person who is redeemed by their Creator. “Once I was lost, but now I am found.” How about you?
