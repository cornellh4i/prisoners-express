***This Girl is Everywhere* by Robert Richter**

Is she pretty? She looks scared--no--spooked, more startled than afraid. It is strange to me that anything could ever surprise her. After all, she is everywhere in the Universe but doesn’t know it since she’s human.

This lonely girl in the rain carries an umbrella but does not ever wonder why it works. No, it never occurs to her to ask why things fall down. That’s what down is, the one direction which things fall. Pretty girls don’t care about such things.
