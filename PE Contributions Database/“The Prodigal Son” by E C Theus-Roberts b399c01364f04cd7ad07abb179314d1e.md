**“The Prodigal Son” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

“Jaime, where’s your jacket?” asked Slyvia. In Union City, ice and snow coated the sidewalks. On the streets, it cracked, melting from rock salt and car exhaust. It was maybe 30 degrees outside. With the wind it felt like twelve. People in cars passing by stared. “Look at that crazy kid,” they’d probably say. It didn’t bother Jaime. Slyvia tried again, “Jaime, you know dad’s gonna be mad again?”

“Yeah, I know,” he shivered.

“What happened to your jacket?”

“Same thing as last time,” he couldn’t help smiling.

“The neighbor’s dog? Again? Jaime!”

“Yeah. Yeah. I know… I already know Slyvia… ¡Ya basta!” Comfortable silence accompanied them the rest of their way home. When they reached the apartment, Jaime’s teeth wouldn’t stop clattering.

“Ay, ¡ahí está mi princesa! Anda, wen aquí mi corazón,” greeted Raúl, their father. Slyvia obliged, kissing the rough stubble on his cheek. Jaime waited in the doorway. Raúl locked glossy eyes with his oldest. One look. ‘He’s drunk,’ thought Jaime. He didn’t enter. Slyvia went off to their room, tears threatening.

“Close the door estupido. Y, ¡metáte aquí!” ordered Raúl. His thick, well-used, good-for-everything, brown leather belt was already half out of his pants’ loops. Raúl asked, “where’s chour chacket mijo?”

The first syllables left Jaime’s lips as the belt whizzed through the air. It's buckle hit him on his jaw’s left side, just above the neck. Pain sizzled. The next one scored his shoulder. Then, his full lips. His jaw again, right side. Jaime curled into a ball. Every lashing punctuated by a curse, “estupido. Malcriado. Hijo de puta. Tonto. Comemierda. Desagradecido.”

In their room, Slyvia sobbed. For the next three days she went to school alone. No one asked about Jaime.

“Jaime?” asked Slyvia, “¿por qué no tienes zapatos?”

Busted lips, he smiled, “el perro de nuestro vecino.”

Slap. “Ouch! Hey, that hurts stupid!” cried Jaime. Slyvia crossed her arms, glaring. It was 26 degrees.

“Not as stupid as you. The dog? Again? Jaime, just tell dad they got stolen or something, please!” begged Slyvia, carefully outlining five day old cuts on his face.

“He only does it when he’s drunk.”

“He’s always drunk.”

Jaime’s head drooped, “I know…”

Slap. “Pendejo!” Punch. “Cabrón! Desagradecido.” Jaime fell to the floor. Fresh blood coloring his new, tan coat. It was a few more kicks later when he passed out. He awoke, his head in Slyvia’s lap, her singing “Te Busco,” by Celía Cruz; their mother’s favorite. Tears fell on his face. Jaime went back to sleep.

The next day.

“I no work all f--ing damned day por nada. Chou idiot! How yous lose everything?! Huh?” Raúl was too drunk to finish. An inspired kick. He stumbled away. ‘Thank God for small favors,’ thought Jaime.

Slyvia was vexed. If her brother wasn’t missing clothes, shoes, or his backpack, entirely. He didn’t have his lunch bag, or all of the above. She knew he wasn’t forgetful. He didn’t get picked on by anyone, save their dad. She just couldn’t figure it out. She’d ask. He’d smile, say the same old thing, “the neighbor’s dog,” the “, I know.” He’d come home, get beat and never cry or say anything. ‘Someday,’ thought Slyvia, ‘he’s really going to get hurt.’

“Someday,” was a month later. A serious concussion, cracked ribs and collar bone.

The hospital wasn’t far from their apartment. On the weekends she smuggled him in sofrito, black beans and rice - moros y cristianos. She wasn’t his only visitor. No worries, detective Slyvia was on the case. Two and a half weeks later, she found her man, New Jersey Devils’ hat, tan jacket, black and red nikes, Raphael, the ninja turtle, backpack; all her brother’s. She followed the culprit home. In a surprise attack, she knocked him to the ground, just inside his apartment doorway.

“Myri!” screamed two hand-me-down-clad children. They swarmed to protect Myriam. The oldest, no more than five, said, “hey, meanie! You leave my sister alone.”

Myriam lay sprawled behind her tiny defenders, terrified, embarrassed.

“Qué chingada?” cursed Slyvia, bewildered. Four hours later, Myriam and Slyvia said goodbye. Myriam said “please don’t tell him.”

“I promise, Myri. I’ll never say anything.”

“He talks about you so much Slyvie. Thank you. I don’t know what we’d do without him…”

Jaime’d left the hospital that day, alone. He was home when Slyvia returned, “where the hell have you been all dam-”

Slyvia ran to the couch and onto his lap. “Ouch, stupid! I’m still hurt dummy!”

Smooch!

“What was that for weirdo?”

“Because, I have the most awesomest, dumb brother alive…”
