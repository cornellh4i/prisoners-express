**Cave by Anthony Kenley**

The end of the world may catch us by surprise, but it won’t catch me unprepared. This cave is going to be a retreat. It’s going to be home if need be. The seclusion will be its best protection.

If I can get my family and friends here we’ll survive. There’s a river down the slope. There’s plenty of open fields close for herds and planting. Woods enough for several lifetimes of firewood. Plenty of wild game in the area.

Picture this. Move this boulder out of the way. Put a cinderblock wall across this entrance. A little effort and it’s done. A door and a large window installed and a secure home made. Put in two wood stoves. One for mostly heat and one for mostly cooking. Vent the exhaust out above the doorway. Furnish the place with needed beds and tables and chairs, etc. No sense in going rustic when there’s no need.

We plan to salvage old barns and houses to get needed lumber and accessories. Build a kitchen area with cabinets and counters. We’ll build closets and shelving and whatever is needed out of free lumber.

There’s enough room in here for multiple families. The cave spreads out greatly past the entrance. It’s nearly perfect for our uses.

We need to get the wall constructed to protect our supplies from scavengers. I’d hate to return to torn up and eaten supplies or an animal claiming property rights.

We’re going to put an A frame at the cliff top to lower supplies with a block and tackle and a winch. Do it the quick and easy way. We’re planning on putting a solar system up top wired down to the cave. We’ll put the batteries down here and store the panels until needed. That will give us power and lights.

It’s going to be difficult because of the water situation, but we can put rainwater collection basins up top and plumb to the cave. We can haul water from the river and store it here too.

We’ll start the building process soon. Got to get started so we’ll be ready in time.
