**“Gold in the Bank” by Matthew Tomlinson**

****Princess glowered at me. The microwave chimed. “We can work this entrapment problem out, princess. There’s room for give-and-take.

Princess couldn’t have weighed much over 120 pounds. Her 68 inches frame was a straight fence post design. Those hip-huggers had almost nothing to hold. Incongruously, Princess boasted the typical latina full bust line. The top two buttons of her beige blouse were left loose to show more than the creamy cleavage between the d-cup beauties. No doubt Princess had sweet success when she worked Vice.

Princess was busily looking at all aspects of the matter. “ I’m married. You’ve got your peppermint”. Princess wanted an out. She wanted to avoid having to accept responsibility for tossing an eight ball in my lap, on video.

“Peppermint well knows I cruise Airline Drive”. Two cups of coffee were brought to the table. “I’ve never touched her”. You can run, Princess Gold, but you can’t hide.

Princess finished her pastry. “Nothing oral”.

“Straight missionary. Afterward we trash the video. I do whatever you want on the case”.

Princess surrendered with a resigned sigh. “For the first time in my marriage!”. She rose from the table. “That’s our deal. Nothing oral, just regular missionary. You destroy the video. You help me on the murder case”.

“Almost! Nothing oral on your part. Fellatio has always been a turn-off”. My chair squeaked as my weight pushed it back. “But you have to let me kiss anywhere I like. Nose to toes, it all goes. Regular missionary other than that. I’ll destroy the video. I’ll help you on the murder case. Deal?”.

Princess looked at the linoleum. “Deal, then. Let me get a shower”.

My finger found her zipper. My hand moved gently downward. “You’re clean enough”.

Princess let me lead her to my front bedroom. She permitted me to unbutton the rest of her beige blouse, then hang it up. Princess reached into her bra for her ID folder. She sat it on the dresser. Her cell phone came out next. A tiny change purse followed. Several loose bills were unloaded. A small notepad was last. Finally she reached behind her to unlatch the beige bolder-holder. “All right. Here you are”. She turned to face me for the liberation scene. They might have been only d-cup but they appeared to be double-d. She allowed me to hang up her bra with her blouse.

On my dresser was a plastic box that originally had been a soap dish. On top of the box were a set of 9 illuminated push buttons. Normally the lights are off for default. When I hung up Princess’ bra, all nine were flashing in random combinations. Why would the sparkle circuit be activated? “Princess? You wouldn’t, by any chance, have touched this, would you?”.

Princess came to the dresser. “I put everything at the other end, here. I never touched that”. She watched the lights dance. “Is it some kind of radio?”.

“Would KD5CHN possess a soap dish with illuminated push buttons if it weren’t?”. The four corner buttons were tapped. “On. Three. Nine. Seven. Your turn. Press the 5 button”.

Princess reached in front of me to initiate the 1397 process. Her left breast brushed my cheek. She pressed the center 5 button. The Jeep honked once, then paused. It gave three more honks, then waited. Then it counted off nine short honks. Lastly it sounded seven honks. All push button lights went off. The 1397 process was complete.

Princess shrugged. “What was that about?”.

“You liked my story. ‘The two-five-five project’ about the robot we built in 1975 in high school. The soap dish there is an updated version of the Prisoner Express story. The Jeep has a proximity sensor. Someone entered my yard. They got close to the Jeep. It sent a signal to make this box Sparkle. Then you scared off the thief”.

Princess didn’t go to the window. Topless, she was in no shape to do it. “Look, let’s get a room. I’m uncomfortable feeling like there are eyes everywhere.” She reached to redeem her bra.

“Deal’s off?”

Princess was in no shape to rescind her word. “No. A deal is a deal.”

One last look at those luscious breasts made me sigh with as much resignation as Princess had sighed at the table. “Get dressed.” Yeah, You Can Run, Princess Gold, But You Can’t Hide. “A deal is a deal, you said?” The spooked cop’s dignity was offered for redemption. “I’ll take a raincheck.”

“Raincheck!” She agreed abruptly. Princess had found her way out. She’d found a way to delay accepting responsibility for tossing dope in my lap, on video. “You’ve got that in the bank. My word on that, Tee Dee.”

“On call. When I want it.”

“On call. Anytime.” Princess fastened her bra. “Will you take me to Fiesta on Airline Drive at North Freeway, where you picked me up? My car is there.”

On the trip northward back up Airline, a radical thought clicked. We stopped behind a red roller skate subcompact in Fiesta parking lot. “Here, take my house key. There’s no booby traps, nothing. I want you to come and go around my Shack any time you please. Peppermint’s friend is always welcome. Just leave a note on the refrigerator notepad.”

The would-be adulteress, redeemed at least for the nonce, waved as she drove away.
