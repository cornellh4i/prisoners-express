***On the Slick Steps of the Fieldhouse* by David Joseph Kiluk**

The grey Tuesday morning in December brought freezing rain, sheets of which accumulated on the windshield of Tracey’s Toyota. She exhaled with annoyance, scraping off the icy precipitation as the engine warmed.

She drove her normal weekday commute to the University and was lucky to snag a parking spot on the street near the entrance of the fieldhouse. On Tuesdays, her first class wasn’t until 12:30PM, and so she figured she’d surprise Mark by meeting him at the fieldhouse before his noon hockey practice. Because she’d already eaten her cinnamon and raisin bagel in the driver’s seat while waiting for the traffic lights on University Drive, she would have enough time to see Mark before class without worrying about lunch.

Eying the blowing sleet, she reached into the backseat and grabbed her fuchsia umbrella and thrusted it open, holding it above her for shelter against the wicked December precipitation.

She adjusted her right heel-strap and carefully crossed the icy lane when she noticed Mark standing on the fieldhouse steps with… Kathy Newton? They were standing nose-to-nose on the top step, cackling and chortling. Kathy threw her head back, making her hair fall into her face and letting Mark straighten it at her ears. The sleet was obscuring her eyes, and for a minute, she thought it wasn’t Mark. She squinted and wiped her face with the cuff of her coat to see that it was him. Because he glanced over at her, she quickly held her umbrella out before her like Zeus’ shield; he didn’t notice her. She fled behind a light post then closed the umbrella, staying out of his sight.

The deep pink of her umbrella matched her muffled lipstick and embarrassingly, her complexion. The sleet was changing to snow, and the convoluted flakes were growing larger and larger just like her anger. They covered her head and face, making her mascara run and dampening her hair which she got done in the way Mark liked. She remembered how his fingers ran through it two nights ago under the stars in his front yard when they sat on the hood of his Jeep Wrangler. It reminded her of the way he flipped her bangs out of her eyes while sitting cross-legged together on the dock of the beach house during one summer afternoon.

They met as high school juniors, and she was immediately attracted to him and loved his ruddy looks, winsome smile, and the way he would hold her while they danced. As seniors, they were inseparable at every major event: homecoming, prom, graduation, and summer vacation. They were made for each other. Or so she thought.

They were both accepted to University during the summer and were excited to attend together because it was a commuter college: they could still live at home and continue to see each other. She enrolled in the teacher education program and couldn’t wait to take practicums which required her to work with needy kids. Her ultimate goal was to have her own children and start a big family with Mark.

Mark wanted to attend because he figured he could make their hockey team as a walk-on, and so he practiced tirelessly five afternoons a week starting in August. He skated and shot pucks until the sweat would drip off his forehead, and then he would shower and do the same in the evening. He made the team as a starting forward, and while the games began in October, Tracey noticed a difference in him before that. He started hanging out with his buddies from the team and their fans, mostly pretty girls. They had an undying passion for the sport and followed the team everywhere. Tracey couldn’t understand their fierce fervency--shouldn’t they be putting that energy toward their future aspirations?

Kathy’s right foot suddenly slipped off the top step, but she fell into Mark’s chest as he held her steady. She buried her face deep in his varsity jacket the same way Tracey did took solace in him.

Mark grabbed both her hands and slowly leaned toward her with his mouth ajar, and their lips met in a tender kiss which caused them both to step back and smile. He hugged her tightly in his arms, her breath misting at his neck.

All of Tracey’s dreams came crashing to a halt: their elegant wedding, their Hawaiian honeymoon, formal galas she would attend in lacy dresses clutching Gucci purses, hospital stays bearing children, family holidays, grandchildren running around their rocking chairs on the front porch, and their retirement on their 50-foot sailboat in the Caribbean.

While her coat and skin were thoroughly drenched, Mark and Kathy were still embracing each other and happily swaying in each other’s arms on the top step of the fieldhouse. The way she saw it, Tracey had two choices. She could walk away then quietly break it off with him, citing some trivial reason like they were growing apart and needed space.

Or she could confront him. She could stomp right over, break up their little tryst, and put him on the spot. But that would mean causing a scene. Could she do that? When she remembered the fleeting dreams, she snapped her umbrella open and marched toward the steps.
