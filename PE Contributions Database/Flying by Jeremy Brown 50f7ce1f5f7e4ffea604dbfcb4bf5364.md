**Flying by Jeremy Brown**

“Realize that whatever you desire already exists and is calling to you and that by repeating its name you draw it to you.” Henry Victor Morgan

I’ve flown Southwest 15 times. I love looking out the window and watching how small everything gets. I don’t get sick on the plane. Only when I get off. I’ve been sick 14 out of 15 times. A terrible Rhinovirus gets in my lungs and I’m weak for a month. The best airport I’ve ever been to was in Kansas. It was all circular. I was 12 and I wasn’t scared I was very curious about every nook and cranny. That curiosity has brought me to where I am today doing massive amounts of research on damn near everything. I have 2 Uncles who are ex Air Force pilots. So when I was 16 I was put through a gruesome 4 week study course on flying. The fun came later. I was in a small 6 seater plane and sat next to the pilot. After take off he handed me the controls. I flew all around Tampa Bay area. It was awesome. I felt like I had purpose. To this day I still dream of being a pilot so I vicariously pilot my six video game 3d simulators on a 3rd Generation 7inch tablet. In the background is System of a Downplaying, and I’m having a blast going fast through Tron like Environments shooting enemies down. My Uncle Mark flies Delta or Southwest now I can’t remember. His picture in the command seat is my background to my tablet. He looks as cool as he can be.
