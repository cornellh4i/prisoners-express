**The Ugly Truth by Anonymous**

Prisoners’ Lives Matter? In my humble experience, all evidence to the contrary. I can’t say I blame ‘em. Not if I’m being truly honest with myself.

In nature, those that don’t conform to the Social order are treated harshly and usually end up dead. Similarly, we, inmates,  are also considered dead- for all intent and purposes- just not buried. I can't blame anyone, but myself. It's no one's fault beyond my own. It's not like a Black Lives Matter scenario- people don't have a choice in their race. I can't speak for anyone else, but I deserve to be here- a home for weak men who didn't have the strength to say no to their worst instincts.

I'm sure my Victim hates me, but no one can loathe me more than I do myself. I can't stand my own reflection. My life only matters in the sense that I should be forced to live this nightmare. And I do. I do my time humbly and in the small act I hope I can begin to repay the debt I owe.
