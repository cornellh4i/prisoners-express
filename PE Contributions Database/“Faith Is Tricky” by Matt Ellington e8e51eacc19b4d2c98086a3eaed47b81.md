**“Faith Is Tricky” by Matt Ellington**

Having faith is the hardest of things

Not just mysteries beyond

But in what you might bring

To the world. There’s a line in between

Knowing what truly is and

Things yet to be seen.

Do you yield to the world as it tries

To weigh you to Earth

And open your eyes?

Or instead, give a lift to your dreams

Regardless, to others,

How hopeless it seems?

Can you live with living a lie

Trading comfort for shame

On the day that you die?

Or is life worth the possible pain

Of you taking a risk for

Soul fulfilling gain?

Be careful for if you should choose

A life filled with hope,

There are things you can lose.

Yet I’ll wager that choosing the safe way

Has much more severe

Of a price you will pay.
