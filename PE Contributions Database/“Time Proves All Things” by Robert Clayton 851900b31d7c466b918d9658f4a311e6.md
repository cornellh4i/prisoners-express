**“Time Proves All Things” by Robert Clayton**

In ancient times, there was what was called the redemption of the firstborn. But, the truth of the matter is far more complex than the previous sentence. Because explanations as to why were forbidden. This is proven within our religious commands. Even though they were written by humans. Then, in turn, edited the soulless savage, claiming to be refined. I personally believe, that even this, serves a purpose.

Real men, don’t follow: children, preachers, or, teachers. They revolve around those, that do not ever use many words. So, the only thing told to them, was that it served a higher purpose. And, by doing it this way. There was no second guessing, as to why they just had their free will taken away. Then, they set off in a particular direction. A newly ordained sacrifice. Traveling, from well to well.

They created the veil, as well. Or, virgins would not be allowed to exist any longer. For it was little girls, that went to fetch the water. Usually, five at a time. So this device, they shaped and molded. Was called by them divine and sacred. And drafted into both institutional and religious law. With it strengthened still further, by only giving the great redeemer very few provisions. Sometimes, even making them fast for several days before allowing them to set out.

An abuser, scorner, manipulator, dissembler, child-molester, has always existed. So in order to protect even an enemy’s daughter, the veil was made manifest. But, when it was soon realized, it would not be enough. A new hero emerged, full grown. Along with a story, though ever-changing. Held on to one pure truth, which was, is, and hopefully, forever will be. That an Egyptian saved them. Not a Hebrew slave.

We may do this today. And little girls all around the - would be, still diverse - world, will say that an American saved them. So enlist in National Guard, Coast Guard, Peace Corp., army, navy, Air Force, marines. Or, if you can’t make it. Perhaps even if they no longer have space to fill. Join similar branches, within the Canadians. After all, they’re Americans too. But, that there is a secret for another time. Be good!
