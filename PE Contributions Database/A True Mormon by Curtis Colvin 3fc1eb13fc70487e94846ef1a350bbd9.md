***A True Mormon* by Curtis Colvin**

There she is, a true picture of a clean-living Mormon: innocent, sweet, and trustworthy. She never smokes anything, never imbibed alcohol, stays away from coffee and tea. She doesn’t need any stimulants. Life to her is full of grace. Her spirit propels her to do good. Even in the rain, she is on her way to perform some service work for a poor widow. Pure and chaste, firm in her beliefs, a person whom all should be like.

In this world today, it is so hard to keep Our Lord’s commandments. Between all the lying, cheating, killing, and depravity, anyone can fall for Satan’s Wills. He cannot force you to do bad. WE all have a freedom of choice. Choose to do right no matter what.

For this girl, her future is bright. She is into service work in helping others to come to Christ. Just being an example is worth its weight in gold. She will probably marry a returning missionary, go to the temple, and be sealed as a family, forever and eternity. God will bless her in her endeavors, and despite her trials and tribulations, her path is a wonderful one, one of a true Mormon.
