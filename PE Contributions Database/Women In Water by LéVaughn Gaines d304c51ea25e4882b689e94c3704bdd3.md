**"Women In Water" by LéVaughn Gaines**

Fear--I just don’t know the meaning of that word. But I know how to live it. I don’t fear the boogeyman under my bed or the monsters in my closet. I fear bombs exploding nearby. Bullets ripping through the things that are supposed to keep me safe and the people that I love. Those are the things that I fear. I used to hear stories about children playing war games. War is no game to be played.

Two...two...two--has it been hours or just minutes? I can’t remember. My body is numb from the water and I haven’t slept in days. Food is just a dream, a fragment of my imagination. I eat grass like a *hwou*, a common animal. The soldiers hunt us like lions looking for their prey.

There are female soldiers among the men. I always saw women as nurturers. We call the *me hu*, broken mothers. They are worse than the male soldiers. They have the charm to deceive you and are so broken they are not afraid to die. The Vietminh are somewhere upstream. We don’t know where the Vietcong are, but both will kill us if we are spotted. The U.S. has continually dropped chemicals on our soil, wiping out our food source and only foliage for us to use as cover.

I don’t know what this war is for, but mother says I’m too young to understand politics and worry about such things. I accept her answer, but silently let my imagination run wild. The National Liberation Front use to gather the adults and make long speeches to them. Father said their words were not meant for little girls’ ears. The little girl died in me the day bombs began exploding in our rural village, killing many, including my father.

The Cambodian border is just a mile away, but it feels like years away. The *tan tat* are slowing us down, but we are a family and we refuse to leave the disabled behind. I speak with two brothers frequently on our voyage. Bao and Thinh teach me about our culture and history, reminding me what it means to be *Viet*. They talk to me as if I am an adult--an equal. I feel proud.

The sixteen people in our group are what’s left of our village. We are now a family, a tribe of survivors. The last of the Frenchmen have left us. The French were annoying to my father, but I found their religious views interesting. Although I often wonder where Jesus is, the one they say is the savior. I tried praying--nothing good ever happens. Maybe we are all lost souls--*lac dwong*.

We are just 300 yards from the Cambodian border, but we are stuck. A fire fight has begun ahead of us. Panic and fear are taking over my body. I hold on to my grandmother to give her strength, even though I need some of my own. The fire fight grows. Bombs are exploding. Cries of agony...screams of pain...shouts of victory. A plane flies over and something falls from it...SILENCE.
