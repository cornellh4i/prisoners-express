**“Baby Steps” by Vicki Hicks**

The journey through life begins in our mother’s womb where we use her as a punching bag, kicking with our tiny baby feet. At times, she looks down and sees a baby foot sticking out. Soon, we use those tiny feet to take our very first wobbly steps. Although we stumble, many times we get up and brush off our hands and keep going. Soon, we are teenagers trying to take big steps to rush through life only to stumble. We get up and brush ourselves off and start back with baby steps. Adulthood finds all kinds of new adventures but along the way, we have learned how to take baby steps. When we take big steps that we stumble and learn that God gave us baby feet so we would take baby steps into each new season and journey of our lives. Today is not a destination, but the first steps on a lifelong journey.
