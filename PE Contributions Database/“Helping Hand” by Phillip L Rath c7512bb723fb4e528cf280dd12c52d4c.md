**“Helping Hand” by Phillip L. Rath**

I long for the days long past when neighbors realized a need in their fellows and quietly stepped in with a helping hand, without fanfare, publicity or any expectation of accolades. No television pleas, radio marathons or electronic requests to Fund Me. Neighbors, friends and family knew when their efforts were needed and they offered a willing helping hand.

Now, people shutter their windows and monitor their phones so they can ignore the needs of their neighbors and community. People expect “someone” to offer aid, but they never take time to consider who that someone will be if not them!

Charities spend more on employee perks and promotions so there is little left to meet the shortcomings of those who find themselves in need. Politicians spend millions in studies to ascertain a need while leaving little to actually address the problem.

Maybe it is hard for me to see any helping hands these days because my windows too, are shuttered and my hands clasped firmly behind my back.
