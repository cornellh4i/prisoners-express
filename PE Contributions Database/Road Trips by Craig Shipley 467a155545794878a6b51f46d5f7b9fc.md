**"Road Trips" by Craig Shipley**

All over our country people travelling around,

Cars, trucks and campers roam from town to town.

A few days here and a few days there,

no telling who you’ll meet or where.

It’s freedom at its finest when you’re on the road,

nobody with a leash telling you where to go.

Get some cash saved up and pick a spot today,

A good ole’ road trip is not far away.
