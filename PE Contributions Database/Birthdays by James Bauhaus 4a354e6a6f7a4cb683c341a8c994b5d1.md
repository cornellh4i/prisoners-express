**Birthdays by James Bauhaus**

Birthdays are for children. It’s good for children to be recognized by adults and have their little egos boosted, just to get some self-esteem, to learn what it’s like to be the center of attention and learn how to deal with it. This part of the socialization process gives children the confidence to push past others with their ideas, benefiting everyone when their ideas are the best, or at least better than those currently available.

Birthdays are also for mothers. There is nothing more wholesome and evocative of kindness than the interaction between a mother and her child. The younger the mother and infant the more soothing and healing the sight of their play together is.

Birthdays for adults tend to be between family members, though the socialization process should have progressed to completion by the end of adolescence.

Birthdays of friends are just awkward, as it’s just a matter of fishing for presents. Birthdays are bonanzas for the government’s tax-and-spend politicians. They feast off of each individual for a lifetime, wasting most of what they harvest while charging us double-platinum prices for piss-poor excuses that barely suffice as governance. There is always a lot of interest, and profit, in birthdays!
