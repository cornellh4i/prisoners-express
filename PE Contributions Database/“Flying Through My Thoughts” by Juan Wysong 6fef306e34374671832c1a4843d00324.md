**“Flying Through My Thoughts” by Juan Wysong**

Close my eyes becoming free

Daring to venture beyond these walls

Curious as to what lies right down the hall outside my bedroom door

Floating weightless through open skies

With the wind against my skin

Now that I’m free, just let me be on my way and soar

No need for wings and parachutes

Gliders or aeroplanes

The wide-open awaiting for me to drift along the breeze

Finding solace within my fall

Plunging through thoughts and my ideas

In this heaven, I’m the master inside my mind while drifting free

Biting on my bed yet so far away

Traveling deep inside my bed

Allowing myself to descend back to the earth in a gentle glide

Back down the halls with dreary walls

I find myself inside my room

My trip is over as I slowly begin to open up my eyes.
