**"Tears of War" by Gilbert Vasquez**

In times of war many things are shed. Blood is shed on both sides. Bullets are shed from the machines which cause the blood to shed forth in immense amounts. Despite the carnage these machines cause, companies and countries continue to shed forth these machine of mass destruction.

Above all that is shed in times of war is the tears. Tears of pain. Tears of loss. Tears of helplessness. Tears of hunger. The tears shed from war are infinite. Even years after wars are over, tears are shed by many on all sides.

The tears of war are lost to those who wage the wars of senseless motives. Greed, hate and power are only a few of the motives for war. Many are blinded by these motives, while many more are blinded by the tears of war.

I pray that one day we can shed forth tears of compassion, tears of love, tears of empathy, and tears of happiness. I pray the tears of war can come to an end and that they be replaced with tears of peace.
