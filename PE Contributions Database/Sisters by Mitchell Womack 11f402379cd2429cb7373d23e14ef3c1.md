**Sisters by Mitchell Womack**

Only two-and-a-half years apart, my sister Tati and I were closer as kids than each of us were respectively to our brother David. Naturally of course, he being about a decade older than us.

With unbridled imagination we acted our adventures together. We shared best friends. We’d laugh at mom and dad together. We broke rules together, and, when caught, we bore punishments together.

I remember once, when we were both “grounded” in our respective rooms, we drilled a hold in the wall that separated our closets, so that we could talk. Now that I can compare it to being incarcerated, being able to communicate in our little secret way was like getting a letter during mailcall, or getting a visit, or having a collect call accepted.

I wish we would’ve remained close, but, looking back, it’s like we grew apart as we went different directions in life. The blame is mine, I feel like.

Tati just wanted to feel normal, to be an average teenager, but I got into drugs and alcohol at a really early age, not going to school, not following any of mom’s rules - seemingly intent on being as abnormal and chaotic as possible. And it wasn’t long before I began getting into trouble with the law.

I remember my first time being released from Juvenile detention center after having spent about a month. Mom drove to where Tati was staying with a friend. Tati didn’t know that I got out. Mom parked regularly, and got out when Tati and her friend approached from behind. I let them talk for about thirty seconds before opening the passenger-side door. I could hear Tati ask, “Who’s that?” Then a quick gasp as she realized it was me. She hurried over to me and hugged me really tight. The length of the hug was a testament to how much she truly missed me, and thought to her “Lil Bro” and despite myself, I remember realizing that my eyes were watering.

That was just one of many releases from juvenile detention centers to residential juvenile programs. As I think about all the times I seen her after not seeing her for a while, I recall how she gradually became more indifferent to my being released. The novelty was lost, after all.

From her perspective, it has to seem like her adolescence and young adult years were punctuated by my arrests and releases.

At the age of 19, I graduated to the adult system with a bunch of cases. For all the indifference I might’ve perceived her to have had, she cried harder than anyone else when I was sentenced to seventeen years.

That was seven years ago, and I haven’t seen her since (because of a combination of visitation suspensions, and how far they sent me from home.) I remember talking to her on the phone a couple of months ago - first time in years - and we marveled at how different we each sounded to the other.

And different she is: with a job making $700 a week, raising two kids on her own (and doing a hell of a job), being there for my mom. And, out of all things - Boxing classes! Gotta love sisters.
