**“Water For Tears” by Keith Pertusio**

Men lay around him like corpses baking under the murderous sun. Georgio collapsed among the ruins of yet another desert-claimed town. Their water was nearly gone, rationed by indifferent guards too exhausted to lift their huns. Thirst makes all men equal.

A shadow Georgio squinted up at the boy standing over him.

“Marcello,” he gasped, struggling to sit. “Son, where have you been?”

Eight-year-old hands fluttered. He had not spoken since their capture. “Water,” he signed.

Georgio sighed. *Once*, he thought, *I could have given you the world. Now I fail your most simple request.*

“You know there’s none.”

“Water,” Marcello sighed.

He was useless to his son, a dried-up husk.

“Stop,” he ordered, “Talk.” He must talk. The traffickers must hear him talk.

Hands waved. “Water,” they insisted.

Georgio seized the boy’s hands and smacked them, too weak to cause pain. Yet, Marcello stumbled away, eyes wide. He had never struck him before. He reached for his son, arms plended. Marcello stepped back.

*Son,* Giorgio thought, *how can I make you understand that if you do not talk, you will die?*

Marcello’s hands fumbled, desperate to speak, then fell sadly to his sides.

My poor, obedient boy, Georgio groaned.

The guards stared. Without words, the boy was of no use to them. He had overheard their discussion in the morning. They would leave those of no value behind to die so the others might survive. Without water, no one would live long.

If only he could explain. But his son must never know. Today is probably his last day and he should be happy.

*But I have ruined even that,* he thought.

Marcello waited, shoulders slumped, jace defeated.

“Go play, Marcello,” Georgio whispered. The shadow hesitated, then disappeared. The sun beat down again and he discovered he could still cry. Even without water for tears.

Dusk approached, the shadow longer but the town still an over.

“Marcello,” Georgio rasped. Silence. His absence tugged at him. He rolled to his knees, searching. His son must not be alone. Not tonight. He pulled himself to his feet with a cry. He had strength left.

“One more night. Then we will die together,” he promised. The guards sat too weak to care as he staggered into the ruins.

He stumbled through the maze of decomposing houses beneath the full moon, the atmosphere gradually cooling. As his energy faded, he crawled.

Then, a cry.

“Marcello!” he called, frantically pulling himself forward. A cry below him. Confusion. Then, a splash. Lunging ahead, he heaved himself onto the walls of a well. He peered down, moist air rising. A cry from the bottom. With the pulley, rope, and rediscovered strength, he pulled and pulled until a dripping head emerged. Then dark eyes staring into his. The boy climbed out, water splashing off him into newborn puddles.

Then, Georgio stood tall. His hands moved.

“Water,” he said apologetically. Marcello stepped forward and took Georgia’s hands in his own, pressing gently. He turned and drew a red bucket from the well. He tilted it to his father’s lips until water cascaded down, glistening silver in the moonlight.

Later, refreshed, they chased and drenched one another with buckets of water from the endless source. Laughter echoed off the crumbling houses until father and son collapsed together, dripping and shivering beneath the stars.

In the morning, the traffickers were gone. With water, the men left behind revived and grew like seeds. Georgio watched the sun rise, this time burning death away. He felt a touch on his arm.

“Papa,” a voice whispered. Georgio pulled Marcello close, not needing another word, grateful for the tears he could finally cry.
