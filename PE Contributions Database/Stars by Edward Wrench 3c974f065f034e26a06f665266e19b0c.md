**Stars by Edward Wrench**

****I remember going to summer camp, and four others and I were on a mission. We were going to look at the stars in the field at camp in New Jersey.

I forgot the name of the camp; I donâ€™t even know where the camp was. The whole summer, we were outdoors.

It was for boys and girls, no adults except for the staff. We went on scavenger hunts, boating, hiking, swimming. We also went to the general store to get sodas back in 1980 or 1982. I wish I can go camping in a motorhome next time.
