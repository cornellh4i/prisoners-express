****“So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed effort to convert retreat into advance.”

Many of us have heard these words, or at least some of them, numerous times. If you’re like me, most of my life I hadn’t known their source. The winner of the presidential election of 1932 spoke these words during his Inaugural Address. That man was Franklin D. Roosevelt, and shortly thereafter, the Great Depression hit its peak. This normally jovial, positive and paternal man spoke very solemnly the words fit for such a sad chapter of our history. Now 84 years later, they ring just as true.

In 2016, where the same presidential race has been transformed into a successful reality show, one would think everything is peachy keen. That the decision of who is going to be the leader of the free world is treated so flippantly is scary. Two cartoon characters who could have easily come straight off the SNL set spend more time deciding their next tweet than the constant civil unrest fueled by racism or the very real threat that we are now seeing “terrorism events” on a weekly basis. I am facing fear every time I hear a news update or tune into Rush on my radio.

Mrs. Clinton has already spent eight years in the White House as First Lady (and POTUS by proxy) and another four years in the State Department under Obama. She spent most of her time as Secretary of State soliciting “donations” to the Clinton Foundation. This foundation has very little true charitable work to show for its 501(c)(3) status but millions in donations. After eight years in the Oval Office and four more in the West Wing, look at where we are, with racism and terrorism in towns across the nation. Do we still want more of the same? Some would define insanity as repeating the same action over and over, expecting different results.

On the flip side of the coin, we have a true reality star. Most expected Trump to slip on a banana peel long ago. They forgot that the days of Abe and Ike have been traded in for a reality show. Capt. Comb-over is really good at this. While Hillary is lying to not only the nation but to the FBI, Trump is sticking out his tongue and calling people names for ratings. He’s talking about building the Great Wall of Mexico, which we already know doesn’t work. Oh, and lest we forget the soap opera tactic of inviting one of the many conquests of Hillary’s unfaithful husband to the debate. Ratings!	To quote one of my favorite stand-ups Lewis Black, “Our two party system in America is a bowl of shit looking at itself in the mirror.” You want to face fear? Turn on the successful show “Decision 2016.”

I’m Eric Langley, and I approve this message.
