“When Life Gives You _ Make _”

For the past three years I’ve prayed to be placed in a smaller institution with less people, less violence, less drugs, and less problems. I just want to chill and do my last nine years in some kind of relative peace.

One day, I was a part of a mass inmate transfer to Central Florida Reception Center from Hardee C.I., due to institutional restructuring. When my group arrived at CFRC we all thought that we were in transient to go elsewhere. But to our surprise and my horror, they told us that were going to be permanents at the west unit.

All of the west unit is open-bay dorms, and all of us had just came from two man cells, so we will now be all living, breathing, and touching the same things 72 other inmates are. This is not we were accustomed to.

Most of us were angry and disappointed, thinking that this was going to forfeit our good adjustment transfer. However, the guard told us that being at CFRC will not affect our good adjustment transfer. So that was one relief. But that was it.

Adjustment to this new environment was touch and go for me. After about six months, I was finally acclimated to the constant shake downs, petty guards, fussing and fighting, noise, cigarette smoke (smoked with Bible paper or paper towels), K2 smoke (synthetic marajana that smells like burning tires), and a myriad of other things coalesced into the ambient hum of the place.

I tried to join programs. But there weren’t any except Christian programs and I’m not a Christian. So I tried to start an art program but there was no venue to begin one. So I concentrated more on my own craft. I’ve become better with my portrait art and all the other styles of drawing became relatively easy. A year and a half goes by with the same everyday mundane rituals, with my transfer still pending and my mind begging to be elsewhere.

And then one day, it happened. It was late August when I was called back to the dorm to pack my property and report to T&R (Transient and Reception).

Finally! I thought. My prayers have been answered, I’m getting out of here! But then, I thought, this is the afternoon and the timing for a transfer was kind of strange. Yet, I still thought I was being transferred to one of my approved institutions. When I arrived at T&R with a smile on my face and property in hand, I was told that I was being moved to the South Unit.

I had no idea of what I was in store for. I’ve heard of the south unit, but was never given an accurate description of the place itself, so I approached the situation with a little bit of trepidation.

I arrived at the south unit and was amazed at the set-up, there was only 70 men living there on the compound and with the 5 that came with me, that brought the total to 85 inmates with the 10 in the infirmary waiting to die. I believed that my wishes and prayers were answered.

It was very nice at first. I had a 3 man room all by myself with a shared bathroom with my only neighbor. My room door opened to the outside, we could sit outside on the benches at night and talk on the phone from one til late night. We even had weekend modern movies. It was a really nice place to be to finish up your time or your life, if you were a lifer. It was what I was wishing for, but after 6 months of this, it started to become not only boring but a very lonely place for me.

One day after receiving some really good news and wanting to share it with someone I could trust with personal matters, I looked around for someone and I looked at room doors at the clusters of people standing and sitting around in different areas, and noticed that there was no one I could talk to that I could trust enough to talk about personal things.

And that’s when I knew that this was not the best place for me. This is a prime example of the adage: be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.

So when life gives you what you want, make the best of it. Because that place was a really nice facility for some people, but not for me. Now that I am no longer there, a part of me longs to be there and a part of me doesn’t. I’ll just wish for something in between.
