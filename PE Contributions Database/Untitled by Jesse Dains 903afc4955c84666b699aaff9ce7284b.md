**Untitled by Jesse Dains**

Now listen close and I’ll reveal again

My nefarious plan to catch that hen.

The one who fancies herself a goodwife

And goes about trying to save his life

With poltises, tinctures, hot soups and salves,

She’d do well to cut his does by halves

Before his liver completely shuts down

From the snake oil she’s trying to drown

His wounds in. She has got him wound so tight

With camphor soaked linen that he just might

Suffocate ‘fore i get my teeth in him

Again. Its a good plan not just a whim. . .

No. no. no. If he sees you what then?

Stay clear of the cock, focus on the hen!

I know you feel like you have been slighted.

Heed my word and your wrongs will be righted.

I’ll stake what I say on all I hold dear!

Pertelote is the key to Chanticleer.

He’s mushy you see and sentimental.

When he learns that she’s gone it just might kill

Him. He hasn’t the sense God gave a goose.

He’d sing better if his bowels were that loose.

Please. Take no umbrage. I mean no offence.

You know, for a Fox, I can be quite dense.

Some of my thoughts should not be said aloud.

That’s a good goose. One shouldn’t be too proud.

Just hold Pertelote and do as I said.

When Chanticleer learns he might drop dead.

You may wonder what could cause such a sukun,

Some men will say its a phase of the moon,

A few will cite Eros and his fateful bow,

I’m of the school that says, men aren’t to know. . .

Ah yes, the plan, now as I was saying;

I must sound an ass with all of my braying,

The very best plans are always kept simple.

This one needs less thought than popping a pimple.

You ask Pertelote to go for a ride,

Throw a gunny sack over once she’s inside.

Then push fast and hard and head for that hill.

You must be quick before she becomes shrill.

When you get ‘round that hill you’’ find a pot,

On a tripod, filled with boiling hot

Water looking just like this one right here.

Now, you must trust me there’s no need to fear,

If this plan is to work then we must rehearse.

We’ll act out each step and recite every verse. . .

You know, in this light, your bill is exquisite

When we get done you must come and visit

A few of my friends who’ve never seen beauty

Such as yours. They’ll feel nothing but envy

As they gaze upon our seemly visage.

One glance and they’ll know your without peerage.

How you carry yourself and take each step

Goes only to show that you are adept

At the art of looking quite splendid.

I pray dear goose I am not too candid.

Just put your foot over the edge and go

In the pot. I’ll have you out before you know

It. Yes I know the water seems quite warm.

Just trust in me goose, I’ll allow no harm

To come to you while you are in my care.

I am not impued thus I do not dare

Allow a single ill to befall you

Now lets be sure that this lid fits too.

Don’t let it be said that Sir Russel Fox

Carried himself like a common lammox,

So what if I have to Plot and conive.

Beguiling fowl is what keeps me alive.

You might remember my cousin Bernard.

Now there is a fellow who tried too hard!And for what? For naught but some sour grapes.

You know even his wife still laughs and japes.

It’s gotten so bad he won’t leave the house,

He mopes around as meek as a mouse.

I will not allow fate to pin me down,

History will say Im a fox of renown!

I’ve talked so much I’ve forgotten to look,

Oh dear, I do believe this goose is cooked!
