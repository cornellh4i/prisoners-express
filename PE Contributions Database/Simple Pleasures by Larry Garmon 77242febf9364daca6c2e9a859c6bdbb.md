**"Simple Pleasures" by Larry Garmon**

Many things in my life I took for granted. Like going to the bathroom myself, or setting my own schedule when to eat, when to play, sleep, etc. I remember when I was in the free world I used to set on the front porch with a cup of coffee or a cold drink and listen to the wind blow through the trees.

In here I see concrete walls and a metal door. And the only sounds I hear are angry voices from the cell-house. When I used to enjoy peace and quiet, I get announcements from the intercom. I have a little window I can see outside, but just to be butted up against another cell-house. I can look out and see the weather to see what it's doing, but not feeling it except when it's time for chaw call. Just to hurry up and to get back in this cell of cramped space.

Little things I have in here, I use to get by or to make my life comfortable as it can be. Some are against the rules and others are legal. And most all of them are privileges, which can be taken away at any moments notice, and at any reason.

Simple pleasures of going in a grocery store and walking down aisles of aisles of choice of different food product. When our grocery shopping consists of a sheet of paper. Out there I could walk into a grocery store and walk with my product, and here we have to wait a week to get our order.

How about a simple hug from someone you love. Go to the visiting room and can only get a quick hug, if any longer than this we are considered doing more than just a hug. How about holding someone when they are troubled or having a chance to listen to how their day went.

Yes, simple pleasures of life when time used to fly by, because there were so many things to do. But in here there is nothing but to watch time crawl by. Then loneliness sets in even with all the other men that are here will not replace the emptiness that used to be filled with joy of family, the sense of being needed. Here no one is needed just wasting away. Hake it, make believe that everything is okay. What a lie. When deep down a person knows the truth. Truth, I would say that this is just another simple pleasure that's gone. In here a person can be deceived by other inmates or staff to the point where the truth does not exist anymore.

Yes simple things after a while once they're gone they don't become too simple anymore. They become lost treasures.
