***The Failed Messiah* by D.L. Poe**

****The failed messiah stood waist deep in the salty sea, shame burning across his features as plainly as if it had been written across his face. “How could this be,” he asked himself. He threw up his hands and screamed at the heavens, “Why hast thou forsaken me?!”

Amir bowed his head in defeat, seemingly against his will. The visions had been so plain, so real. Night after night, the Lord had come to him in his dreams with promises of supernatural abilities in exchange for leading His lost flock back to Him. It happened each night for a week. Amir had woken each morning soaked in sweat, with the sounds and smells from his visions lingering delicately upon his senses.

So Amir had donned a cloak and done his best to make them listen. He preached in the subways, on the sidewalks, even in the public restroom. All the while, he was ridiculed, spit upon, and even assaulted. This flock of people didn’t realize that he was trying to save them; they thought he was crazy.

Amir walked from the water--not on the water--and fell to his knees on the sandy shore. Shells dug into his knees and broke his skin, yet Amir felt nothing. He bowed his head and sobbed because he was too broken to care about the shame of an old man weeping in public like a scolded child.

A boy and girl of about 16 walked past, holding hands. Amir considered speaking to them, but crushing disappointment stole the words from his lips before he could speak them aloud. He looked at his trembling hands in disbelief.

Each night, the Lord came to Amir in his dreams, and each night, He made the same request. “Lead my flock back into my loving embrace. Amir, my son,” the Lord instructed him. Each night, in those dreams, Amir received a different reward for his unquestioning servitude.

The first night he’d flown, soaring through the heavens above the vast city. It was wonderful--exhilarating. With each breath and dive through the swirling air currents, he felt the Lord in every pore, elevating him.

The second night, he was granted future sight when he saw his grandchildren, and their grandchildren. He swelled with pride, and never before had he felt so grounded in his own existence.

The third night, he was a spirit able to intrude upon anything and anyone without being seen. He visited the home of his ex-wife and watched her dine with his son and daughter. He wept then, too, and the love closed over him like a warm blanket on a cold winter’s night.

The fourth night, he found himself with a super strength. He went to different parts of the world where he was needed and saved people from the rubble after an earthquake. He torn a pregnant woman from the wreckage of her car after a drunk driver ran her off the road.

The fifth and final night, he had clairaudience, the ability to focus on hearing any sound, no matter the distance. He listened as good men planned and evil men plotted. He heard things that made him sure there’d never been a more important task than the one he was given in his dreams. He became convinced that it was up to him to save mankind.

Each morning, Amir awoke feeling like a new man. Knowing mankind would depend on him and that he was chosen by the Lord, he had quite a weight upon his shoulders. He was determined not to fail in this most sanctimonious task.

Returning his thoughts to the present, Amir thought of his dismal failure of the last four days. He tried with all his might, and how he was giving up. He knew he was wrong: they were just dreams, like all men have. Amir was left with no choice but to accept his normalcy. He trudged home to change his dripping cloak and maybe grab a bite to eat. As he walked, he thought to himself, “Let the Lord find another sucker.”

Leaving the sand, Amir looked down to see a dead bluejay on the side of the road. It was the most beautiful blue with white highlights and a black feather on its wings. Surely, only the Lord could make something so flawless and perfect.

Amir couldn’t bring himself to leave the bird to rot in the gutter, and so he decided to put it in his pocket and bury it when he got home. With cupped hands, Amir gently lifted it and looked closely with awe and wonder. Its feathers were riddled with dirt, and so he began to blow upon the bird. As he blew, his warm breath over the bird, he felt a sudden, heavenly surge upon his chest. Tears began to flow from his eyes as his breath continued to flow--surely his longest exhale.

Suddenly, the Jay began to pulse in his hand, and Amir continued blowing as it twitched and stirred. His breath began to run out, yet the Jay sprang to its feet in his hands before spreading its perfect wings into flight.

Amir watched the miracle bird until it disappeared from his sight. Then he fell to his knees and wept for the second time that day.
