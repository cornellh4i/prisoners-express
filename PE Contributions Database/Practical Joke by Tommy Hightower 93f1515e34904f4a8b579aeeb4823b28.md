**"Practical Joke"** **by Tommy Hightower**

I am afraid I have never had much care for neither the practical jokers of life nor the jokes. My life and the lives of many I grew up with, was not a joke at all. It was a happy enough life for us. It was not one that lends itself to tolerance for jokers of any kind.

Children are the most inclined to do practical jokes. When adults do so, I think it's an inability to grow up, for there is a major difference between a sense of humor, and a joker. One is acceptable and good. That is having a sense of humor. I did, to an extent. But jokers and practical jokes usually were only funny to the one pulling the jokes on others. I have seen men get seriously injured from the practical jokes of others, usually due to the fact that those jokers don’t have the maturity to think out the possible danger the joke entails.

One practical joke is a case in point. The practical jokers who place firecrackers or cherry bombs in common items, as a “Practical Joke” that hurts. I’ve seen a boy of 14 or so place a cherry bomb in a banana split with a long fuse under the tablecloth, up through the bottom of the plastic dish holding the banana split. Then he called his little brother out of the house to come and see the treat his big brother got for him.

The child was maybe 5 years old. Constantly bugging big brother. Who I knew and went to school with. Me, I missed not having my small sibling with me, I have two sisters and a brother. I would have given anything to have my baby brother Donald bug me all day long. So I was all for the little brother and constantly warned the practical joker he was wrong and cruel in his philosophy. This day proved me correct, G-d forbid it. When this little boy saw this treat that his usually tormenting big brother had given him, he raced over to it and started eating it way faster than the joker had planned on. I was not in on the joke, but I was there for the aftermath. This little boy was so happy, and so into eating this treat that he was not heeding his big brother’s panic when the cherry bomb did not go off just before arrival of the little brother. The joke was to be whipped cream blowing up in his face. Instead the child snatched up and ran with the banana split, shoveling down his throat the delicious ice cream and sauce while Practical Joker was chasing him, screaming for him to stop in fear of mom and dad who previously ordered the end of all jokes on Little Brother.

By now you have guessed the aftermath. It’s exactly why cherry bombs and children never mix well. The little child had the split too close to his face. He lost an eye and a couple fingers for good measure. I was the one who had to do first aid to the child, deal with screaming Joker whom I kicked the living crap out of, several times that day and the following year. It was the parents I had the hardest time with. Dad wanting to kill, literally, the joker. Mom who could not hold it together for the sake of the baby boy who was maimed. I was 14 almost 15 and very much an adult by now, due to the life I was raised in.

I hate practical jokes. I have never cared for them and had no use for them. Now I won’t tolerate them in good humor. Practical jokes can kill. Grow up, America: humor and fun are fine. But pulling jokes on another is never okay. As I write this, Sunday 15th of November 2015, France is mourning. The world is mourning. Babies are dying in the sea when parents flew war so the child can live as an adult.

Do we really need a word prompt titled “practical jokes”? Not in this world. What we need in more thoughts about empathy, tolerance, united, one world-one people, parole day, hope for the future… Think of this: You are asking us inmates to express ourselves and upload emotions hidden far too long.

“Viva la France.” Paris we mourn with you.
