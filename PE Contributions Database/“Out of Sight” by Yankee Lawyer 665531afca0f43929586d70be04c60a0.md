**“Out of Sight” by Yankee Lawyer**

According to the Star-Spangled Banner, our “national anthem” (what could be more reliable?). This country (U.S.A.) is the “land of the free and the home of the brave.” I suspect that some of our Standing Rock neighbors have a different understanding of that phrase than Francis Scott Key’s.

When I see a picture of a mountain, I want to climb it. When I see white water, I want to grab a paddle and go but there are no canoes where I am now.

When I was a young lawyer, I kept a full backpack in the trunk of my car, a bike rack over the bumper and a rack on the roof. If I didn’t have count in the morning, I could point in any direction but east and drive. I tried to sleep outside at least one night a month.

Even those trees look inviting. Trees can be climbed, eaten, hidden behind, burned, pissed on…

Believe it or not, the North Carolina DPS Division of Adult Correction likes trees. They surround most of its prisons. They block the view so we prisoners can’t see more than a hundred yards or so beyond the fences, and the ruling class elite don’t have to look at us.

Man has ways of preventing everything he touches.
