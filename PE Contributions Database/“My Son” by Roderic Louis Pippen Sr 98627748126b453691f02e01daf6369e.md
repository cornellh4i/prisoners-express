**“My Son” by Roderic Louis Pippen Sr.**

My son, Roderic Louis Pippen Jr., born May 25, 2009. The first time I was able to see you in person was August 14, 2009. As I held you for the first time, we locked eyes and I knew I would do anything for you. I spoke no words and our family sat in silence. Until you finally smiled and I was able to smile back. The moment was perfect although our lives would never be.

That night as I laid in my bunk, in my thoughts I was able to identify a plan to get home to you. The next day when visiting was allowed my name was called. Prisoner Pippen report, you have a visit. Fellow prisoners wished me well, as visits were hard to come by in that facility. But our family drove 9 hours and stayed the weekend up in Wasaga, Michigan. So that you could visit me at Baraga Maximum Correctional Facility.

This time when I entered the visiting area you were drinking a bottle wrapped in a blanket my mother made you. After I hugged everyone, I sat down. And for the second time, I held you in my hands. As you drank your bottle your eyes spoke to me. You told me that you needed me, and I knew then at 22 years old I was only living for you.

At the end of our visit, I felt a pain I never knew I could. I held a firm grip on my emotions, but you are mine. And I never wanted to let you go. And the reality was I had to, and I had no other choice. I kissed your forehead like I always do, and handed you to your mom. As we said our goodbyes I held on to your feet. And I promised your mom I would always take care of you.

That night, back in my bunk, I cried in frustration. Cause I had 20 months left on my minimum sentence. And no guarantee that I would be given parole. With my mind made up, I vowed to make it home as soon as possible. But I never knew how hard my past made our future.

Two weeks later I was transferred to 6 Robert Cotton Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan. It was an hour away from Detroit, which meant I would see you more. But at a steep cost, I was charged with four homicides. And I would now risk never seeing you outside of prison.

Over the next 18 months, I was able to see you every two weeks. As we hoped for the best and prepared for the worst. But I had a parole hearing and was given an additional 24 months. The good news was the homicide case was dropped for a lack of evidence. And I was given a release date.

December 20, 2012, I got released on parole. That night you had a big present wrapped from your dad. A video shows you ripping at wrapping paper as a toy makes the noise inside. Before you could get the box open, I jumped out to your surprise. It’s my Da-Dais all you screamed as you hugged my neck.

Until October 2, 2013, we were together almost every day. But the U.S. Marshalls surrounded our house with a warrant for my arrest. I surrendered and they allowed me to sit down with you. This conversation would be the last time I held you outside of prison.

On our monthly visits now we talk to the man. And we are back where we began. With my holding you in a prison visiting room, vowing to do anything to get back to you.
