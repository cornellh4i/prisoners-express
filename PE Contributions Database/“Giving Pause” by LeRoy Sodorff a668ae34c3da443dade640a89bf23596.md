**“Giving Pause” by LeRoy Sodorff**

Two southpaws

Give pause

In a very left-handed way

To an old friend on the mend.

Showing concern

They both take a turn

With a sudden itch

One scratches the old man’s back

The other bellies-up in his lap.

Now they travel about

Throughout the south and seek refuge from life’s storms

In places off-beat

And those shelters off the streets.
