**“Thankful” by Marcus Denson**

Thankful is a common word, but it is hardly used. For a long time, I didn’t fully understand the meaning of thankful, and how receiving and giving thanks would make a difference on myself and the world.

Before I became a man of God and understood the value of me and who I was, thankful wasn’t even in my everyday life.

I am thankful for the opportunity to wake up another day on this earth. I am thankful to have my health. I am thankful for my strong mind. I am thankful for my good looks. I am thankful for being a genius. I am thankful for my wonderful smile. I am thankful for my strong will power. I am thankful for my wisdom. I am thankful for my power of attraction. I am thankful for my strength to adapt to any situation. I am thankful to have a big family. I am thankful to know how to write music. I am thankful to know how to read. I am thankful to know how to write. I am thankful to know how to sing. I am thankful to know how to rap. I am thankful to know how to draw. I am thankful to know how to uplift people. I am thankful to have communication skills. I am thankful to know how to dance. And I am thankful for being a child of God.

There are millions of people who aren’t so lucky, blessed, or thankful, to wake up and be in great health and shape. Strong mind, good looks, and everything I’ve stated above. Opening up my mind, maturing and seeing the world through a clear and sound mind helped me to define “thankful”.
