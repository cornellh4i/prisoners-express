**“Girl Looking Through Window” by Lance Szady**

“I’m looking at you through the glass; don’t how much time has passed, oh god, it feels like forever. But no one tells you that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head”.

Over the Manhattan skyline, looking down at the chaos of city life. While nestled in a cocoon of tranquility, high up in her apartment. Her petite body shows a relaxed composure sitting with legs bent, arms out, hands resting on knees. Time slows for this woman in her thoughts as life is speeding by below. The quiet of her apartment a stark contrast to the noise of a metropolis. What’s not seen are the musings and contemplations of this lovely woman. Was she just taking a few minutes out of a hectic day? To enjoy a minute of solitude and escape the stress of a busy schedule? Was her heart broken by an uncaring man, and now she’s reflecting on where she went wrong and how to pick up the pieces? Is she new to the city with loved ones far away but close to her heart? Wondering if the choices that led to this window sill overlooking the cityscape were the best for her future? Maybe it’s as simple as she enjoys watching the everyday movements of people going about their business. Or the beauty of a summer day with the fluffy white clouds drifting across the vibrant blue sky. One thing for sure: we will never know the thoughts deep inside the woman's mind. We can only speculate on her body language. That’s the beauty of what separates us from animals. The ability to think and feel outside the basic needs of survival. Also without choice, what emotions and thoughts we project to the outside world. “Thoughts of a solitary woman” Looking through the glass -- Stone Sour
