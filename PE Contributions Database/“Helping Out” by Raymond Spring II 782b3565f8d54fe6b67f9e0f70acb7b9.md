**“Helping Out” by Raymond Spring II**

Conscious and Concerned Readers,

This is the first of many pop-up news ads from your prison prophet who is in desperate need of personal and general advocates that are willing to use their voices, contacts, phones, fax machines and written complaint abilities to help me create prosocial and positive changes for California State prisoners like myself who work hard on rehabilitating Self from Death Culture to Compassionate & Civilized Culture. Knowing that unless you and those strong, beautiful and compassionate supporters of change work together, I will get out in four years worse than I entered the prison system a decade ago. I want every reader to understand that no person is righteously judged in total by their worst action. People who fully believe in the power and process of both redemption and forgiveness, contact me through U.S. mail or Email using Pay.com’s free to download application using my name, CDCR#, address, etc.which I will provide last….

But first let me tell you the reason I’m in need of advocates and how this will assist the larger prison population. At this moment I’m being held at CSATF/State Prison at Corcoran, in California Kings County. I’m on the Ecko facility on a level three yard geared towards youth offender programs, which I don’t qualify for in any case. This environment is being racialized by the Correctional Staff at every level through the creation of a prison caste system based upon race/ethnicity with Latinos at the top and Asiatic New African Americans at the bottom. If you are saying how, that’s great because it means you’re paying attention. The answer is by giving Latinos 90% of all the lead position jobs, placing Latino prisoners in self help, education, vocational training at a rate four times that of Asiatic New Africans imprisoned at this facility. They are clearly not operating by the rules, regulations, or policies explained thoroughly inside the Department Operations Manual, California Penal Code, and the Title 15’s rules and regulations, which all stipulate Ethnic Balance must or shall be maintained. This is not happening here on Ecko facility by the Assignment Lieutenant nor the direct supervisors of the prisoners with jobs. This is easily seen by the fact that not one Asiatic New African (Black) prisoner has a job in the Law Library, Canteen and CTC. Less than 7% are working in the PIA positions and they have no lead positions in the kitchen where I have worked for over three months without a raise. At this time I’m being refused my quarterly work progress report from my direct Supervisor, who is overtly bias towards me based on race and ethnicity, being a Asiatic/Hebrew Israelite of the Beta Israel stock. Upon my arrival on 9-11-18 at CSATF, Ecko yard she denied me my Kosher meal 37 days straight even after I presented my Kosher Meal Diet Card everyday. This continues to create a hostile work environment for me due to having deliberate, indifferent, unequal treatment and a low level of professionalism on her part on a daily basis. This is just one of my issues you’ll be helping out with, would you choose to become my advocate.

Another huge issue is the fact that this whole yard is uninhabitable due to the ceiling leaks in every building and in the majority of cells in each building each and every time it rains. I continue to wake up early in the morning just to use towels and blankets as mops to get the water up off of the cell floor. This is double true for the Dining Halls where the ceiling towels are falling due to the rain water pouring through the roof. The fact that this filthy water is falling directly on trays prisoners will have to eat off of doesn’t raise concern from any of the staff members who work on this yard. Even the gymnasium is constantly flooding due to these twelve conditions.

My name is Raymond Springs II. I’m a jailhouse lawyer, a political prisoner, political writer for Under Lock and Key, a representative of the Nation of God and Earths on the 5%ers, a son of the Black Panthers, a college student, an organizer, a Civilization Class Facilitator and so much more. To contact me please write me at: Raymond Spring II, CDC# G49457, PO 5242, Corcoran, Ca. 93212 or email using gray.com and you can learn more about me via: [level4ss@yahoo.com](mailto:level4ss@yahoo.com)

This is a conclusion of the first pop-up news add of the “Helping Out” series.

Peace for now!
