**“Confused, Rattled and Embarrassed” by Rodney Gabriel**

In the summer of 2004 I had just turned the ripe age of fourteen. Still green, from living a quarantined lifestyle with my moms, I felt like a wild wolf being released back into its habitat; after learning that I was moving in with my uncle.

Once there it was like taking an adventure through a concrete jungle. Everything that I used to see on TV and in movies, I sought out. From older women, weed, alcohol, gambling, gangs etc...So in no time I discovered that my uncle was in fact peddling crack cocaine. One morning as I was bustling, trying to get to my daily rituals, he stopped me. “Say nephew, I need you to handle something for me, real quick.”

“Alright unc, how long is it going to take?” I asked in a hurry. Unable to use his limbs, due to a near fatal car crash, he basically ignored me and nodded over to a desk with his chin.

“Grab that plate and razor!” He barked. In the beginning I was nervous, AKA (Busting your girl’s cherry) but as the time passed by, so did my skills began improving. So after that day, when there would be someone more equipped to handle the hands on training, I would still be front and center (For safe measures, of course). With all of the free training, it was only natural for me to go into business for myself (Or something like that). At night, while everyone was asleep or busy I would crawl into my uncle’s room, locate his stash and pilfer just enough product to pay for my newfound habits. Then get down the street to where numerous dope fiends hung out and trade in for money.

After that first time, everywhere I went in the neighborhood smokers hit me up.

“Say youngsta, you working?” I mean, it got so common I felt as though “youngsta” were in fact my personal nickname.That is, until I ran across two real d-boys. As the three of us sat posted up, a white Lexus cruised up and hollered out, “Say youngsta you working?” I got up just as the other two vacated their seats, we looked at one another, then took off to the car. The fastest one got the money while me and the other dude stood off to the side. On his way back from custo AKA customer, I confronted him, “Say cuz, why you step on my toes, I know you heard her calling me!” Older, bigger and way more experienced, he could’ve pulverized me, instead he stood merely befuddled.

“What?” He asked.

So I told him, “Yeah, she hollered out ‘youngsta’, that’s my name!”

Before I could continue on with my rant, him and his homeboy busted out laughing. In between their laughter I got a few words in, “Shit, go and ask the rest of the smokers, they call me youngsta too!” Calming down, he told me, “Say lil’ homie, they call anyone younger than they are youngsta, and especially if they got dope.” Dumbstruck, I glanced over at the dope fiends and thought about going over there to help make my point, until one came over to us and asked a boy that was talking to me for some dope.

“Say youngsta, let me get a wake up. I got you when this trick pull up.”

Both sets of eyes crept directly on me, as if they were saying “I told you.”
