**by Sarah Luedecke**

I’ve been called many things. I am all of these things and none of these. I’ve been called “Solo,” “Frost,” “Eden,” “Sara Jane,” “Halliana,” “Monster,” “Dangerous,” “Worthless,” “Embarrassing,” “Lifeless”. So many people assume at first glance the lack of emotion etched upon my tattooed face is the way that I am. Actually, I would say this is true. I don’t go out of my way to make myself unapproachable, just I prefer not holding the normal conversation people are so very attracted to. Of course what moves me doesn’t exist in a world where lies are the foundation for life and plastic is the depth of a person.

No one knows my passion for baking, cooking, or writing. I even have a manuscript that is fantasy, unpublished. I attend college and despite my enjoyment of learning I struggle to pass. Not because I’m not intelligent. Being intelligent is by far one of the common compliments I receive, but because I have Asperger’s Syndrome. Stack that on to the PTSD I developed in not only the military but before that from numerous traumatic experiences. Yet I have nothing to date that I have accomplished I would say I am proud of! Not in myself!

I have three boys, Thor, Loki, and Ryo, who are all three my greatest and best accomplishment to date. However, I’ll never be able to tell them because my nicknames are who I continue to be labeled as. Maybe one day I’ll have nicknames like “mother,” “lover,” “wife,” “author,” “baker,” “spouse,” “brilliant,” “loving,” “forgiven,” and “understood.” Until then I strive to exceed everyone’s expectations and make progress each and every day.
