Everyone’s been lost, right? Whether it’s something insignificant like a pen (which my cellmate is always losing in a 6x10 cell--incredible, right?) or something meaningful like your wedding ring. Others have lost relationships. Some have lost their jobs, their savings, their beliefs, and even their minds! While some lost things are lost forever, others appear unexpectedly. My first sense of the word “lost” came in the first grade with the death of my father who was beyond the reach of attainment; he was lost forever. The second time this word altered my life was at age 16 when another family lost their father by my actions and I, in turn, lost my freedom. This weighed heavy in my heart because I knew what this family felt like having lost my own father at an early age. There are no words God could’ve told me at the time he took my father that would’ve made me feel any better, so what words could I have said at the time that would’ve made a difference? When the judge asked me if I had anything to say for my actions, I responded no. I immediately regretted my response and knew that I lost my opportunity to ask for their forgiveness and to tell his family how remorseful I felt for their loss. I still feel remorse for what occurred that day, and I apologize dearly to the family of the man who lost his life. I feel like my words would be lost to their ears. I know not where they are or who they are, and so only God knows if my plea for their forgiveness is something that I’ll be able to find an answer to, or if my cry is beyond reach and forever lost.
