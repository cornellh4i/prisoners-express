**“Thankful” by Stan Moore**

On July 18, 2014, I was arrested and put in jail after a lying client claimed that I had threatened his life. I was convicted at a trial where my paid attorney failed inexplicably to mount a defence. I was sentenced to thirteen years in state prison for crimes I did not commit. For this, I am now thankful.

I was definitely not thankful at first for this situation. I was bitter, depressed and entertaining suicidal thoughts. I brooded, moped, despaired. I dwelled constantly on all the things I was missing-freedom, comfort, friend, work, wild nature, good food, etc.

But prison motivated me to do a lot of soul searching. Why was this happening to me? I started reading all the self-help books I could find. I explored Buddhism, meditation, universal laws, Hindu texts and all sorts of guidance. And I began to be thankful.

So, at age 58, I learned to accept responsibility for all my thoughts, words and deeds. I learned from Buddhism that happiness must come from within and not be dependent on one’s circumstances. I recognized that circumstances are constantly subject to change, and that pining one’s hopes and happiness on things subject to change is an exercise in perpetual futility and frustration. I learned that attachments to sensual pleasures are a trap, as is a version based on ego. How thankful I am to have received this knowledge!

And I am thankful to know now that pleasure without ego-driven attachment is not a problem. So, even in prison, I have many things I can enjoy and be thankful for, without the trap of unhealthy attachment.

I can name many little things I am thankful for almost every day in prison. I am at CML West on the central California coast. The weather is mild and variable. I live in a dormitory whose doors are never locked. The prison yard I live in has picnic tables under shade trees and beautiful views of surrounding hills through chain link fences. There are beautiful landscape plantings all around with lovely flowers, caci and even places for inmates to grow food items such as tomatoes, peppers, cantaloupes, etc.

I am thankful that my prison yard has domestic cats-two of which are my daily friends and comforters. We have birds all around the yard. I am thankful for the raccoons and the wild turkeys that live around us. We even have resident Red-tailed Hawks, and I have seen Cooper’s Hawks, Peregrine Falcons and even Golden Eagles overhead! I am a raptor fanatic and licensed raptor breeder, so these raptor sightings on a regular basis are something I am extremely thankful for.

I am also thankful for ongoing support of my friends who write letters, send books and send money occasionally. This support keeps me going.

These are so many blessings that I have now that I never would have had it not for this prison experience. I live in close proximity with all sorts of people of races and backgrounds I would have never encountered in my home in Marin County CA. And when the undesirable circumstances arise, I am learning to deal with them with equanimity.

So much to be thankful for now. But if I am released on appeal, I will be even more thankful.
