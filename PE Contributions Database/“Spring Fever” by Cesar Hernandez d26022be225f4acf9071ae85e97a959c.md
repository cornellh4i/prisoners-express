**“Spring Fever” by Cesar Hernandez**

Peggy commits suicide when my friend breaks up with her. My friend was with Peggy for about nine months. Right from the start, I tell him Peggy is crazy and that he needs to get rid of her. I can’t understand what he sees in her. He goes from Lisa who’s a nine to Peggy who’s a six.

Right from the start, you can tell Peggy is crazy. She’s very clingy. She’s always calling and texting him to see what he is up to. I keep telling him to get rid of her, but he won’t. Peggy is always leaving notes everywhere. He opens every cabinet and there is a note from Peggy. All his clothes have notes from Peggy in the pockets.

Peggy gets even more crazy when she drinks wine. She keeps thinking my friend is hiding something from her. She keeps asking my friend for a spare key to his house. He finally gives her a key. He gets home and sees that his entire house has been searched. Everything is slightly out of place. I tell him Peggy probably put in hidden cameras to keep tabs on him.

Peggy buys a house three blocks away. My friend finds out when she tells him to help her move into her house. I tell my friend now he’s stuck with Peggy. She’s just down the street and is going to constantly monitor him. He keeps denying she’s crazy.

My friend is in his pool. He gets the sense someone’s watching him. He looks toward the back fence and is almost positive he sees Peggy watching him. He even yells Peggy. She stays quiet. He runs to her house. She opens the door and she’s out of breath. She obviously just ran home. He asks her why she’s all out of breath. She says she was on the treadmill. He looks over at the clothes covering the treadmill.

My friend is doing yard work. He thinks he sees Peggy’s car pass slowly. He goes inside and stands at the window. He sees Peggy’s car keep passing by his house. Peggy is driving in circles keeping an eye on his house.

My friend decides enough is enough. Spring break is coming up. He is not taking Peggy on vacation. He breaks up with her. Peggy is not taking no for an answer. She keeps trying to get my friend back. He says no.

My friend is in his pool. Peggy sends him a text and also leaves a voicemail. My friend sees it about twenty minutes later. Peggy says she went to CVS and bought a lot of pills. She says she can’t go on and is committing suicide. My friend is unsure. Peggy is probably just being crazy. He listens to the voicemail. Peggy is very groggy. She did take lots of pills. He calls 911 and drives over. He has no key so he kicks down the door.

Peggy is passed out on the living room floor. Her breathing is very shallow. The EMTs arrive and take her to the hospital. She dies in the ambulance.

Peggy’s funeral is very sad. No one is surprised she committed suicide. Everybody knows she’s crazy. Her parents are the only ones in denial. Peggy was only about twenty-five and just starting her career.
