**“Two Pennies” by Mark P. Sandfox**

****It was early, the sun just lighting the sky, not that Sally could see the sun through all of this fog. Barefoot as usual, they didn’t call her Barefoot Sally for no reason, Sally trekked through the scrub next to the railroad tracks. Normally her Pete, never call him Peter – he hated that name –would carry her piggyback style over all the jagged rocks, then place her gentle-like on one of the rails so she wouldn’t hurt her feet. Everyone teased her at school, said she was poor, a pauper, told her she would be a good beggar, said she was hard up, penniless, but not today. Sally had found two pennies yesterday, so she wanted to do something special for her Pete.

Pete thought she was grand. Sally thought he was cute. Her mom said she was too young to have a boyfriend, and kissing was out of the question. So Pete and Sally were just friends, but they were the best of friends. He taught her how to bait her own hook. They went critter hunting like all the time; they never killed anything, they just held their catch and looked at it. He even let Sally help him with his homework.

Barefoot Sally pushed through the scrub of the forest, searching for the plank of wood she saw the other day. The fog was thick, even in the forest, the air deafening quiet like a muffled hush. A few more steps and she found her prize. With grunts and groans Barefoot Sally dragged the plank to the edge of the jagged rocks, then tipped it upright and let it fall over the rocks up to the tracks. Arms spread wide, Sally tight-wired up the plank to the first rail. It was easy peasy, the plank was much wider than the rail.

Pete was not there to hold her hand, which caused her to hesitate before stepping onto the smooth steel rail. Cold steel met the bottom of her foot with a tingle. She was on her own today, well at least this morning. They were to meet later at their favorite spot. Sally was going to kiss him today, right after she gave him the smashed pennies, one for him, one for her. Sally blushed, her cheeks trying to match her fiery red hair. One bare foot in front of the other, bare arms stretched out wide for balance, Sally teetered and tottered her way down the railroad tracks.

Sally wore Pete’s favorite outfit, a crop top and short shorts, her sister had a bathing suit that covered more skin, but Pete thought her exposed belly button was the sexiest thing ever. At school she wore ratty jeans and hand-me-down blouses, and still Pete had eyes only for her. Sally hugged her naked abs, nearly lost her balance, her heart skipping a beat as her arms cartwheeled out to counter a harsh teeter.

A horn blared from deep within the fog.

“Train!” yipped Sally.

Sally squeezed her fingers into her tiny pocket, fishing out the two pennies. Her balance was all over the place, hopping on toes, kicking out a bare leg, then correcting the mayhem with arms cartwheeling out wide,

The horn wailed again, closer this time, a glint of its headlight peeking through the fog...really close.

Sally squeaked. Icy adrenaline raced through her veins, her fingers and toes tingled. She needed to hurry. She squatted down, one bare foot and leg extended for balance, placed the two pennies on the cold steel rail, just in front of her painted toenails.

The ground began to shake.

Barefoot Sally stood back up. She was stranded. She couldn’t walk across the jagged rocks, she needed to hurry back to the plank. Sally gave her pennies a farewell glance before she turned tail to run down the rail. The pennies were shaking just like the rail.

The horn blared again, frightfully loud. Sally looked up just as the engine burst free of the fog. The horn blared again, not short like before, long and distressful. Sally stared at the racing train, blank, empty, confused. The screeching of steel wheels on steel rails rose above the constant blaring horn. The vibrations tickled her bare feet.

A tear trickled down her cheek. She would never get to kiss...
