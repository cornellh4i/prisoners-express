**“Blues Night” by Jack Simpson**

Friday night at the House of Blues. I love the sound of a sax player. How it rumbles low and hits notes, just on time. Over the years, I’ve met people of all traits. Most wanted the same thing. To cut one short is not in me. I love a good blues song.

Tonight I had been sitting and humming to the tunes. Went here before but made no connection.

“Are you here with someone?” he asked. “May I sit down and talk with you?” he went on to add.

“By all means sit down,” I said. He thanked me for the kindness.

“My name is ‘Tyrone’,” he said. “I have seen you coming in here for a while. You really have a rhythm for the music. So you like the blues.”

“Oh yes, who wouldn’t enjoy the sound of all the instruments bringing the temp on time. It sounds like you have studied music in the past.”

“Excuse me Mr. Tyrone. Here is the drink you ordered.”

“Bring the lady what she wants. Sparkling water for me please.”

“Yes ma’am.”

The waiter left to return with the glass of preferred drink. She thanked him and he returned to his duties.

“Mr. Tyrone,” she said,'' What is it that I can help you with? I do enjoy the music and being here. Most of all it is where I can be myself. Not everyone has the rhythm.”

“What is your name?” he asked.

“ My name is Shondra. My mother named me after her auntie.”

“That is so wonderful. My name is Tyrone Williams. I own the club and presently I am looking for a singer. One who can bring in a crowd and bring the house down. How would you like to try for a chance to have a career? The pay isn't much to start with. I believe you have what it takes to make it happen.”

“Can I think about it this weekend? By at least next Friday, I can give you an answer. I would feel more relaxed if not pushed into it too fast.”

“Then, Shondra, can we have a small sample of your voice? I don’t see why not.” She got up from her chair. The stage was less than 20 feet. Tyrone motioned for the bartender to have the band set up. Once Shondra was on stage, she turned to the band. With a count of three, the music started to play. Out of her mouth flowed the slow sweetest sound of soul you would ever want to hear. The bartender was wiping his eyes. Tyrone was whimpering like a baby. For once in his life, her voice tore deep into the soul. The men at the bar were shedding tears. One man had to leave; he was so touched that he left a ten spot (ten dollars) in a mason jar for the singer.

Once she had finished the song she headed back to the table. Tyrone was still wiping his eyes. The men in the band were clapping their hands in approval.

Tyrone pulled her chair out to seat her.

“You're the best this place could offer as a singer,” he said.

“You’re just being kind.” she said. “I’m not that good.”

“ Look around you and see for yourself.” Slowly the clapping subsided.

Shondra sat with her left hand under her. She had such an incredible voice. Tyrone sat waiting for an answer. He had seen a soul singer who could rock the house of blues. She not only would bring in a profit, it would also help launch her career. Shondra not only accepted his offer, she went home that night a hundred dollars richer from the mason jar. Tyrone had agreed to pay no less than 250 for the first weekend plus tips in the jar.

Her career was heading up since not only because of Tyrone. A young man who sat in the audience in the audience on blues night gave her his card for the real House of Blues.
