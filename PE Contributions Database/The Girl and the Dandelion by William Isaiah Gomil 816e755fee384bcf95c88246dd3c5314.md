**The Girl and the Dandelion by William Isaiah Gomillion**

Beauty! Pure, simple beauty! While no details may be clear, they are not needed. We know what we see, the innocence, the perfection, the Forbidden. She is perfect, the small up turned nose, slightly parted lips as if she is about to blow on the flower. She admires it as we admire her. The hint of a small smooth shoulder as she leans forward hands on knees. Long flowing hair that to me is as red as fire, but to you may be shiny black or white blond. The way it hangs down hiding any hint of breast or the absence of. The smooth curve of her back and small tummy only outlined by her nightgown, dress, robe? Small hips only start to show what will be in time. The smooth roundness of her small bottom straining against the cloth. Strong thighs on her small frame making me think of her running and playing. Who is she? Woman, child? Elf, fairy, princess, mother, daughter, lover, dreamer? Where is she? In your dreams, in the woods, at home? Beauty! Pure, simple beauty! Unoffending, innocent, perfect, forbidden!
