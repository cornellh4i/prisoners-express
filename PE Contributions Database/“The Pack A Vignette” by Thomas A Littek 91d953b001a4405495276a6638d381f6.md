**“The Pack: A Vignette” by Thomas A. Littek**

In the early morning hours of an early spring day in the rugged backcountry of Northern Maine, the great grey wolf stirs, rises, surveys the still-sleeping pack, and driven by hunger, heads out in search of game. She’s in her seventeenth year, and although weary and somewhat slower than she used to be, she rules the pack. She is the uncontested alpha wolf.

Slowly, the old wolf makes her way through the dense dark woods to a clearing that offers a bird’s eye view of the landscape below. The air is cold, crisp and clear, and from her vantage point high above the valley floor, the wolf can see for miles. As the morning sun, still low in the sky, climbs slowly higher, the only sounds are water drops that splash to earth as the winter ice reluctantly recedes from the alpine forest.

The old wolf, a clever and accomplished hunter, tucks herelf into a thicket of tall grass and saplings; her sharp yellow eyes sweep the land in search of prey. Off in the distance she spots a small group of whitetail deer, grazing, completely oblivious of the wolf’s presence.

In turn, the wolf carefully considers each deer in the group. There’s one old buck with huge dangerous antlers; two yearlings, each with tiny spike horns; and three rather large does, one of which favors an injured leg. That’s the one the shrewd old wolf thinks to herself. She knows the pack; she knows each one’s strengths and weaknesses. They are, after all, her family. She taught them to hunt, to kill. They are fearless, skilled and efficient hunters - a well-oiled killing machine. The wolf knows the pack can easily cull the lame doe with little risk to themselves. She withdraws back into the woods, off to summon her troops.

Suddenly, silently, the pack appears at the wood’s edge, poised, like a band of proud and noble-spirited warriors standing watch over their sacred mountain realm. The muted black, brown and grey fur of their coats blend perfectly with the ambient terrain, making the wolves all but invisible to the unsuspecting deer below.

On cue, like a well-honed military team, the wolves deploy. Down the hill by degrees, some fan left, others fan right to form an inconspicuous noose around the still-browsing herd. The old matriarch shifts nervously from foot to foot as the ambush unfolds; a slight wag of her tail signals her approval of the pack’s tactics. To and fro, the wolves trot gradually tightening the noose around the deer.

The wolves’ bodies are long and lean, sturdy and powerful; their eyes are alert and keen, and show intelligence. These are living demons.

Step-by-step, the attack develops. Then, in a flash, with savage speed and terror, the kill is on. The deer never see it coming.
