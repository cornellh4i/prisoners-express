When life gives you Bodyguards make them open doors.

The first time I flew out of McCarran International Airport I had two bodyguards with me. When you fly with bodyguards all the doors open for you. We were running late. The hotel checkout process had been slow. Traffic on Paradise Road was bumper to numper. We had no idea if we would make it to the plane.

As soon as we walked into the airport, one of my bodyguards went up to the American Airlines First Class desk. In less than 5 minutes we had our boarding passes. We were rushing through the huge airport. When we got to the security lane there were easily one hundred people in line. My bodyguard directed us to the side. On the side there was the handicapped lane. It only had about ten people in line. My bodyguard went to the side desk and signed the VIP log. We walked behind the desk. Our security check was non-existent

Our original plan was to get lunch as a casual sit-down restaurant in the airport. Since we were running late our plan changed to Burger King. One of my bodyguards ran up to Burger King while my other bodyguard and I proceeded to check in at the gate. We are told that the plane was two hours delayed.

My bodyguard and I rush to Burger King to cancel the food order. My other bodyguard already got all the food. He skipped the thirty people in line and got our food first.

When the plane finally arrives we are the first ones to board. One of my bodyguards talked to the Captain. Right before takeoff the captain announces that instead of going the usual 520 miles per hour we will be going 600 miles per hour to try and make up some time. If the plane had been on schedule it would have been completely possible to walk in the airport and fifteen minutes later to be on the plane.

Thankfully there were no annoying crying kids on the plane. However there was an annoying adult across the aisle. It was her first time flying and it seemed like she was going to be sick. When they passed out snacks we got a whole muffin and a whole soda. The other passengers only got half a muffin and half a soda. When we landed my bodyguards and I were first to get off the plane.
