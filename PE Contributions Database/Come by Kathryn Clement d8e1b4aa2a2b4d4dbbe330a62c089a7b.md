***Come* by Kathryn Clement**

“Come, all you who are laden and heavy-laden. Come and let me give you rest,” says Jesus in Matthew 11:28-30.

“I am knocking at the door of your heart. Come and open it to let me in,” says the Lord Jesus in Revelation 3:20.

“Come to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Come those that don’t have monies to buy bread or water. Come, it is a free gift when you believe, confess in your heart and with your mouth that I am your Lord and Savior.” It is written Isaiah 55:1, John 3:16, Romans 10:0-10, Ephesians 2:8-9.

“Come to me and I will baptize you in the name of the Father, Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, and teach, counsel, help, be your standby, intercessor through the journey in this age.” Matthew 28:18-20, John 14:26, 15:26, 16:13.

Come, my children, let’s have a banquet of love and spend eternity together.
