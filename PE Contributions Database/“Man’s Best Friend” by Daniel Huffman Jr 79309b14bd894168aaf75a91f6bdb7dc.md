**“Man’s Best Friend” by Daniel Huffman Jr.**

“What’s that Grandpaw?” I asked on a summer day

“Your birthday gift” was all he had to say

“Grandpaw, he’s mine” I said with joy

He said, “You’re becoming a man and you’re no longer a boy.”

I rubbed the dog from end to end

I declared “He will be my best friend!”

I couldn’t hold my tongue, nor could I hide my excitement I fear

Neither could I hold back a single tear

I cried out “I don’t mean to be an attention hog!”

That was the year my Grandpaw bought me a seeing eye dog
