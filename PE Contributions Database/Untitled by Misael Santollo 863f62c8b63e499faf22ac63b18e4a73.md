**Untitled by Misael Santollo**

The first time that I came here, I felt lost, confused, angry and did not even know why!

That first time tears streamed down my face. I cried my soul out. I shut the whole world out.

That’s when I heard it. It was barely a whisper, but it was there.

The water spoke to me. It said to let it wash away my ugliness and filth, my shame and my pain, so that I can be transparent and pure.

The mountains told me to be upright, to stand tall and strong and I’ll be able to see the beauty of the world.

The wind told me to remove the shackles I placed on myself. Fear, Anger, Hate, Envy, Greed… These are only heavy because I give them life. Open your eyes! Drop them and be free.

Now, I sit again, but now, I’m pure, tall and free. I’m thanking my friends for speaking to me. They jokingly rebuke me and say, “All you had to do was listen. We’ve been calling you for your whole life.”
