**My Body by Mr. Dominique Lavance Givens**

From the microscopic amoeba

to the twisting chain of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),

I’m built up of the highest mathematics-scientific calculators can’t even begin to compute it.

My atoms, neutrons, and protons, like the sun, moon, and earth, is an organized physical system-heavenly bodies, and bodies in general are subjected to mathematical laws.

My genes, chromosomes, and my genome, tell the story that has went untold - I am who I am.

When I'm in need of somebody, I make a pilgrimage to the mirror where I'm always overcome with a perfect peace and understanding in the presence of supreme divine perfection - let’s not forget who I'm made in the image of.

Within my fingerprints lies the same spirals also seen in the ocean waves - not to mention in the formation of galaxies.

My body and spirit represent and resonate with the power of God - the sun, moon, and stars are my siblings. So even while peering through a telescope at the family, I can never feel small - my body is the universe’s way of becoming conscious of itself. PEACE.
