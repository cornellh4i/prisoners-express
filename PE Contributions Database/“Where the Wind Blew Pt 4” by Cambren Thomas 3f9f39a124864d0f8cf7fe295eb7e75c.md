**“Where the Wind Blew Pt 4” by Cambren Thomas**

This was my only day off this week, and all I wanted to do was catch a couple morning talk shows. But no, I had to keep being reminded by the breaking news that there was a prison escape at Stone Hill Correctional. That wasn’t really *too* far from here...but who cares. I was safe and sound in my cozy little country remodel; lounging in Minnie Mouse jammies, and sipping a mocha latte with a healthy smidge of peppermint schnapps in it. I had my handy-dandy remote too, and was desperately trying to evade the repetitive reports.

I was finally ready to retreat to Netflix when I happened to spot a name in the scrolling news feed. *Matthew Caine*...no way! I remember I was almost Melissa *Caine* once, but that was almost a decade ago - before Matt chose his criminal career over me..and the son he never officially knew was on the way. A grainy mugshot plastered my television screen next - it was definitely Matt, just with more beard and beefiness than I remembered. I turned the volume up. Some older detective guy was saying something about Matt mysteriously escaping last night, but he seemed troubled and was super sketchy with the details, like Matt just up and flew out of the gates or something.

I felt a shiver make its way up the length of my spine - *What if he comes here*? He *had* been to my grandma’s old property before. I shot up to check the locks on the front door and the back patio; snug and secure as always. I laughed at myself or overreacting, but I still felt sort of uneasy. *Maybe I should go get Adam?*

I grabbed my “special” latte, threw on my face some decent clothes and a windbreaker, pulled my .22 from the closet lockbox, nad dashed outside to my wine-red Nissan Rogue. I paused for a sec as I noticed the wind picking up in the distance, and a fall leaf twirling down to land on my windshield. Was it an omen? I hopped in my car anxiously, and started it, while simultaneously fumble-dialing Adam’s elementary school number. A random office clerk answered, and I made up a believable story about a forgotten doctor’s appointment.

Adam was waiting for me on the school’s front steps; backpack between his knees, a comic book in his hands, his curly shag fanning away from his handsome little face in the breeze - he kind of reminded me of his father. I downed another gulp of *minty* mocha on that thought. Adam’s smile lit up when he noticed me and ran to the car.

He opened the door with “Hey mom, I didn’t know I had to go back to the doctor already. My new inhaler’s been working fine.”

He hopped into the passenger seat, and I gave him a playful pinch as he buckled his seatbelt.

“*Well* son, I may have told a little fib just to get you out of school..and if you can keep it a secret, I am willing to offer you a bribe.”

He looked up curiously.

I continued, “All-you-can-eat pizza, an IMAX 3D movie, then maybe froyo and a trip to the science museum. Deal?”

That *definitely* got his attention.

“Seriously?”

Now I was reeling him in.

“*For sure.*”

I gave him my most immaculately persuasive smile.

“Sweet! What’s the occasion? You sell another house? My friends are always saying how *hot* you look on your new realtor billboards...it’s really getting annoying.”

So *I* was the *hot mom* now!? The schnapps had me giggling and blushing inside, but I had to focus and close the deal.

“There’s no real occasion *Add*...I guess I just..missed you. We can dub today *Awesome Son Appreciation Day*, if you want to jazz it up a bit.”

*That* did it. His smile was broad and bright now.

“Works for me mom! Can I get some new comics too!?”

Those were reasonable closing costs.

“Done!”

I left the school lot feeling relieved. Adam had already turned back to the color-splashed pages of his epic superhero battles. Out on the main highway, as I passed one of my apparently “popular” realty company billboards, I felt a squirrely wind gust push against my Rogue - weird, why did it make me think of Matt again. He was out and about in the free world somewhere, but what was his motive now? I hoped and prayed it wasn’t me.
