Fear… the heart races, sweat comes out from everywhere, and some get that feeling in their stomach like you get when on a roller coaster. Fear can make a person do untold things or freeze them where they can’t do anything at all.

Some people say it’s best to face your fear head on, but really it’s about the fear. Like me, I’m semi-afraid of physical altercation. I fear I’ll get my teeth knocked out. But facing this fear, what would I really benefit? I believe facing that fear head on would be counterproductive of my current cause/goal. Besides, I have nothing to prove. I don’t talk big shit like I’m a badass. I like to think of myself as an intellectual.

Now I really don’t fear heights, but I remember one day at this creek… I’m with my friend and her kid, a grown up rowdy 11 year old. At this creek, there is this cliff that is so high, like on the way down, I took two or three breaths before I took the one I had held on to. I’m talking so high you have to wear shoes and keep your arms tucked. But this kid, he dared me to jump. So what else could I do? I climbed up this cliff, and what a climb. It was way higher than two stories, and then three more stories was the top and a rope swing. Then like three more stories was the top. I get up there and do what you’re not supposed to do: I looked down. The kid chimed in, “Jump, you pussy.” And then his mom: “Come on, Frog.” Then with a running leap, I’m airborne. The kid is cheering, mom too. I can’t help but to smile.
