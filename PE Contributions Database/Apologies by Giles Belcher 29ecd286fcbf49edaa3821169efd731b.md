**“Apologies” By Giles Belcher**

This is very hard to do. In prison it is slated over and even pushed to the extreme. If not done in private you must do it in public.

In private, you could be made to clean up a person’s room, perform a sex act, and/or be beaten up badly. You could be made to give up or pay canteen if you have money to apologize to a person.

I, myself it has been a few fights which had to be done in order to prove I wasn’t in the wrong. When one started to lose badly, another would step in and fight. As a result, I ended up with sonic bruises, a bloody nose, and a black eye. The others are a lot worse off for them I will say.

Publicly, you have to apologize to the person you offend with a small speech or show of remorse. Otherwise, you must do so in front of the whole dorm. Then it is much harder to swallow your pride and lower your ego to do so. If not done as expected or soon enough, you can be given a strike, and possibly locked down.

I apologized once for setting out loud announcing what was to be taking laundry up, because of not being told laundry was being taken up. Someone decided at the last minute to take up laundry, and not communicate so. I didn’t have paperwork prepared for this. There are changes at any time. It’s hard to prepare for times when this happens. To apologize when such happens here is very hard to do.
