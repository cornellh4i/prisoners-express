**“Daddy’s Little Girl” by Michael Morales**

My wife Gloria called me and told me, “Babe we need to talk.” At first, I was kind of nervous because I thought she found out about my drug addiction. I was at work. So I said okay. And then she said “Come straight home.” I was like “okay.” So I come home, and I’m like “What’s up?” and she was like “I’m pregnant.” And I was like “For real stop playing, are you serious.” I had a big smile on my face. I was happy. And she was like “Yes I’m pregnant - I don’t know how that happened.” She was on birth control, something called I.U.D. I guess it’s a plastic deal inside of her. Anyway, we went to the OBGYN - “Coochie Doctor” - and sure enough, she was pregnant.

Of course I wanted my baby. I don’t believe in abortion, and I’m glad she never mentioned it either, anyhow.

The baby started growing, and almost every day Gloria would grab my hand and put it on her stomach, and I could feel the baby moving. We found out the baby was a little girl. Gloria said I could name her. So I named her Alexus. Because I always said, “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to buy a Lexus car so I’ll make one, and call it Alexus!!” Then her middle name is Josephine after my grandma! We called her Alexus before she was even born. The day Gloria went into labor, I was at work, and she called me and said, “Babe your mom is coming to pick me up, I’m having the baby.”

At this time I had an ‘86 Buick Skylark that only went forty miles an hour. That day I pushed it to the limit and went forty-five miles an hour. I was on the freeway and cars were honking their horns and passing me up. I didn’t care, I just knew I had to make it to the hospital to see my baby’s first breath. I finally made it, and it was for real. Gloria was in so much pain, screaming, cursing, crying, etc., etc. She even told me to beat the damn doctor up. They were telling her to push, and she was like “What the $@?* do you think I’m doing.” I guess she got so tired, she gave up on pushing, and the doctor said we are going to have to move into another room for an emergency C-section.

I didn’t know what to do, I felt helpless. The doctor took off his gloves and apron and asked, “Sir you can come with us?” So I left the room, and when I went out, my family and her family were out there. And they were like, “Did she have the baby?” and I was like, “No, they are taking her to emergency C-section, and I can’t go.” We were on the eighth floor so I jumped into the elevator, went all the way down, walked outside, smoked a whole cigarette and came back inside. I went back up to go check to see what’s up, and right when I walked in, all I saw and heard was, “Oh here she comes!” Alexus just slid out. I never seen nothing like that in my life. It was the grossest, nastiest, craziest, beautiful thing in the world. I didn’t cut the cord because I was in shock. I walked over to Gloria and told her “It’s over babe. I love you” and kissed her. She said, “Go check on the baby.” So I did!

They checked her and cleaned her up then wrapped her up and handed her to me. I just looked down at her and smiled. I felt like crying in my mind. I was like, I made this, this is mine. We were connected; this was daddy’s little girl. I walked over to Gloria and said, “Here babe you want to hold her.” And she said “No you wanted a baby, now you got it: she’s yours.” Gloria is a good mother; she was just messing around. I handed her the baby, and she just held her like nothing new, that was her third child. I took the baby back and just held her until they took her away. Anyway, from that day on, we stuck together like these two girls connected at their hair. I’m serious. I lost my job, stayed home then took care of her while Gloria worked. From the day she was born, all the way until I got locked up, Alexus was right there with me. She was my road dog, my sidekick. I taught her everything: how to crawl, walk, talk, all that.

I just saw her April seventeenth and I’m in AD.SEG so it was through the glass window. And she said, “Daddy do you know what I want?” And I said, “What you want beautiful?” and she said, “I want to give you a hug and a kiss.” I started crying, then she started crying too. She’s only seven years old, and I’m thirty-four. I’ve only got one year left, God willing, until I get out. I can’t wait to hold my baby girl again so we can be connected all over!

Thank you for reading this true story and remember all praise and glory goes to our Lord and God Jesus Christ! Amen!
