**A Warrior’s Thought by DeQuion Barker**

****As I sit in complete silence

Trying to imagine what awaits me on the other side

The Soldier’s bravery kicks in

Telling me to go ahead and fight

But the warrior’s intellect won’t let me leave

Without preparing for the night

So I sit back down and evaluate

The targets I intend to strike

And as I go over the targets

One thing keeps coming to mind

How one generational curse

Enabled four generations to become blind

Now if the youth is the future

How do we stop the future from dying

I know it will take discipline

Bravery, intelligence, and time

And out of the blue it hits me

Time is of the essence and there’s none to waste

Then the Soldier’s bravery

Gives me the extra courage it takes

So with the Warrior’s intellect

I make sure my boots are laced

As I prepare to walk out the door…

Knowing it’s war twenty-four hours a day...
