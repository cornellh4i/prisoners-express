**Almost By Bobby Ball**

Almost, very nearly but not exactly

magnets of massacre magnifies the mentality

the roadway packed with broken stones

navigates the soul to maelstrom

Face covered, eyes revealed

Symptoms of silence starts the symphony

telegenic tunes tickles the temperature

temporary tightness tames the trigger finger

almost, very nearly but not exactly
