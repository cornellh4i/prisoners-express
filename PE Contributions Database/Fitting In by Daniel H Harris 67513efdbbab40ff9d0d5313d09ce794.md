Fitting In? Not!

Many times we give up our unique natures in an attempt to be accepted. To succumb to external pressures is to surrender. Diversity of thought, and belief, is worthy of cultivation. In a culture that has developed labeled boxes which each of us is supposed to fit into, we become suspect if we refuse to fit in.

It has been my greatest pleasure to observe my fellow man trying to find a box for me. They first try on the labels. Just recently I was called both an atheist and an anti-Christian. I was another attempt to get a handle on me. God I believe in. Though not the way most do. For me, God is an infinite, divine spirit that flows through the universe. If the cosmos is a body then God is its soul. For those who don't believe in God you should know that God believes in you. That's what makes having friends who are atheists so wonderful. Best of all it makes people wonder. Don't you think its good for Nosey Nellies to use their brains? I do. When they use them on me I love it. They try so hard to figure out where I belong. If they get close I feel it is my duty to change direction just for spite.

Admittedly, the anti-Christian part hurt my feelings a tiny bit. Not enough to notice. Though I do my best to never be anti anything, Christianity is a tempting target. My problem is being surrounded by the Rabid Christian Moral Minority. One said I had no conscience. His opinion means little on this subject because he cheered as bombs fell on Baghdad. Now that is a compassionate fellow. As for me, I wept.

If you hadn't noticed, I'm a prisoner. You would think that would protect me from having to deal with many of the Christian persuasion. Unfortunately you would be wrong. It's hard to rest with all the thumping of Bibles. I'm rather outnumbered. Some thump more softy than others, but they all thump. Mike is my good friend (go figure), he tries to resist the impulse; the urge overwhelms his good intentions and he thumps at times.

Worst of all, though not unexpected, the number of Conservative Republicans is going up. Mike is one of those too. It's absolutely impossible to get the concept of individual freedom through to them on certain subjects. Mike and I have found ways to compromise on most issues. Wish our government would find it so easy. It only took a willingness to see each other's point of view.

My personal view of abortion is that I would never have one. Being a guy I don't have to worry about it. If guys got pregnant abortions would be an inalienable right.

They get pretty upset over the homosexual marriage thing too. Can't see where it's any of their business if they are not homosexual.

If you ever yearn to butt your head against a brick wall, try to explain the difference between the theory of evolution (based in science) and creationism (religious myth) to conservative Christians. They refuse to admit any possibility of evolution and expect us all to accept creationism as fact. Boy, will they be surprised to get to heaven -- if they get to heaven -- and find God invented evolution.

This leads us back to where we started. As you see I don't fit in. There are Christians all around me, not all as willing to allow me to think for myself as Mike, and I am forced to have dealings with them on a regular basis. Do I feel alienated? Often. That is the price I pay to retain my individuality. Well worth it at any price.

It is better to be alone with yourself, proud of who you are, than to be accepted by those who espouse beliefs you would be ashamed of. My silver lining is that it allows me constant opportunity to hone my ability to defend my views.

As I've told many, I am willing to defend anyone's right to believe as they choose. Contrary to popular opinion, America was not built to accommodate any single belief system but to protect the rights of all Americans to believe, or not, as they choose. My choices are different from most, some might call them eccentric, though precious to me.

In a world where diversity is under constant attack we need more people willing to beat their own drum and set their own rhythm. In the ability to embrace each other's differences is the strength to change the world.
