**“Backtrack” by Alton Chavis**

Sapphira stirred quietly, on a surface that was both rigid and rough against her petite bare frame. Whatever it was, it was moving along steadily, and Sapphira initially hoped that she was floating along some aimless stream into oblivion. She extended her fingers down, to feel. There was no water – only something smooth like metal, and intermittently coarse like wood. Straight away, the aromatic mix of morning dew and forest leaves invaded her nostrils, and ably negotiated her eyes to open.

Groggily, Sapphira’s pupils adjusted to daylight, and a sea of the fluffiest, most marvelously arranged clouds she had even seen before. They were lined by gatherings of lush treetops, sprawling toward her on both sides. Sapphira sat up, resting her palms on the gritty sepia hue of an ancient rail cart she now realized she was a passenger of. She looked both forward and backward, and was greeted by a mirror image of limitless forest and railway tracks -- no bends, no curves, simply straight. A number of obscure speculations, both dim and daring, instigated her imagination on and impelled her to be prepared for the unusual.

Then suddenly, Sapphira saw her appear in the woods, on both sides at the same time – running with reckless abandon. She had braided russet pigtails with long blueberry tassels wafting away from them like flags; with a broad careless grin, smudged overalls, and those arresting tropical ocean eyes… Sapphira’s eyes. It was her – from a time both innocent and passed. Sapphira smiled at the memories, and watched her younger self pass behind a tree; emerging on the other side a few years older.

The pigtails were gone – the overalls now a turquoise tinted leotard with matching ballet slippers. The tassels had transfigured into a lengthy cobalt ribbon on a wand, which the youngster fluttered around her – rhythmically twirling and leaping below the forest canopy. Sapphira remembered the routine, and, for a peaceful moment, felt her passion for the performing arts flicker within her. Sapphira’s eyes continued to follow her adolescent likeness as she spring-boarded high up into a spirited flip, spinning the ribbon about her into a cerulean cocoon. As she landed, the ribbon constricted then fell to pieces, and an ashen echo of the adult Sapphira stood out amongst the forest breadth.

Sapphira’s eerie doppelganger was imprisoned impassively within the boundaries of a porcelain tub. Her indigo-tinged hair, Sapphira’s hair, was elongated and elegantly arrayed across her nakedness. She looked to Sapphira, sobbing and outstretching her colorless arms to reveal seeping scarlet lines. A burgundy murk then spilled over the tub, and across the forest floor, and splayed out onto the tracks in a gushing flow. The rail cart continued onward amid the goopy flood.

Sapphira tried to preoccupy herself – tracing the cherry slashes in the beige of her own arms, brooding then regretting. Why had she done it?

Without warning, a subtle vibration made Sapphira’s head swivel behind her. She was no longer alone, but as to what was now in her company… she had no feasible clue. Structurally, it was a lanky and skeletal being. Its integument was translucent and reflective like glass, and its innards were moving swaths of a sparkling force unknown to rational human perception. It raised its hefty hands and, as the cart propelled forward, the crimson tide began ebbing away.

Before Sapphira could consider leaping down onto the reemerging tracks, and feeling, a consortium of murmurings formed in her mind and composed into a warm human tone.

“*Hello Sapphira*” it resounded.

Sapphira nervously *signed* her response, “H-Hello? Where Am I?”

The soothing vocal amalgamation continued, “*Unfortunately, beloved, we cannot sufficiently answer your query without revealing the unmitigated design of the entire universe. More importantly, it is not this setting which should concern you. The imperative question is… where do you wish to go?*”

Sapphira measured her thoughts, exhaled remorse, and gesticulated her communication sincerely, “I was just tired really. Tired of it all… the world… wanting to hear… to belong… searching. All I ever *truly* wanted -- needed… was acceptance… love-- peace. Take me *there*. At that moment, a rift of dazzling intensity materialized just ahead of them.

The being pointed forward, “*Then, that is where we shall proceed. Be not vexed by your transgression. We know what dwells within your innermost moral fibers. You are now absolved and unbound. Be both cheerful and comforted beloved… for the beautiful embrace of your eternity awaits*.”

Sapphira reclined in serenity, free, bowing her lips into a genuinely joyous smile.
