**“Weddings” by Sam Jenkins**

I am a hopeless romantic. I have always been that way. I dreamed of a nice wedding where me and my true love would celebrate a relationship that would surely be remembered for at least a century. We would make our vows before God, family, and friends. Maybe Bob Marley is playing in the background: “I want to love you and treat you right every day and everynight.”

Wait. Does that make me a bad guy? Weak or something? Guys are not expected to imagine their weddings. It is okay. The wedding, or the marriage, was hardly a dream.

To understand the wedding, you have to understand the relationship. I will attempt a brief and painless synopsis of the three years prior to the wedding. I met a girl. She was a lot like me. We had struggled with many of the same things and held mostly similar values. She had a son with whom I got along famously. (When she told him I wasn’t his Daddy he argued, “are you sure?” He was three at the time.) In my heart he was my son, still is. It seemed like a match made in heaven.

It started slow but grew into something solid. Then we began to fight, verbally. The relationship afterwards can be adequately described as: argue, argue heatedly, break up, make up, get back together, repeat.

I should mention that neither one of us were models of ideal mental health. That was part of our common struggles of the past and present though she was mostly in denial. She was in constant fear of having her son taken away from her. This was a vague, possible, consequence to every action, though it mostly resided in the person of her parents.

We could not have a public wedding because her parents would stop it and take her son away from her, or so she thought. We found an old friend of mine to perform the wedding a couple of hours away, closer to my hometown.

The week of the wedding I did not have the money to buy the rings, cheap rings at that. I had never imagined this predicament; this was not the stuff of dreams. Saturday morning, I still had not told her. We were to be married that evening. I thought of calling it off; it was the logical thing to do. Part of me knew it was all wrong while other voices whispered that his was my only chance at love, happiness, and the American Dream. When she found out, she was mad. She yelled a lot. She actually said, “I started to call the whole thing off, but you are not getting out of it that easy.”

Here is how it went; she called a friend of hers who owned a boutique who gave us a cheap pair of bands. The minister had a small church available in Georgia. He called back to find out which state we bought the license in. Since we bought it in Tennessee, it had to be performed there. The preacher said it was important to have friends there that would hold us accountable later. We had a couple on my side and a couple for her side. I had to call “my couple,” who were sitting in a restaurant watching football because of the ring delay, and redirect them. Finally, we were married in a public park. Her friend took pictures. My friend’s wife said, “Sammy, I hope the honeymoon is better planned than the wedding.” It wasn’t. We went home and watched borrowed DVDs.

The marriage wasn’t any better than the wedding. I am not sure why the relationship took the turn it did. I have my suppositions, but in the end, I think making it official raised the stakes. We had an even harder time getting along. She turned violent and I eventually responded in violence. The divorce was the longest part of the marriage.

I am not trying to blame her or run her down. I am being as honest as I know how to. The fact is that we stood under the blue sky and bright sun with our closest friends at our side, respectively, and made oaths to our God. They sounded good at the time; better or worse, sickness or health. We were both sick. We walked in eyes wide open and without a clue what these things would look like; sickness, health, better, worse. I have heard it said “it is better not to promise God anything than to promise and not fulfill it.” I agree.
