What an entrenched animal laughter is, especially in the excitement of the spectator! Is there something so delicious as another’s disasters? But there are also people with the gift of speech who’ve learned to control and convert the spectator with comic wit. This power to delight and flatter has stopped many riots because the instigator has been guided into gales of laughter that overcomes all opposition. If a funny story won't work, self depreciation usually will.

Comedy is a singular power, leveling all other distinctions. There is no defence, no learning, no rational that will stand against it. It’s like stepping into quicksand--the more one fights against it, the more entrenched one becomes. The vision of the comedians is what keeps him sane and protects him from the influences of drab pessimism and blatant hostility.

Living so closely with each other in prison, it’s easy to be caught up in the distorted perspectives that rule life here. The halls are filled with vitriol being expressed through profanity and violence against each other, in place of the people that are to blame for the loss of freedoms. Including themselves! Nevertheless, there are some who have learned to cope with this crazy life, surviving with humor and wit alone. Laughter rivals the vitriol in prisons if one listens a little closer. It might be suppressed but it’s always present.

The comic doesn’t have the capacity for hostility toward other inmates or the harassing guards. They face any ridicule or violence with humor, with laughter. In the hopeless world of hatred and violence, the comedian will stand in the face of death and tell jokes about herself, the environment, the ridiculous situation, even the “killer,” and survive for no other apparent reason than she created laughter.

A friend of mine (I’ll call him Melvin) is a death defier. The sort of comedian who can’t let a good opportunity for a joke to pass. He started out in prison a little timidly, not thinking he could use his talents for protection. Not in a prison! But he couldn’t contain his inner jester. He finally found his balance and used his skills--a mixture of verbal sparring, physical clumsiness and a face that can express any emotion he desires no matter his real feelings.

I have done a lot of time and am still amazed at the magic-like ability Melvin has to resolve a situation with the power of laughter. How he makes the most serious things seem funny. One time, I saw Melvin in one of his many elements. We were in the day room area of our section where he was playing cards while I watched TV. A dispute began over some perceived slight on Melvin’s behalf toward one of the more hardened convicts (I’ll call him JJ). I didn’t see how it started, but when I looked over, I saw Melvin on the floor with JJ looming over him. The section became silent. I felt despair creep over me like a smothering blanket. “Whatya gotta say bout that?” J.J. shouts down at Melvin. “You little f___! Get up and let’s handle it!” Melvin sits there a moment longer, scoots back away from J.J., and slowly stands up. Fixing himself, he steps back another couple steps, watching J.J. from under his slightly bowed head. He looks up and smiles one of his best smiles and softly says to J.J., “If we came here for any other reason than our crimes, it certainly wasn’t to enjoy ourselves with violence and grovelling. But I’m pretty good at grovelling when the situation calls for it.”

Silence. J.J. stands there unsure how to handle this unknown reaction. I notice his lips quiver slightly, like two worms having sex. Someone in the crowd snickers, which sets everyone to laugh. J.J.’s body relaxes and a smile appears on his face--ending the illicit sex--and he steps forward, slapping Melvin on the shoulder and says, “I’ll take care of the violence then, you little f__.” Melvin grabs his arm in mock pain. Grimacing dramatically with his expressive face, “That’s a relief. I’m terrible at violence!” Very funny! I feared he was a dead man, but it was him that did the killing.

Time’s easier to bear for those living around Melvin. Laughter eases the anxiety that is implicit with life inside. Our overall situations aren’t comical, but to be able to laugh at everyday things, and at oneself, with others, life becomes a little easier.
