“Life; And Purpose?” by CL Nobles

For me it’s The Interval Between Birth and Death, And It’s Aim And Goal. It is to exist And Have a Place. It is The State or Fact of Being Present And Its Relativity. The Intermediate between Past And Future, And Its Impression. Our Current State And Its Validity. The Quality of Being And Its Effectiveness. My essential nature And Its Remembrance. The Basic character or Qualities of humanity and our production. Humanhood And our Welfare. Civilization And Its Potential to attain excellence. Society And Its Achievements. A People having mutual Interests, Shared Institutions And a common culture. Being conscious And having a determined course. A sense of one’s personal or collective Identity, And the manifestation of one’s desires. To strive and Be motivated. To Acknowledge And worship Allah. To Give Praise And Be Grateful. And last But not least, to Live! And to Die.
