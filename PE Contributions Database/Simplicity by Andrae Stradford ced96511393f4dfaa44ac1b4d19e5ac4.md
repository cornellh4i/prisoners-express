**"Simplicity" by Andrae Stradford**

When I want to wind down, I go to my island to collect my thoughts. This tree I planted 3 years ago provides my lab with chloroform and UV rays. What is deceptive about my lab is its simplicity. Underground is where I conduct psychological studies and sometimes I play call of duty in my spare time. When I get enough energy from the hydroponics from the 3 cells out back, I like to collapse the roof (AKA false front) and gaze at the Ursa Major.

Simplicity keeps my lab from being found. It doesnâ€™t look like much from the outside, but inside, under the stairs, is a whole bank of computers, beakers, and internet. I have been eluding the government for years because of, you guessed it, simplicity.

Now I must leave you and go to my day job. Thank you for visiting Simple Island.
