**Retirement Success by Anonymous**

The deep cherokee rumbled down the road. I inched closer to my new home away from home. After all these tears I could finally retire. And though I wouldn't be one some reality show I know I’m still a mountain man. A fortune in resources, green gold and even gold itself lay ahead. I could easily lose my character as I had in disbelief watched my youth slip away in a maximum security prison. Soon. Soon no more empty gold sniffer bottles. The exercise to keep me fit and focused. The rear view has a glance at equipment. Yes, and very soon a fire and unfilled arms filled once again. No more hollow pains bouncing in my heart like a 22LR round in a skull.

I felt nostalgia, thinking of romantic notions and the romance of financial independence, even wealth. I felt shock. Like I was learning a whole life, surreal. To walk away from family, well, some graves anyway. They’re dead and buried. Acquaintances and friends, those non dreamers who stayed behind. I take a drag. Lights on now I push play on my new phone. Bluetooth sinks up and memorable songs are a soundtrack to a near beginning now. A closed corner of my past. My arms will be filled as my wallet only faster. I can be anyone, more now than ever.
