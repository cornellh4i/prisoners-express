***Ha Ha so Funny, Ha Ha so Funny* by Red Dot**

Putting tacks on the teacher’s chair,

Putting fish water in her.

Tease watch her temple flair

wish, turns to lit aster stimily tease,

he-he so funny he he so funny

painting people’s toenails there the gate

put music shave in his ezte

that a real close shave dying laughing

hehe so funny he he so funny

put raw fish in your pants

or shit in your suitcase smelling like the restaurants

head spin from the big shit

haha so funny haha so funny

these games are just laughter

pranks are good jokes

maybe not funny after

are you swear then hehe

hehe so funny he he so funny
