**“Zion Tact Team” by Alfred McGlory, Jr.**

****Zion has become a bit unstable since some of the original members went on to the afterlife three months ago. Ms. Lydia has assigned twenty-four young but capable men to conduct order among the six races of inhabitants of New Zion. It’s been mass beatings and social uproar. Since the Tact Team has been active things have been calmer, aside from the new wave kids, who have been making attempts to steal subs and emerge to the surface, which in not handle correctly put us all in great danger. We are down to twenty-three subs left with no way of building more, most of our food supply is gone, people are worried. Ms. Lydia assures us that our environmental team is working on new filter system to extract salt from the water to make it safe to drink and run hydroponics system to grow new food. But that’s the least of New Zion’s worry, level six is considered the main level which is the only level you can see through into the water. We been having sightings of some cars and creature swimming by and trying to break the glass which is super thick, ten yards of thickness to be exact, we don’t know the nature of the creature but it is not of this world or maybe it is, it makes a sound that can be heard inside the compound that gives everyone goosebumps. Ms. Lydia plans on the Tact Team going out on a sub to fight the thing. This is the crew untrained and scared shitless. The sub is fixed with laser cannons, nets, and powerful LED lights. At nine PM we will attend a dinner in the Great Aquarium Hall and hope for the best when the Tact Team sets out on their mission.
