**“Death in the South” by Catherine Lafleur**

As a child, I had a passing acquaintance with death in Meriveaux, South Carolina, my mother’s hometown. Several octogenarian relatives rambled about the family, living well into their second century. Great-Aunt Portia just got older and older. Her body refused to give up. She buried five husbands and would wear her last husband, Able’s, clothes. She claimed her collection of elegant black funeral dresses for the five husbands were her burial trousseau. Portia was a little dotty. On bad days she would pull one of Abel's shirts up over her head and run through her backwoods with the sleeves flapping around her in imitation of a white tailed deer. For ninety-two, the old girl could run pretty fast. She was ready to go but couldn’t bring herself to do anything about it. Her plan was to run around imitating wild-life until someone shot her.

Meriveaux is a town so tiny that the main intersection has only a yield sign. It’s the site of the town’s biggest motor vehicle accident between a hearse and a tractor. The tractor was driven by my third cousin Beauregard Hartnell who had a decades long feud going with the deceased, apparently unresolved by his death. The hearse contained the remains of cousin Simpson Dupree, a man who never forgave a debt of any kind. Alcohol was involved. As to who was at fault, it’s entirely debatable depending on which side of the family you are most aligned What is a known fact is that upon impact, Simp’s casket was defenestrated out the back swing window of the hearse to hang inelegantly like a partially disgorged Twinkie across the hood of the lead Cadillac. Fortunately, Simp remained ensconced in his Maple casket. The aftermath raged for months, until the town council finally voted for the yield sign to be put up.

After the sign was installed, this became the place where family members too young to attend internments would gather with ice cream cones from the Diary Air Shop at the intersection. Kids would wave flags, pinwheels, or just their hand as the procession passed by and shout goodbye, goodbye! The age of acceptance for funeral attendance was between eight and nine. Helen’s was the first open-casket wake I attended. I was nine. Great-aunt Nora’s house overflowed with lilies, wreaths, and sprays of white roses. My mother’s first cousin, Helen, died young, aged thirty-five. Her husband, Fortner, mistook her for a deer as she fried up the morning pancakes in the kitchen one Sunday morning. Shot straight through the heart.

Nora freaked out about her daughter’s makeup. It was all wrong. The foundation was too pale. She barked at Miss Mindy, the funeral home representative, whom she had backed against the refreshment table. The table creaked as Miss Mindy’s considerable hindquarters threatened to disrupt the placement of the sandwich trays. Mother and Aunt Jeanette tried to soothe Nora. Aunt Jeanette had her Mary Kay sample case in the car - everything would be fixed up right.

Mother could have been Helen’s twin. Nora had a hard time looking at her. Mother just smiled and shooed me to the parlor. I wandered back and knelt on the prié dieu at the casket. Gazing at Helen’s face, I understood what upset Nora. Helen looked pale and … well … yellow. Not her normal tan and rose complexion. What would Helen think of all the drama over makeup? In life she only wore plain lip balm.

Corpses in open caskets are beyond grotesque. Relatives and friends were saying “Doesn’t she look natural? Couldn’t she just sit up and talk to you?” I looked at Helen’s hands loosely clasped at her waist and reached inside. Her hand was cold and rubbery. Brother Revel’s voice floated in from the front yard where an impromptu prayer meeting under the spreading oak was commencing. He boomed out how the dead would rise in the flesh and Helen could leap out of the casket.

At that moment, I couldn’t move my hand. Cold air blowing from the window unit seemed eerily freezing. I prayed hard. “Please don’t sit up, Helen, please don’t get out of the casket.”

Mother entered behind me with a tube of Rose Blush lipstick in hand. She assessed the situation and reached over to clasp my hand in her sweaty hot living flesh. Mother pulled my hand out of the coffin and told me to scoot to the backyard.

At the funeral, I dutifull appeared at church for the funeral but wouldn’t get into a car for the ride to the cemetery. Instead, I wedged myself firmly into the station wagon with the rest of the babies for a trip to the Dairy Air. The hearse passed, I waved my treat and souted “goodbye, goodbye” as loudly as I could.
