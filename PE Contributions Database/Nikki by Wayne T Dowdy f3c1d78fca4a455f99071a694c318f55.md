***Nikki* by Wayne T. Dowdy**

Nikki was my friend who was the color of midnight without the stars. The only part of his coat not black was the tip of his right front paw.

OUR HOUSE: The three-bedroom brick house that I grew up in had a cement basement, apple and peach trees in the backyard, and a dogwood and a mimosa tree in the front. A busy street ran in front of the house that was the main thoroughfare between several towns and cities south of Metro Atlanta.

FRIENDS & SCHOOLS: The house sat across the street from two schools and small businesses. Fast forwarding seven years, I became a hoodlum by the old age of 12.

ARRESTED: My first juvenile arrest came from burglarizing and vandalizing the schools with Stanley, my older brother and his friends. I broke a window to get inside. Prowling around the cafeteria and kitchen area, in search of something to steal, I found a gallon jar of sliced dill pickles. The others were playing basketball on a court beside the East Wing of the elementary school. I opened an upstairs classroom window and threw pickle slices at them.

“Hey, how did you get in there?” Stanley asked.

“I climbed through a window.”

“Let us in,” one of the others said.

VANDALS: That’s when the vandalism began. I let them in. Stanley’s friends threw cans and jars of food that damaged the kitchen and cafeteria, then went to the high school gym and stole weights and sports equipment. One boy’s father asked his son, “Where did you get those weights?”

INFORMANTS: That was when the first state witness against me was born. According to the turncoat, confederate, he first lied, then got beat with a belt and confessed to his and our crimes. He told everyone involved. Off to juvenile we went, including the informant. The other kids blamed Stanley and me to make it easy on themselves: our parents had to pay more restitution because they did.

I didn’t have much trust in people before then since my brothers told Mother on me all the time. The arrest helped destroy the trust I had left. That arrest began a long line of crimes and arrests that ultimately lead to my writing straight from the pen about my favorite childhood dog.

JETS & PLANES: Some woods and the world’s busiest airport--Atlanta International Airport, as it was called in the early ‘60s--were behind the school. Before I was old enough to venture off into the woods or to cross the street to go to school, I stayed in our backyard playing with Tonka Toys, plastic dinosaurs, army men, Hot Wheels, and a variety of other toys, as I sniffed spent fuel from jets and planes flying over the neighborhood.

A DOG’S LIFE: More than anything, I loved spending time with Nikki, a Belgium shepherd and wolf mix that my dad brought home to me. Nikki listened to me when no one else would; he didn’t want to fight with me like my brothers, and he didn’t scream at or beat me like my mother did. He didn’t expect anything from me other than to be fed and petted. I never failed to live up to his expectations. We grew up together.

FRIENDS: I had friends, but Nikki was the best one. When my mom beat me, as she did on a regular basis, I ran outside to pout with my arms around Nikki. He understood my pain an dlicked my face to show he cared. If I fought with my brothers, which caused many beatings by Mother, I’d go outside and hug my true friend who accepted me as I was. We’d even hang out together in the basement to catch birds.

BIRDS IN A BOX: I made a trap from a stick, a long string, and a large cardboard box. I’d lure the birds into the box by sprinkling breadcrumbs near the inside edge and center of the trap. I had to keep Nikki behind me, inside the basement, to stop him from taking off to scare my prey.

DARN CATS: I laid on the steps leading down into the basement to hide from the view of the birds. When the birds entered the danger zone, I’d yank the string. Sometimes I won, sometimes, the birds. One time after I won, one of our cats stole the bird from me and ate it. Darn cats!NIKKI TOLD ON ME: My parents worked, my mother as a seamstress in a shirt factory and my father as a service station attendant. My mother’s mother lived with us, so that left my grandmother to care for me and my siblings while our parents were at work. She was the only grandparent I ever knew: all the others died before I was born in 1957.

Anytime she came to the back door and stood on the porch yelling my name to come eat, or for whatever other reason, she said Nikki would tell her where I was hiding. If I was up in an apple tree, he’d stand under it and wag his tail. If I went over the fence to vandalize the neighborhood, he’d run and stand at my point of departure. The problem came when he learned to climb the fence, too.

I was in third grade when Stanley rushed into the house, “Nikki got hit.” He was chasing Mr. Wheeler’s truck. He ran over him and kept going.”

I ran out of the house to where my best friend lay in the street, parts of him mangled from the tires that took his life. I was devastated for days. It screwed me up so bad that I laid out of school.

I dug a hole in the ground to place Nikki’s body. I wept at the loss of a non-judgemental friend whose spirit returned to the darkness where it roamed with its ancestors.
