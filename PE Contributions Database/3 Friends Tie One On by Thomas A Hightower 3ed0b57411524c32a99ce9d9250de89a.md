**3 Friends Tie One On by Thomas A. Hightower**

As a teen of the 70’s, my friends and I tied one on every weekend. It was just part of the times we grew up in.

There were several of us who grew up together in “old Broderick” (a suburb of West Sacramento). We were all part of the working poor, a couple of the fellas were from the middle class section of W. Sacramento. I called them privileged. That is because most of us grew up in the dirt poor section of town. My home was built in sections added onto a 1930’s 1-room cabin, made 100% of used lumber and recycled nails (pulled out of boards and pounded straight again).

For us, a weekend binge drinking was our only escape from our poverty. We were poor, yet we were rich because we had each other. No one judged in my group of friends. It was the peak years of the 1960’s love generation. The 60’s were only the beginning. It was the 70’s that really rocked the world with sex, drugs and Rock & Roll.

We were also blessed with color blindness; and full acceptance of freaks, geeks, and LGBT. It was your bond as friendship that counted.

We watched the race riots of the times side by side with people of color, never understanding why people of color were so marginalized. So we walked shoulder to shoulder with African Americans, a march for equality.

We heard Martin Luther King speak, Caesar Chavez spoke many times locally. All of us worked the tomato machines each harvest season. To me, I was blessed to be raised blind to prejudice by my paternal grandmother. She came off the Oklahoma reservations during the “Great Migration West” of the Dust Bowl 30’s. We are light skinned American Indians: ½ of my family is super dark, reddish brown, the rest were tanned white skinned.

The 70’s matured the 60’s into a permanent part of history. 70’s was the glue that put back together a new America from the broken pieces of the 60’s riots.

I could write a book on this subject. But the short story is, we cared deeply for our friends. I think more so than the world is today. We are too quick today, in changing friends, on growing indifferent in this “me first” mentality of the 2000-2020.

Treat your friends like family. Treat your family like the gold they are. Grow closer to each other before life imbritens you.

God bless the 60’s and 70’s. They are what brought America out of the indifference to the blight of others. God bless our nation, but don’t forget your friends of your childhood.
