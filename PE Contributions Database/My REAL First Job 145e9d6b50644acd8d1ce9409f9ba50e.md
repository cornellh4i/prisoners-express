***My REAL First Job* by Teddy Bartling**

All of us have a “first job” experience where we get our feet wet in the working world. For many of us, we couldn’t wait to get a job after school or during summer vacation so we could have our own money. I got a job with an oil field company at the ripe old age of 14, making a whopping $2.45 an hour. I did everything from tend exotic animals, build fences, and drain ponds. I even worked on actual pumping wells. Exotic animals at an oilfield company, you ask? During the oil boom of the early ‘80s, men made so much money so fast that they didn’t know what to do with it, and there were worse investments than exotic animals. Anyway, I completely missed the real point of having a real job: money should have been secondary to the real value and lessons I should have learned in having a real job.

Truthfully, our first jobs had nothing to do with gainful employment or making a buck. Our first jobs began the day we inhaled our first chestful of air and wailed our indignance of being pulled from our warm, comfortable world into the cold, cruel one we now inhabit. Our “first jobs” were to learn learn learn and grow grow grow.

At first, all our learning and growing was pretty much a “gimme.” Crying meant “gimme” a bottle. Sticking out my lower lip meant “gimme” a hug or a rattle. Physically growing was pretty much automatic too, as long as someone supplied the bottle. I learned the simple stuff: walk and talk, don’t play with food or stick stuff into the electrical outlets, and don’t poop my pants. By not sticking things in electrical outlets, diapers stay much cleaner.

After a few years, I got promoted to the next level: grade school. Growing now meant getting bigger and stronger mentally and emotionally. My cold, cruel world mentioned earlier took on another bad aspect: second graders. For some time, I thought they would eat us first graders, and though I was bitten once or twice in some frays with them, I wasn’t eaten. And I learned how to run.

I also learned about fighting and prejudice, especially prejudice against who you are, what you stand for, and where you are in life. I learned not everyone liked policemen in the early ‘70s, which was confusing for this 6 year old because my dad was a policeman, and I was sure he hadn't done anything to the 6 year olds I was around. When those other kids talked bad about my dad or picked on me because of him, I ended up fighting. Fighting was against the rules, and so I got in trouble with the teachers, which got me in trouble with my dad. I just couldn’t win! I wanted to please both the teachers and my dad, but I didn’t want to get beat up (2nd graders are viscous).

Many times, I cried on my way home with lumps and scratches from fights with bigger, and even gangs of, boys. My dad would tell me there's nothing he could do--what? Aren’t people like him (fathers, cops) supposed to protect people like me from people like that? I was beginning to see why some people didn’t like policemen. What a hard lesson for a first grader, huh? My job was hard enough with ABC’s and 1,2,3’s, and stuff like adults can lie and even say, “Do as I say, not as I do.” Being a kid was the hardest job of all, but I pulled it off by putting myself on autopilot and acting instead of reacting.

Remember when I mentioned I completely missed the real point of the value and lessons of my first job? That’s what happened with my first *real* job: life. I unplugged and coasted through high school, the military, and even a war in some extreme combat on auto-pilot. I never accomplished anything that really mattered or made an impact on the world around me. Auto-pilot is no way to go through life. Like cruise control, you still have to steer and watch where you’re going or you’re going to crash. I crashed in a big way that I’ll probably never recover from.

What should I have been getting from my job? Stamina and staying power. A good name and mutual respect from my peers. That physical and inner strength from persevering when I really wanted to quit. Integrity, a new viewpoint, and good outlook from listening to that grumpy, mean boss who certainly knew more than I did about what I was doing and about where I was going.

It’s funny how growing is a learning process, and learning is a growing process. I’ve grown and learned that my “First Job” is to live and do right. To do it with as much integrity as possible. It’s never too late for you to learn this. Good luck with your “first job”!
