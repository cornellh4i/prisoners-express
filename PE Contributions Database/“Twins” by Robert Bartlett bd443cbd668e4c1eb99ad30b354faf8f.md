**“Twins” by Robert Bartlett**

I’m a hair man. White men like big chests. Black men like big derrieres. Though I’m a sucker for small women with a big but not too toothy smile, the first thing I look at is a woman’s coiffure.

Cathy lived at the other end of my block, not far from the donut shop. She stopped in there for coffee every day, Monday through Saturday, at about 7:57 AM. She left about 8:10, give or take a minute. Sometimes she’d be licking honey or sugar off her fingers. (She was so *hot*!) Once, she left at 8:14, sputtering angrily about the bad service. It occurred to me that she might not return, and then I’d have to learn a whole new routine.

“The next time you see her,” I told myself, “You must talk to her!” “What shall I say?” I asked myself. “What can I talk to her about?” Nobody answered.

“What,” you may ask, “is so difficult about asking a woman out?” I don’t know. The more desirable she is, the scarier. This one was drop-dead gorgeous.

She had a beautiful face, a sexy body, and long, shiny hair. She had big blue eyes, a cute little nose, full, sensuous (not fat) lips, and graceful curves. She had slender but shapely legs. Her arms were fit and trim but not overly muscular. She had a perfect, clear complexion and long, shiny hair.

It took about three weeks and a dozen or more feeble attempts. Please don’t ask for details: it was a very humbling experience. Happily, though, it ended in a Friday night date. I made some reservations, ordered some tickets online, and bought new clothes.

I had plenty of time. I couldn’t pick her up until seven o’clock; she made that very clear. After she ate a light supper, she and a friend would be doing their hair.

We had a wonderful time that evening. The next Friday was almost as good, and I saw her a couple of times a week after that. Then we were seeing each other almost every day. I was on cloud nine, although I still hadn’t made it past first base.

Then I received this out-of-town job offer. It included a higher salary, more benefits, moving expenses and a signing bonus.

I was so anxious to tell Cathy that I carelessly arrived at her house a half hour early. That was a major no-no. She had impressed upon me early on how she valued punctuality. Being late could often be forgiven, but being early was an inexcusable imposition. As I walked up the path to her front steps, it occurred to me further that she might not want to move. What if she said “No”? Or worse, what if I told her I would have to move and she asked, “So what?”

“We’re up here,” She called down to me. She sounded only mildly irritated. Briefly, I imagined being in bed with her and her friend, both trailing their soft, long hair all over my body.

Such thoughts were not quickly dispelled. Her friend was as beautiful as she was. She had a beautiful face, a sexy body, and long, shiny hair. They could have been twins.

I was sweating badly. I realized that I had dated both women. Suddenly a lot of things made sense. I had noted and wondered only briefly about certain eccentricities that no longer seemed unimportant: she never ate meat on certain days, never ate dessert on certain days; one day she wanted to watch musical comedies, another day she wouldn’t watch anything that didn’t have blood and guts in it.

I stood frozen in her bedroom doorway. Tumbled thoughts swirled in my brain. The swelling in my crotch was at this point more from embarrassment and confusion than lust. I had important matters to discuss with the woman I loved.

“Come on in,” one of them said. “We’ve got a surprise for you.”

On my way home that evening, I saw the sun set behind the hills beyond the wheat fields for the last time. The stars seemed brighter there than they do in the city, and appear earlier. I could just make out the constellation Gemini as I approached my house. I wiped my eyes and pushed the gas pedal to the floor.
