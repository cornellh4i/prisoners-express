**“Mountain Poem” by Miranda Reeder**

Chills-

The feeling that flows through my body, along with the coldness that encases me deep down into my bones. All of this stemming from the snow that my feet, my body, is resting on.

Chills-

The water in the stream is racing beside me, causing me to remember that the world is always moving. Somewhere, somehow and with life that is moving along with it. All of it beyond comprehension for my mind alone.

Chills-

The reaction of my body to just one gust of wind within the trees and all around me. It causes my hair to flow across my face and subsequently my mind wonders just how far that gust of wind reached and how many people, places and things were able to feel its power.

Chills-

The sight of the mountain lingering in the distance seeming so far away yet able to keep us focused only on its beauty. All of its elegance, dimension and exquisiteness are unable to hide the amount of underlying curiosity that forms as you ponder what lies in the mere distance between you and it.

Chills.

The subtle yet forcefully blunt realization that while my mind, eyes, ears, nose, fingers, toes and mouth are all so centered on taking in this moment alone, the rest of the universe marks this as a minute and unwavering pin in a map.
