**“Parental Responsibility” by Nate A. Lindell**

Describing life with my parents wouldn’t shock many prisoners, as they too often had generally1 calloused, abusive, incompetent parents, despite many prisoners not realizing such (what each of us experience seems “normal” to us, including abuse). Some of my experiences include my parents neglecting me to the point that i was hospitalized with pneumonia four times before I was the age of two, mom kicked me down basement stairs while I was breathing through my tricycle handlebars (gouging a hole in my palate, etc.), my stepdad (he was struck in the head by lightning, thought that was God anointing him, which, at the time, wasn’t as funny as it now sounds) starving us kids for days while our mom was tied to their bed and having demons exorcised, etc. Morbid readers can read more about my toxic rearing in my essay published in Parental Incarceration, “Routledge” (2016), where dozens of other prisoners describe their own twisted childhoods.

I’ve conversed with many prisoners about their own lives, and it amazed me how many came from insanely abusive homes. For example, about the most dislikeable guy I ever met (he brought a girl out in the woods, a friend, raped her, cut her throat, stabbed her, scratched some leaves on her and left her to die), a tall, scrawny, emotionless guy, emotionlessly told me of his childhood, told me how his parents killed whatever spark of humanity he had: his parents were more guilty of the crime than he was. A close examination of Ed Gein, Wisconsin's Buffalo Bill, will lead you to the same conclusion.

While correlation doesn’t necessarily prove causation (e.g. Ted Bundy had a tame childhood…), as a prison psychologist once said to a group I was part of, “It seems like you guys were groomed to be prisoners,” after hearing about our lives. In some cases, correlation is because of causation.2

It’s amazing how the criminal justice system never takes responsibility for the “monsters' ' created by its often negligent cousins, child and family services, and education departments. Instead, the PIC opts to punish us more, sentence us to years of oppression vs. habilitation (you can’t rehabilitate those who’ve never been habilitated in the first place, like the forenoted rapist/murdered), despite prior years of abuse and neglect so obviously failing to result in prosocial development.

While many prisoner’s parents are at fault for their offsprings’ criminogenesis, less parents are to blame (blame connotes moral guilt, that parents intended to create monsters). Our parents learned from their parents how to be crappy parents. The first people we learn from and model ourselves after are our parents. From our parents, we learn what people are and how they act; we learn what we are likely to grow up to be; we learn how men should relate with their mates; and we learn how to raise children. Many people, due to their innate personality (inherited from parents) and values (much learned from parents), desperately cling to what they learned from their parents, even if what they’ve learned is proven wrong or evil! (Look at the hate in the world -- thanks mommy and daddy!)

Even if not entirely decisive, parenting is central to our development. This morally obliged parents to guide our development, to nurture us so that we can live healthy, safe, fulfilled lives in the world that they brought us into. Yet there is a noxious view, inspired by the commandment to “honor thy father and they mother,” that children are little more than slaves to who parents should, “spare not the rod.” That noxious view is cherished by many child abusers, by many prisoncrats, and by many predatory politicians who’ve climbed to power on the broken bonds of prisoners.

Ignorance of how people work and clinging to flawed traditions is causing people much senseless misery.

This is merely an abstract…., not relevant to all prisoners.

Notes:

1. Even in the most abusive homes, parents are, sometimes, kind, loving, which doesn’t compensate for abuse. See, e.g. A Mother’s Touch, Trafford (2006), p. 165: this is an excellent book when it comes to explaining how abuse can warp children’s development.
2. See the August 2017 post, “Society Makes Its Criminals,” on [http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540](http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540) for a fuller explanation of how child abuse/neglect creates criminals. Also see A Mother’s Touch, supra, pp. 28, 150, 154-155.
