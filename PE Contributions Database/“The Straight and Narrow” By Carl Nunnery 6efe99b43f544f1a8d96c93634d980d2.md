**“The Straight and Narrow” By Carl Nunnery**

This railroad track seems to be going straight ahead, but yet as it disappears into the fog, we really do not know where it may be going or where it may lead you. This could portray a lot of people’s direction in life as they appear to be going straight but their destiny is cloudy and uncertain.

Does the road you are traveling seem to be going nowhere or to be going in circles? You don’t have to be one of those macho men who think that they never have to ask directions or that it is not cool to do so!

My friends, God is our source of information and he says, “if any lacks wisdom, ask God who giveth to all men” (James 1:5), then by doing this “God shall direct thy paths” (Proverbs 3:6) and “wisdom is profitable to direct” (Eccl 10:10), this is an easy recipe for success!

The truth is, no one can get to heaven on their own, but good news: the cost of the trip has been paid by our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross (1 Corinthians 6:20) and our ways have been directed (Psalms 119:5). All we have to do is follow the Lord’s directions and we will reach our desired destiny!

Remember, “the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life, and there are few who find it” (Matthew 7:14).
