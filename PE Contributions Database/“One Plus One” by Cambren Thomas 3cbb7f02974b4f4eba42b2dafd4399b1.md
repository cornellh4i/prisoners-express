**“One Plus One” by Cambren Thomas**

Adowa and Arturo walked the ocean shore in a giddy silence. Art watched the waves diminish along the shoreline, as he traversed the coarse granules of the beach. He broke his gaze from the gentle push of the tide, and peeked over at the frame of his striking future. Even in the dimming glare of the cloudless sky, he noticed that Adowa’s sundress was sheer in some very specific areas. As he admired her curvaceous allure, a sweet yet salacious smile peeked through his upbeat countenance.

Adowa caught Arturo’s smile, unbeknownst to the mild sensuality of his subconscious, and it affected her soothingly. It had a nuance so familiar, that it transported Addie to the mood and memory of their first date. She recalled how they had an instant attraction and connection, how their first kiss had been absolutely enchanting, how they had been inseparable since then, and how today would make three years of fairly unblemished bliss between them. A small stirring, and a yawning coo, brought Addie back to the present. She looked down at the beautiful baby girl that she was holding in the nook of her arm. She was napping comfortably, barefoot and pacified, in a knitted newborn dress.

Arturo continued to sneak peeks at his ladylove, while she observed their tiny curly-haired beauty, and he soon faded into his own reminiscence. He went back to the day that he and Adowa had found out that they were having a baby. It had been about a week after their first mini-misunderstanding had attempted to rattle the foundations of their ever-budding love. Still, their collective joy at the prospect of welcoming their first child into the world had purged the residue of their brief word war, and they had continued to flourish. Arturo abruptly swerved back into his current reality, after he felt a slight swell of perspiration attempting to douse the fibers of his collared top. He wiped across his forehead with his index finger, and readjusted the gear he was carrying to one side.

Adowa and Arturo concluded their brief trek across the seashore, and entered a slightly secluded coastal precipice. Art went about arranging a few simple decorations. Addie rested on a smooth boulder, and hummed a soothing lullaby to their infant while she watched her beloved. Arturo continued to set up a portable lectern, Bluetooth speakers, his laptop, a GoPro, and his drone. By the time everything was in place, the dusky skies were reaching a pivotal pinkish-orange glow.

Arturo reached in his bag, grabbed the rings, gave one of two plastic packages of assorted flora to Adowa, and prepped his drone with the other. Addie single-handedly adorned her locks with a headdress of assorted blooms, and touched up her minimal makeup. Art finished reading his tech, and took his place at the end of his faux aisle. He pulled out his smartphone, remotely began video-recording and live-streaming to their extended family and the minister, and started some light music. Both Art and Addie expelled a breath of elated satisfaction as their homespun nuptials commenced.

Adowa ambled towards Arturo in rhythmic pauses, tot-in-tow, while the automated-drone wafted flower petals before her. As she reached Art, their digital preacher began his jovial oration. Soon came time for the betrothed to vocalize their heartfelt vows, and for the exchange of their rings and joyful tears. Finally, it was time for Arturo and Adowa to indulge in their first kiss as husband and wife - but, their little one had alternative plans. She unexpectedly awoke in Adowa’s arms, wailing and thrashing in a sleepy stupor of exasperation and hunger. As their ceremony was brought to an abrupt closing, so that they could pamper their precious princess, Art and Addie couldn’t help but smile and giggle at one another.

As the sun finally dipped below the plum-tinged horizon, blessings and goodbyes had been expressed together with their digitized loved ones, and everything had been repacked away. Adowa and Arturo embraced each other in the soft seaside undergrowth, beneath the awakening stars. Their infant laid betwixt them on a blanket, coddled and guzzling down her bottle contentedly. Adowa rested her ring hand on Arturo’s, and looked up at him. Arturo dove into the center of Addie’s soft caramel irises, and she lost herself in his smoky grays. They kissed with a mellifluous and soul-binding passion, and for the first time that whole momentous evening - they were ONE.
