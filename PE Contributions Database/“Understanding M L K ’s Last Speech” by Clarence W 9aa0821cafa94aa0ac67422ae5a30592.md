**“Understanding M.L.K.’s Last Speech” by Clarence Whitaker-Jones**

****Martin Luther King, Jr. said he’s been to the mountain top in his last speech before his assassination. I understood this message, seeing beauty in what people may or may not seem to realize. There is beauty in every living matter God created. God created the mountains to be still and to move by His will, though this may be a scary sight as you’d witness the rumbling and cracking erupt and depart from the ground. This phenomenon is moving. This creates a greater slope to climb, and so when you reach the top, it was worth the climb. Slipping rocks, insects that bite, and singing birds are around so you may enjoy your adventure while being pushed and pulled by the wind. The climb may get tough, you may curse and fuss and even feel ready to give up, but at the end of the road, you can’t wait to fill the thrill with one mile to go.

M.L.K., Jr. didn’t literally climb a mountain. He climbed through obstacles in life, the same way his experience made him get to the peak of his message. The echoing words can still be felt and heard from generation to generation. “I have climbed the mountain top,” he states at the top of his voice after all his travels and stops. He has seen enough to say there is beauty in you, and I thought we may not think so. People that are older than us have the wisdom to speak things from a view we cannot see. We may have to go pass that tree and bush to see. There is something to see, and that’s why you have eyes to see. The beauty is at the mountain top of your life. It’s just as beautiful like the mountain climber who climbs it twice.
