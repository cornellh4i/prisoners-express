**“Solitude and Reflection” by McKinley Clark**

Sitting alone and reflecting upon my life, in the expanse of God’s creation, brings to mind how fleeting this life truly is. When you really consider it, I believe a cancer patient had it right. When asked how they cope with having been told that they have a terminal illness, they responded, “Life is terminal, no one gets out alive.”

The only real hope we have is to live a life of contentment and peace. What does it matter if we strive and live a life of exhaustion to accumulate a world of material things? A life without contentment is futile. Do you think that stuff will make you content with your life? I once thought so.

The thing about stuff is that you spend so much time and resources trying to accumulate it that you forget what is truly important. Self importance, above normal self-preservation, is simple pride and arrogance. Have you ever seen an animal so full of pride or self importance that it refused to tolerate another of its own species because of something it said or did? Only mankind does that. Mankind is the only one that pities itself as well.

Look back over your own life, if you’ve the guts. I say guts because they’re a requirement to be honest with yourself. Do you have the courage? There are good and tragic times in everyone’s life but those can be slanted with our emotions. Look at your own choices and take an honest look, without prejudice, to see if you’ve been true to your own convictions.

We all have opinions about how we would respond to circumstances. It’s not until we’re deep into them that our true nature and convictions come to light. What are your convictions? What are the standards and principles that you feel so strongly about that you would refuse to comprise?

I had some for a lot of years that I thought were rock solid. Life is ironic at times. What I thought were convictions were simply ideas that “felt good” to talk about, but that I just couldn’t uphold. I wilted in the face of something temporary and unfulfilling. I found out years later that a true conviction costs you something. It costs you the illusion of pleasure without consequence.

There is something that you gain to replace that. It’s called true conviction without compromise. That brings self respect, true respect from others… even those who may not agree with you - they can respect your lack of compromise.

Oh, you’ll probably lose some folks along the way as well. You’ll find that once you develop some convictions that those without them will drift out of your life or you’ll drift out of theirs. Those who have real convictions will eventually display them and those without won’t feel comfortable when they’re around at that time.

I recommend that everyone examine themselves and develop some real convictions. The younger you are, the better because they’ll come in handy to guide you through the rest of your life.
