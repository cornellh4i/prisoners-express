**Young Men on Couch by James Stevahn**

Larry and Moe were sitting around in their living room. Moe was flipping through the channels, nothing of interest. He looked over at Larry who was sleeping. His head was back on the couch serving up, mouth open. Moe grabbed a handful of popcorn from the bowl on the coffee table. He threw pieces trying to make it in Larry’s mouth. The first one hit his nose which caused Larry to twitch then rub his nose. Moe smiled and tossed another one, which went right in. Larry choked and woke up. He looked around and spit out the pieces of popcorn. Moe was at the other end of the couch eating popcorn while watching the TV. He was deciding what to do, but his thoughts were interrupted by a voice.

“Hey guys,” Curly came into the room covered in dust and carrying a box. He plopped down between the two on the couch. Larry and Moe fell onto Curly. The three knocked their heads together and dust flew up off Curly. “Look what I found.” Larry and Moe looked questionably at the box. Curly didn’t reply Moe took two fingers and poked Curly in the eyes.

“Ow! What was that for?”

“Come on dummy, tell us what’s in the box,” Moe said. Curly barked at Moe twice, then pulled out some old VCR tapes and photos.

“I found this box marked “college.” There’s some tapes in here from when we went to college. Let’s check them out?” Larry grabbed one of the tapes and put it into the VCR. It showed the tree in bell bottoms and tie dyed t-shirts.

“That was the day we left the orphanage for college.” Larry wiped a tear from his cheek. Three hours later, the three red-eyed, sniffling stooges finished the last video tour down memory lane. Curly reached in the box and pulled out some photos. He held one up.

“Hey, look at this photo. Remember the event?”

“That was our graduation party,” Moe said.

“No, this was our first college party,” Larry said, “Look, Curly was skinny and had hair.” Curly barked at Larry. Moe grabbed his beer.

“Heel boy,” he said. What else was in the box? They spent the rest of the day arguing over each picture and when it was taken.
