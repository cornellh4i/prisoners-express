**“Nicknames” by Chad Frank**

When I was a baby, I was bald and had a big head. My mom thought I looked like Charlie Brown, so she called me Chuck.

Some things never change: I’m still bald and have a big head, and people think I look like Charlie Brown. The nickname Chuck has a ring of Americana to it that reminds me of rockabilly singers and astronauts, and also my favorite author is Chuck Palahniuk.

As a teenager, I adopted p=[chad] as my nickname, one that has gained me notoriety and infamy. The Feds have made much of the “P,” speculating that it means “Philly” or “Pedophile” among other preposterous possibilities. Truth is, the “p” doesn’t *mean* anything. Like most things in my life, the p=[chad] nickname was the result of serendipity. All of my friends in highschool had nicknames. I wanted one, but none ever stuck. Prince, my childhood idol, recently changed his name to a symbol, so I thought it’d be cool to follow his example. But what symbol would *I* use?

The answer literally fell out of the sky one day when my friends and I were walking past a dollar store and a strong gust of wind blew the “R” off the sign. When the “R” hit the ground, the leg broke off, causing it to look more like a “P.” My friend Dan looped a dog chain through the eye and gave it to me to wear like a necklace.

When I wore it to school the next day, black dudes called me Master P and hot chicks who previously wouldn’t give me the time of day stopped me in the hallway to take pictures. I became a celebrity overnight.

So I combined the P with an algebraic equation, which has always seemed mysterious like unsolvable riddles to me, to form my new nickname.

I used that nickname to create a controversial and provocative figure, both in my public life and online as part of an international child porn ring.

Nowadays, I have an aversion to nicknames. During my prison term, I’ve noticed that people who go by nicknames usually have something to hide. I’m not at a point in my life where all of my secrets have been exposed. I may not like the name I was given at birth or the baggage that it’s gathered throughout the years, but it’s mine… for better or worse.
