**Gotta Run… by Anonymous**

Gotta run to the store for milk and bread. Gotta run to the bakery for mom’s birthday cake. Gotta run to pick up the kids from schools. Gotta run Hazel to ballet and Hermin to soccer.

Why do we always have to run to get things done? When, if ever, will we slow down to just walk somewhere? What ever happened to that “love to stroll on the beach” mentality common to personal ads when seeking a mate? At the rate we are going, we are going to “gotta run…” ourselves to an early grave.
