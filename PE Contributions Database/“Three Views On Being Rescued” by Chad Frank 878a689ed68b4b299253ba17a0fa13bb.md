**“Three Views On Being Rescued” by Chad Frank**

There are three ways of looking at the Rescued theme: 1) as a blessing, 2) as a curse, 3) as Impossible.

My mom is the kind of person who finds her blessings in rescuing abused animals. She’s been abused and misunderstood in her own life so that she identifies with pitbulls which are probably the most abused and misunderstood dog breed. Over the years, my mom rescued several pits from fighting rings and even adopted three as her own pets. Most people saw those dogs as vicious animals that deserved to be put down, but to my mom, they were as cuddly and lovable as baby bunnies. Those dogs were grateful to have been rescued; they repaid my mom with unconditional love and loyalty. Since I’ve been in prison, my mom has become a prison advocate, lobbying for changes in visitation policies, for the abolishment of mandatory minimums, and for prison reform. She has also supported several prisoners whose own families abandoned them. I may be biased, but I think this makes my mom a saint. I’ve always admired priests, teachers, and volunteers who give their services to others without asking or expecting anything in return.

People who view being rescued as a curse are those who are filled with bitterness and regret, or generally hate life. I’ve known several women who hated their babies’ daddies so much that they hated their kids in turn and regretted not getting abortions when they had the chance. As a result, many of their kids wished they were never rescued from abortions. I also know a few suicide and overdose survivors who are bitter that they’re still alive. Victims of crime may also fall into this category.

People who view being rescued as impossible have usually been screw ups so long that they’ve given up hope of being rescued. My stepdad is such a person. Despite being rescued from himself several times, he continues to drink, do drugs, and be the abusive asshole he’s always been, which makes it seem like he doesn’t want to do better.

I’ve held all of these viewpoints.

Before coming to prison, I was the kind of person who found blessings in helping others. Unlike the priests, teachers, and volunteers I admire, I had my own selfish agenda. If I’m honest, I didn’t want to rescue anybody, not even myself.

When I first came to prison, I saw being rescued as a curse: though prison probably saved my life, it also caused me to suffer. Some days, I still wish I were dead. My victims may feel the same way.

I’ve been a screw up so long, I often think that being rescued is impossible. As a sex offender, I’m not seen as the most sympathetic character, so not many people are willing to give me a second chance--not that I had much of a chance to start with. I also struggle with self-hatred and bitterness, which makes most days feel like an endless war.

No matter how bleak things seem at times, I refuse to give up hope. Increasingly, I find salvation in my writing. The more I write, the more I understand about myself. By publishing my work, I gain acceptance and understanding from others.

Maybe I’ll be rescued after all.
