**“Blink of an Eye” by Stephen Lee Birchfield, Jr.**

It is such a cliché “Blink of an Eye.” As an eternal being measures of time mean very little to me. On the other hand if :Blink of an Eye: is being used as a signal to commence an event :Blink of an Eye” holds great significance for me.

I have stood upon the scaffold waiting for eternity to arrive in the blink of an eye. Standing there mindfully striving to maintain Continence, actually caring what the spectators may think. Ha, it is a chore to keep those knees from knocking together. Your personal judge’s gavels. Going to meet your death with alacrity is a desired and honorable endeavor, a stiff upper lip and all that hoo haw. Let me over it is wise to never be brought out first being forced to wait for the others to be brought out. Not all go quietly, resignedly.

There were six of us scheduled to be executed for various reasons. I murdered a man because he tried to be a hero. ALl the dipshit had to do was let me walk out the door, but oh no.. He must’ve been watching male fantasy movies, Steven Seagal or something. He soon learned that even tough guys can be perforated by lead cruising faster than sound. So on the scaffold I stood.

Most of us in the criminal world have delusions of our own abilities to evade and resist, “court in the streets” and all of that. When there is a barrage of bullets whizzing around your head self preservation has a tendency to take over. Standing on that scaffold disgustd a the other cowardly miscreants begging and pleading, shitting and pissing, refusing their fate to no avail, I realized I wish that there was enough courage within me to let the cops kill me on the streets. At least it would have been on my terms. “On my own terms’. Hmm, that does mean a lot.

Finally, everyone is ready and beginning with me the Warden reads out my crimes. Asking “Do you have any last words?” In fact I do. I prepared a speech, and was going to wax eloquent. In the end all I could say was: “Don’t be a hero.” Pretty lame for last words. The next guy- a rapist/murderer- did a lot better than me. The Warden had to cut him short. And so on and so forth.

“The Scaffold is high and eternity near- - - -” Let’s get on with it. All of us are staring at the Warden, waiting for his signal. The sadistic bastard blinks one eye, and a specially appointed guard pulls a lever. Our necks snapped and that it, all she wrote. During our terror who knows what is going through our minds. I think that perhaps we believe that as long as we stare down the Warden he will not be able to blink his eye. Eventually, we must all blink, Does the Warden wait for all of us to blink at the same time before he winks? Eventually, I’ve a moment of elevator, stomach sensation in my belly, and I feel myself ejaculate. Amazing what the filthy body did all in about a second and a half. Blink of an eye and my life on terra firma is over.
