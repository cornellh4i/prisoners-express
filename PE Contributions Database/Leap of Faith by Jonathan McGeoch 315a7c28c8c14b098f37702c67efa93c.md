****My leap of faith was a moment of boldness, a moment when I took a risk… a risk to trust… to trust myself… when it seemed as though that risk wasn’t deserved.

And so I plunged into the deep and murky waters. I invested the whole of myself into that moment, and for over a decade, that decision drove me yet affected more than just me. In the end, it turns out that my better judgment was correct: I was not to be trusted. I shouldn't have placed my own faith in my own self on that fateful August day a decade earlier. My own walls came crashing down upon myself, but in the process, the bricks came tumbling down upon those close to me. I was hurt, but others’ wounds cut much deeper and their pain felt more than my own. I deserve my own pain. The others deserve not the pain I have inflicted upon them.

Despite my history (known and unknown), my soulmate put trust in me and took a chance, a risky, daring and stupid chance, some may say. My soulmate became my lover, and my lover helped me become a better man. My soulmate had no reason to believe that I would change, that this time would be any different than before, but like how they say that love is blind, faith is blind. We need to jump in. Love never occurs outside of risk. Love never fails if we are unwilling to take a chance. But love cannot succeed unless we first allow it to blossom.

I would not take any of it back, for each of my leaps of faith--the success and the failure--have all led me to who I am today, a struggling yet growing student of this realm. I seek diligently to learn each day about God, love, forgiveness, and suffering. And as today transforms into tomorrow, I will step off the ledge and take that leap of faith, ever hopeful.
