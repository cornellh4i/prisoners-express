**"Reading" by Robert Chandler McRee**

My ear thrummed like a pizza-joint jukebox on Saturday night. I sat in Mom’s lap, the safest place in the world for a little boy with a chronic ear condition. Dr. Fain’s green, vinyl-cushioned chairs squeaked as patients adjusted their legs and arms, staring and not staring at the other people in the room, and hoping against hope that their name would be the next one the nurse announced. The boxy television console blared the latest game show to the hushed, antiseptic-smelling waiting room.

In front of me, Mom balanced the latest issue of *Highlights* magazine and opened to the adventures of Goofus and Gallant. Her whisper calmed the throbbing in my ear, her steady cadence in the way she described Gallant’s good deeds never wavering, even as she moved on to Goofus’ patented and often weirded goof-ups. Then she flipped to the Hidden Object puzzle, a favorite of both my brother and me.

“Can you find me the baseball?” she would repeat until my eyes lit on the concealed object. Sometimes I just wanted to hear her say the object over and over; her voice was so soothing. “Good, you found the baseball.”

She would shift her elbows slightly. “Now -- can you find the flower pot? Where is the flower pot?”

When the *Highlights* issue had been exhausted, Mom retrieved the Bible story hardback which all doctors’ offices seemed to have in ready supply and on prominent display. Illustrations were quite graphic, detailing Adam and Eve’s flight from Eden in shame, to the monstrous and sinister Tower of Babel, to Moses commanding through God that the Golden Calf be destroyed. As mom read, I kept thinking that the Old Testament was no place for a kid until we came to the chapter on David bringing down Goliath. In my mind, I fantasized owning a slingshot that might be powerful enough to take off a giant’s head in one throw. David became an early hero of mine.

As we continued to wait for the nurse to call my name, I fingered Mom’s charm bracelet. By this point, she would have encouraged me to get down from her lap and climb up into the next chair, leaning against her or against a heating pad that she hoped would dry up the already-boiling fluid coursing across my eardrum. On her bracelet were, among other objects: a molar that someone from Dad’s dental society had given her; a four-leaf clover; two teensy baby booties, one for Jeff and one for me. Even in my own young hands, these charms were fascinating miniatures, kind of like sterling silver versions of the clay toys we could pick out of the treasure chest following our six-month visit to the dentist, where Jeff always threw up.

Examining these trinkets dangling from my mother’s wrist, my burning and aching ear was lulled by each object’s comforting clink as I rotated her bracelet over and over. Then I traced the vitiligo patches up and down her arm, white splotches that made me fear she might be disappearing. The tinkling chatter on her bracelet, I imagined, would be the only way I might ever have of locating her in the world if she were to vanish completely. In that waiting room, I clung to that bracelet and her restful voice, reading and reassuring.
