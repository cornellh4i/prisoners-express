**"Family Reunion" by Brian Lowe**

I have only been to one family reunion in my entire life. I was around ten years old or close enough to there that it doesn’t matter. It was my father’s side of the family, and I didn’t know most of them. For one, I didn’t realize that there were that many of us in existence. My dad is the second youngest of eleven boys and girls. I ad elderly aunts and uncles there with children and grandchildren my dad’s age and great-grandchildren and more down the line that was my age. Many of them I had seen around town and even went to school with and had never known that we were of any relation. It took me several years to realize that most of my own family didn’t like us because of how my mom and dad were and how they raised my sister and I. Mainly my sister because she is a true monster, but I was a difficult child as well. I met a lot of people there and talked to a few afterward, but mostly never associated with them again.

I was a difficult child, and my mother’s family didn’t like my sister and me either. I have never been to a family reunion on that side of the family or even been extended an invitation to attend one. So I have never really had any family besides my own and a few relatives here and there. Everyone else is against me actively or strongly indifferent towards me. So growing up and living life, in general, was really hard for me. The few relatives who did associate with me usually were criminals or outsiders themselves that wanted to just use me for their own gain and schemes.

So you could say that family reunion is a dirty phrase to me. Having tons of family but the vast majority wish I did not even exist pretty much sours me on the whole concept. I care about it and often wonder how much better and different life could have been. But you cannot change the past so why bother, it’s never going to change.

I am exhausted on this subject.
