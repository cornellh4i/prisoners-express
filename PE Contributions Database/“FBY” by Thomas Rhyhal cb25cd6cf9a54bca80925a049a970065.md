**“FBY” by Thomas Rhyhal**

She wears the veil in mourning

covered in blacks, the look of death, all you can see is the sound of silence hearing

now that you are alone life will never be the same.

The sacred connection has been severed, and now everything in comparison is lame.

You try to go on, but trying to forget, and resistance to feeling memories is futile.

You’re living a lie to yourself and the world, there is no existence, nothing is real, I have no smile.

I have no more to give, I’ve never been given anything, all is lost, forever has no end or beginning.

There is no time, there is no space, waiting for love is longer than eternity, when will I wake from seemingly dreaming.
