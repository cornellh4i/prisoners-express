**“Rewards and Frustrations” by Carl Branson**

Gaining a reputation as a “jailhouse lawyer” has its rewards and frustrations. It goes without saying that the frustrations far outweigh the rewards as a consequence of the “Don’t try to confuse me with the facts (or law) because my mind is already made up” attitude of the criminal injustice system. This attitude is exacerbated by the roughly 97% conviction rate as a result of plea bargains. Merely doubling the demand for jury trial from 3% to 6% would cause the criminal courts to implode.

I prefer to concentrate on those rare rewards. For example, a number of years ago a fellow felon asked me to identify grounds for relief for his appointed post conviction relief (“pcr”) attorney to pursue. After about a 30 minute review of his case file and about 5 minutes of library research time a glaring ex post facto violation was apparent. Turns out that the statute under which he was charged was not enacted until three years after the alleged conduct occurred. Although it took 3 months to grind through the system, the state made an offer in settlement of an anticipated civil suit before going to the evidentiary hearing which vacated his conviction and resulted in his release from prison.

Probably the most ego-inflating experience happened when a fellow felon forwarded a copy of my illegal sentence argument to his pcr attorney. The attorney, together with her paralegal (also AJD), arranged for three visits and spent over 9 hours with me to fully understand the statutory and constitutional relationships I relied upon. During our final meeting the attorney assured me of a job upon my release (I’m not holding my breath). And the paralegal forwarded relevant research materials (about 150 pages) that I had no way of obtaining from in prison. Also, this same attorney utilized, verbatim, over 4 pages of my argument on another topic in an appellate brief for a different client.

Sadly, the illegal sentence argument was “too hot to handle” and would have resulted in the attorney being black-balled by the legal community. Therefore, this illegal sentence theory is being pursued on the basis of *in propria persona* (casual for in the proper person) pleadings by fellow prisoners. Thankfully, recent U.S. supreme and appellate court decisions are making It easier to overcome the procedural default and statute of limitations barriers previously employed by both state and federal courts to deny relief. But, make no mistake, it is still an uphill battle.

Being a competent “jailhouse lawyer” is certainly “Tricky Business” when you don’t have access to a decent law library or internet resources like Lexis or similar search engines.
