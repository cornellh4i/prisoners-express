**Journey by Dakota Martin**

I had been waiting for that moment in my life, to go on an adventure and explore on my own. And when I did, I dived in. Thinking I was ready to learn first hand what people were like. Of course I knew what all kids know; don’t talk to strangers, tell someone where you’re going, etc… And I didn’t listen, I didn’t want to. Talked with random people online then ran away to go meet them. I didn’t care what happened, I didn’t want to be at home anyways. So yeah, that was just the beginning. I kept going deeper and deeper going all kinds of ways, taking sharp corners and crazy twisting curves. Even backtracked some when I hit deadends. I did it all without a light. BIG MISTAKE!! And now I’m at the end of the tunnel seeing the light after seven long years in the dark. So when you go on a journey listen to advice and remember to bring a light.
