**"The Worst Birthday" by Robert Richter**

I was born on December 24, 1968. The man had not yet walked on the moon. My whole childhood was a complete disaster, and the irony of my birthday made it worse. How do you feel the Christmas spirit when you live in a house of horrors? The only good thing was that I got two days in a row without being beaten, the only time of the year I could ever hope for that.

While you might think that a day without pain was a good thing, any relief at the lack of torture was far outweighed by the sense of creeping doom, the certainty that “punishment” would be doubled and redoubled in the following days. My gifts would be taken away, perhaps forever. One year when I received a much-wanted red plastic sled, one of the neighborhood bullies brought his own battered, broken old sled to my house and claimed that I had jumped on it. Can you guess what happened next?

A mother who had seen that broken sled a hundred times would have sent that kid packing, but not my monster. She made me trade my brand new sled for that old piece of junk. Even worse, I wasn’t allowed to throw it away. It remained in the garage for years, mocking me. For all I know, she still has it, smiling every time she sees it in memory of how she used other kids to hurt me. And yet, her plan backfired. Her evil was so obvious that the other kids actually started to feel sorry for me.

I hate holidays and always have. To me, they reek with hypocrisy. Why pretend to care on just a few special days a year? If I want to give someone a gift, I give it to them. I don't need to wait for a special day. Every holiday reminds me of how desperately an evil person can want to be seen as a good person, but I am not fooled.
