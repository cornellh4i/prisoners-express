**Fishing with Bob by Mark Adam Peirano**

It was the late 1990s, and I had accepted work with an organization/enterprise that would usher me into management/administration of uncivilized pursuits, aka organized criminal enterprises. I had left a career position with a local telecommunications company, as it offered too meager an existence compared to my ego and unrealistic expectations, mostly about living life on my own terms.

The “position” I had accepted was to bring the family business some needed help with accounting of both personal and the finances of the organization. The family business I was meant to help was headed by a man named Robert, but everyone just called him Bob. Bob was, at the time, an up-and-coming entrepreneur whose family business had grown too fast for its own good, and had begun to collapse on its own success. Mostly due to disloyalty and theft by those whom Bob had mistakenly believed were his loyal friends.

I started the job by auditing everything; financial records; property and inventory records; personal records of legitimate family businesses that were the foundations of the entire enterprise. I took over hiring and firing, and approving major transactions, and starting to find ways to track the dollars and cents that had never been tracked before in Bob’s family enterprises. There was resistance from below, as some were living well on the untracked profits – which no one, before, had even known were missing, because no one kept track. I upset this “system” for many of Bob’s “trusted” associates. This was, of course, dangerous for me, but due to my status, Bob knew that I would be unharmed for fear of greater troubles than any of Bob’s “trusted” associates could have ever wanted. Bob was under obligation to those more powerful than he to get his house in order, and I was part of the terms to Bob’s agreement with them to do so.

To Bob I was a mystery, for I was only in my mid-twenties at the time, yet people that Bob had no choice but respect and honor had insisted that I be hired on to get things in order, etc. Bob tried in every way to pierce through my professional veil and work on charming me to, perhaps, be more under his control than would be, ultimately, good for him. Bob didn;t want to be strictly business – he wanted to befriend me – and it bothered him that I never took off my tie and never talked to anyone except about business. Finally resigned to my impenetrable armor of business professionalism. Bob began retreating to simply drink and hang out with the department heads that I had not fired that hadn;t resigned after realizing that the easy pickings that no one noticed when Bob alone was running the business were gone, and that each department head would be expected to produce a profit – and report the earnings and only take their allotted “commission” – and no more.

Bob’s driver would arrive later and later, sometimes not at all, as the months went on, with a drunker and drunker Bob (a stoned and more stoned Bob) in the back of his obnoxious limo, shrugging at me as to Bob’s condition for the day. “What about Bob?” became a real question for everyone in the organization each day – as he would get drunk/stoned and then spend the day glued to one department head, demanding their attention on any trivial project had a whim about, no matter how fruitless. I realized that this was the only control left for Bob at this stage, so I encourage “department heads” to simply sacrifice their time as Bob insisted.
