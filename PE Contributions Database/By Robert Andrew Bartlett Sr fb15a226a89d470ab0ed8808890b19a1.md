**By Robert Andrew Bartlett Sr.**Â 

Young man sits alone

With one unanswered question:

How to talk to her

Young girl with a pail

Young man with blood running hot

Water spews from a hose.

Water everywhere

But the bucket is now dry

Still, she ignores him

Does the girl not know?

Is she really unaware?

He dares not to ask.

Wet girl at the well:

Why is it hard to be kind

To the ones we love?
