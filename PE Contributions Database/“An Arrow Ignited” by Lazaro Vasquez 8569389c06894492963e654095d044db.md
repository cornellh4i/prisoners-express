**“An Arrow Ignited” by Lazaro Vasquez**

It’s been almost sixteen years to the day. That’s how long he’s been battling in the war he still fights his way through. He left nearly a whole two years before even that.

I’ve moved on. Prior to his leaving I had told myself that I was one with him. I was fed up with his hard ways, his expectations, and his inconsiderations. At least that’s what I had told myself regardless of the fact that I didn’t really believe it. Then he left, and though I’ve pushed him away, imprisoned in the past I’ve left behind, I know he will return. Because he is stubborn. He is selfish. He is the type of man who can lie down and die when he decides he does not want to live any longer, until someone tells him that he is finished, that he can’t win. Only then will he choose to get back up.

I thought I could be happy without him, but I’m not. My life did not get better. In the past he has tried to contact me more than once, but I was too angry; too hurt to care. I tried to disappear off the grid when I left my city in hope of beginning a new life. Not even he should be able to find me, I thought to myself; however, in my heart I know he’s been tracking me from the very start, even before he left.

I often stare out this window into a world of vastness, a huge matrix of endless possibilities. I know he’s out there; that they have yet to destroy him. I know this because I can feel him. I have no idea exactly when he will resurface, but resurface he will. Somehow he’ll find a way. I will forever be unprepared for that hour, and still, I know that day is inevitable.

He will come for me. He will not relent. He has kept me in his thoughts, his prayers, and his most precious memories.

This city is so expansive. When I stare through this glass I find myself confronted with the honest truth that his treacherous, perilous trek, by all accounts, should be impossible to complete. The journey has taken him so long, taxing us both in excess of our breaking points. Yet, I know that over the horizon, beyond the distance of my visual perceptions, he perseveres.

The world will not hold him. It can not hold him. This realm simply is not immense enough. The time will come when I will look up and he will be here. I have imagined many times what I might say to him; what he might say to me.

I will tell him that he is my past, that he has lost me and any and all opportunity of resurrecting my love or affection. Then he will tell me that he still loves me, and that I am his everything. He will vow to me that the thoughts of me in his arms was the only source of courage and will he was able to salvage to grant him the strength he needed to survive all that they had set before him. He will profess that he has come for me; that he can make it all better. My hurt, my shame, my loss, my anger- my love.

I have heard them claim that time flies, but for us, it has crawled. I find my comfort in the assurance that he is one-track-minded. He will not veer from his course. He is an arrow loosed upon a battlefield and he flies true.

I on the other hand, from my window perched up high, feel as if I’m falling… falling towards the wings of the great phoenix, the firebird of lore. It is there where he will catch me up into the whirlwind of his flight and return me to the glory of my throne. This city and the world beyond think to thwart his efforts. However, I‘ve known for so long the one thing they never have. They are ill equipped to defy his rise. For they have never witnessed one fly from the shaft of a bow. No, time does not fly, but I know that he most certainly does, and I am his target. They would be wise to vacate his path.
