Well in school as a kid I was always called by lots of nicknames - but mostly by “Georgie Porgie pudding pie kiss the girls and made them cry,” Romano, Road Runner, He-Man, Lovers Boy, Chico, Day Dreamer, Puppet.

Romano and Lovers Boy because in school I liked and would with different girls - but really we were just friends but I had two girlfriends, one living two apartments down and the other a few houses down. Road Runner because I was in a soccer team and I was the fastest kid with the race. He-Man because one day I fought this guy who was taller than I behind the school building because he was bullying me a lot and my dad told me I needed to stand up for myself and when we fought we both had bloody noses and black eyes and after that he never picked on me again. Day Dreamer because I would always be imagining being like Bruce Lee or The Iron Fist. The Puppet, because I would let people use me.

Gato Negro because I would always dress up in black. Pachuco because I would have a bandana on my shoulder or on my head. Mr. Clean because I would always have my house really clean, wouldn’t let anyone smoke in my house.

And when I got in prison they started calling me Mr. Miaki from the first “Karate Kid.” My boss-officer I was working for gave me that name because I had shaved all my hair off because I was tired of getting told every time I needed to get a haircut. So I told myself, “The hell with it; I’m gonna get it all cut off!” So I’ve had it for about fourteen years, bald head. Another reason is because I’m losing my hair from the top...
