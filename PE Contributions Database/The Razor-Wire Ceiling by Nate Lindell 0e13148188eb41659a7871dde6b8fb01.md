**The Razor-Wire Ceiling**

Animals have always captured my curiosity, and in return, as a child I often captured them, brought them home and studied them.

I admired their appearance, how they worked. You ever look closely at the shiny black and neon-yellow striped skin of a painted turtle, at the gold/brown irises of a snapping turtle, the jade skin and alien limbs of a tree frog, the forest of blue-gray fibers that make a blue jay’s feathers, seen and felt the fine, soft brown fur of a baby muskrat, wondered at the ridiculous body type and pattern of warts and colors on a toad, chased the magical movements of a garter snake through sedge, studied a water snake’s glide across water...salamanders..mudpuppies (there was usually a river or creek where we lived)?

While a rugrat, when we lived in Montana, during a camping trip, my older brother and I stumbled across a baby wolverine that was in the process of being stung to death while raiding a beehive. I grabbed it by the tail, dragged it back to camp, with my brother’s help. We smiled, through bee-sting swollen faces, like drunks in love, as we held up our discovery for our mom and stepdad to admire. “Admire” it they did not do, but, in terror, took that cub far from our camp, packed up and we left before Mamma wolverine came inquiring as to WTF we were doing with her precious. (I still laugh about that;)

Animals seemed more reasonable than people did. They seemed more admirable too, at least until I discovered girls.

I wanted to be a vet or zoologist when I grew up. Instead, I became convicted of murder and was sentenced to life.

You may wonder, “Why?” It’s a question, however, that I do not recall anyone in the system asking as they guided me into the social role I now settled in, much like the brushers in the game of curling guide a sliding stone to its final resting place. Our parents, teachers, social workers, pastors, peers, even babysitters are the brushers in our lives, people whose influences determine the course of our lives, usually not consciously. (See, “Society Makes Its Criminal”, an August 2017 post on my blog - [http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540/](http://betweenthebars.org/blogs/540/) - for more on that.)

Had my father been Pat Craig (founder of Colorado’s Wild Animal Sanctuary) and my mother Jane Goodall, I’d have had a clear pathway to growing up and becoming a zoologist or vet. Had I even had a stable home I might have been able to make my own path to these professions. But, my home was violent and abusive in many ways, both my stepdad and mom (I don’t know who my dad is) were mentally ill and my mom was a poly addict. My mother cut off all ties with our stabler extended family, and I’d lived in more than six states and 15 houses before I was 15 years old, so I had weak community ties/support.

While I’m not bitter about it, I observe that my childhood...desire was thwarted by circumstances I had no say in.

While in prison I’ve studied and grasped very well poetry, literature, psychology, cosmology, neuroscience, neurophilosophy, litigation, etc. The head shrink here scored my full-scale I.Q. as 144 on the WAIS-III. I could have been an at least competent… anything, which WI’s prison system still thwarts me from becoming.

This is a democracy, sorta, so it seems that the people have decided that they prefer to groom and permit the grooming of children for the social role of prisoner, and, once in this role, to keep us in this role. My wish was thwarted, but somebodies are getting what they wanted.
