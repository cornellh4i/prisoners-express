**Cracked Pavement by Lorraine Bennet**

On the highway to nowhere, on a road I really don’t know where. You put me there in the midst of cracked pavement and peeling lane paint.

Whatever's behind me I can’t see anymore, it’s like driving a car without a rearview, or side mirrors, just pressing forward.

From this angle it looks like the picture was taken from the middle of the road.

Are you standing there?
