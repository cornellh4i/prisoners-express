**“Half” by Seth E.**

Lilly stared and stared, but just couldn’t seem to find the motivation to actually go out and be part of the bustling city today. She’d gotten ready just fine, had planned to meet Caroline for lunch, but then...well, then there was the…”thing” that happened on the elevator. After that, she just came back to the apartment and had been sitting in the window seat, watching life happen below, unable to push herself to go back out.

The “thing” had been somewhere between the 15th and 11th floor as she descended for the lobby. A guy with a visitor's pass got on and gave her a creepy look and a sleazy smile. This kind of crudeness had been happening ever since she’d “matured” at 11 years old, and only gotten worse over the past 21 years. As usual, Lilly ignored him, just focused on her phone, trying to stay away from him for the ride down.

But something caught her eye, a movement, and when she glanced over, she was stunned to realize this man was touching himself while he stared at her. When he saw her look, he grinned and asked “If you got your mouth open, you wanna put it to work, slut?” Lilly instantly screamed something, which seemed to make him irritated, but he stopped, called her a name.

Somehow, Lilly managed to have the presence of mind to note the floor they were on, and hit the button for a couple of floors down. This stopped the carriage at the eighth floor, and she exited in tears. She took the stairs back to her floor, 12 floors up.

As she ascended, Lilly thought of all the horrible things men had said and done over the years, wondering what it was that made men like that. She’d been leered at, touched, groped, pinched, yelled at, spit on, called hundreds of sick or demeaning things, followed, threatened, prepositioned, and generally abused just about every day of her life since the age of 11. THe list of crap she’ put up with, ignored, ran from, been assaulted with, and scared of, was so long she could never put a number on a total. And that didn’t even count the subtler sexism that she’d always experienced, mostly from men, but even from other women.

Locking the door behind her, as she finally entered her apartment, Lilly realized that she locked herself into her own home because of these problems. Because of men, she was always defending herself, taking preventative measures, modifying and shaping her behavior to account for how men behaved.

Car keys held like a weapon. Check the backseat before I get in the car. Don’t go out alone at night. Always adjusting jogging routes to avoid problem areas like a construction site. Locking the door when I came in, and making sure it’s still locked when I came home. Being careful not to drink too much.Don’t leave my drink and come back to it -- and watch it being made. Carry mace. Have a private number, unlisted. Use the automated voicemail voice so it’s not a woman’s voice. Park in well-lit areas and avoid garages. Don’t get into elevators with groups of men or only one man (not that i t can be avoided if he gets on after me). Don’t take a first floor apartment. Use a home alarm system. Don’t make eye contact with men on the street. Vary my route home. Don’t use highway rest areas. Put my hair under a hat…

Even after all this, Lilly still felt vulnerable, threatened. SHe had taken those classes on rape prevention, but they seemed like a fantasy idea. Besides, she knew that the “stranger in the bushes jumps out to rape lone jogger” notion was mostly a myth -- the vast majority of rapes were by people known to each other, or even by partners. It’s all well and good to train yourself to react to being grabbed in the park, but what are you going to do when you wake up to your boyfriend penetrating you while you sleep? Or when a guy gets “grabby” when you’re at a party? Self defense classes don’t cover what to do if your best friend’s boyfriend tries to kiss you and grab your breast in the hallway at her birthday party.

Looking down on the city, the people in the buildings, the pedestrians, the cars… Lilly realized a weird thing about her fears: after her wreck, she’d been scared of big trucks; but after that night in high school… she’d been scared of half the population. And that fear had never left.

A sudden thought occurred to her: I’ve always said “I was raped in high school”, but never “Dillan raped me when I was fifteen”! Why don’t we talk about the problem of men? No, it’s always rape as a “women’s issue”, isn’t it?

And Lilly began to look at herself anew, intentionally setting aside the way she evaluated herself, her life, as a woman for men. Just looked at herself as a person.

Lilly had a feeling she might have something else to say, a different reaction now, in any more elevator rides. She got out her phone, called the building manager and prepared to describe the “thing” that happened in the elevator. Lilly was done being scared. She was going to stand up for her half.
