**"The Tomb" by Dustin Clark**

There was a tomb on an island in the middle of a long lost see in the lands of a Forgotten people. It was said this tom was the tomb of the first man-Adam was his name. This story became a legend and it was told and retold for millions of years. Many "seekers" of this tomb journeyed to the island, but none ever made it back. Lost in the mists, the story became a myth. But, there was one man that was said to know the location of this lost tomb of Adam. He was old, so old that no one even knew exactly how old he was. They simply called him "Father" in his small village in the desert lands.

For a long time, people had come to him to ask for the knowledge of the secret tomb of the first man, but for years now, none had come and this saddened the old man. And so, empty years did come and go, until one day the people said, "Father, we bring you a seeker." They were excited to see the light come back into the old man's eyes. The "seeker was tall, but slim, fair-haired, and light of skin. The seeker kneeled before the father, and through a translator, he softly asked- "Father, I have come a long way and I seek the sacred knowledge of the tomb of the first man, please father, bless me with the secret location…"

And the father tapped the seeker on his chess with one long boney finger, and told the man, "The tomb is there… the tomb is there."
