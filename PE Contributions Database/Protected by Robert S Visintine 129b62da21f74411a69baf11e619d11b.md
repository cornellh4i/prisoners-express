**Protected by Robert S. Visintine**

At 30 years old my world came apart. My whole belief system was shattered. I was sentenced to 36 years and 3 months in federal prison for a money crime where there was no victim impact reported. Meaning no one was hurt. My first ever felony to conviction. I was sent to the U.S.P. Leavenworth to do my first five years in prison. Because I had never been to prison, this was a death sentence. It nearly was, twice, in my first week.

I always believed God protected those who had a good heart and loved God. I was certainly no cherub child who matured to an Angel. Nor was I the spawn of Satan. I suppose some may say the latter may be arguable. Nevertheless, I always enjoy helping people, being nice, enjoying life - the simplistic majestic beauty and wonder of creation. In my heart, I loved God.

I do have an active, creative mind, which never stops. I’m curious and have no fear of trying anything. Someone says, you can’t do that. Instinctively, I then have to try it. Compulsively, not rebelliousness, I just do it. Thus, I’ve seen troubling days. Never one like when this federal judge sentenced me.

I’m a free spirit. Prison was the worst thing that could happen to me. How could God let me be so stupid? I raged within. Why didn’t God protect me from being so stupid? Why did he allow me to throw my life away?

With this fate and destiny for my life, I could no longer believe in a God which loved and protected me. Why would I believe such anyway? I decided to do an in depth, exhaustive, objective study on religion. Where and when did they arise, and why?

Over the following twenty-four years, I learned and determined that we are more than physical body. More than, from dust to dust. This, a truth I feel one must experience and find for themselves. The how is not so important. For a truth is only truly known through personal experience. Otherwise, we are only parroting something we heard. Maybe, it tickled our ears, so we accept it as a truth. Or, possibly, it scares us, so the fear is accepted as a truth, and etc.

That is not to suggest, categorically, you must experience everything to know the truth of it. However, after twenty-three years into the thirty I had to do the sentence, I was diagnosed with a fatal cancer, with only a 40% chance of living five years. That of course would be under conditions I would never see in prison. I had several years left. This whole thing just kept getting worse. No way was I protected.

At the federal medical center, I became friends with a person who was searching for spiritual answers. He felt traditional religion had let him down, and had many unanswered questions. We ended up spending hours walking, where I shared with him what I had studied and learned. I shared what I had experienced and had seen.

I told him I didn’t have any answers. There is something, I’m sure. A creator or creative energy, I would think is reasonable to believe. But, names or organized religions, religious teaching, dogmas and beliefs were not absolutes. These, not worth the time, energy, nor breath to argue about. None of the strongly held beliefs, good deeds as a result of my faith in those beliefs, protected me.

I lost my adult life. When I get out, if I live that long, half my life will have been in prison. The difference in exactly half, from July 23rd to October 28th. A life devoid of love, compassion, kindness, forgiveness, affection, all the gifts of God, life.

The more we talked, the more I shared, my pessimism faltered. I heard my error. I expected to get something from life. My correct attitude, now realized, it is what we contribute to life, which empowers and satisfies our being. The very fact I was trying to help this person, after all of my calamities and near death experiences, was ample evidence, in fact, I have been protected all along. My heart was still loving and good.
