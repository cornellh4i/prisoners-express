Over the years, I have forgotten so many things. However, I still remember that since I was young, breakfast was always my favorite meal of the day. Breakfast was special on Saturdays.

Dad usually worked on Saturday's. When he did not, he always made breakfast. It was a simple but huge feast. The kids would help prepare it and dad would make eggs over easy, bacon, biscuits from the Pillsbury can, refried beans, sweet corn from the can, and freshly made french fries. Sometimes breakfast would take over an hour to prepare from start to finish, yet it was well worth the wait.

When I purchased breakfast it was usually at one of four restaurants that I always went to. At each restaurant I had my signature plate and did not have to order it as the wait staff already knew what I wanted. There were three high end and casual restaurants that I frequented for breakfast. Café Brazil is a chain restaurant but you wouldn't know it unless you knew more than one existed. Each one looks slightly similar yet unique at the same time. I always had the Brazilian Breakfast there. It consisted of a meat stuffed empanada, spiced potatoes, and two eggs with toast. My favorite thing was the unlimited coffee. They have about fifty different types of coffee. Everyday about fourteen would be chosen to have ready. If you wanted a particular coffee, they would grind the beans and make you your own half pot of coffee.

Dragonfly was where I had a ridiculously expensive waffle, but it was worth it. It was about a ten inch waffle cut and arranged sort of like a teepee. It has lots of warm strawberry and raspberry slices on top along with lots of rich whipped butter. On the side was three different kinds of high end syrup. To drink I always had a mimosa.

At Craft, breakfast would usually take a while since that provided me with the Wall Street Journal. I only read that newspaper when I was at Craft. My signature plate was two eggs over easy, spiced potatoes, sort of a chopped beef barbeque like meat, and toast. To drink I always had a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and freshly blended apple juice.

At Breadwinners I always had a selection of the day's pastries. Breadwinners is a high-end bakery and restaurant. Along with the pastries I would have a ham omelet and a glass of champagne and wine.

Today I hate all my meals. Breakfast is probably the one I hate the most. Today I guess my entire breakfast was 75 calories. They gave us two boiled eggs that were extremely small. I don’t understand how chickens can even lay eggs so small. The piece of cornbread was one by two by half of one inch thick. Whoever heard of being served cornbread for breakfast?
