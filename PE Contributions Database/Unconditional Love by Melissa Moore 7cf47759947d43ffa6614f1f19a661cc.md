**Unconditional Love by Melissa Moore**

Everyone needs some help sometime. Well, with me, I need help a lot of the time. I’ve found that there are only two people on this planet that have my back no matter what. I guess it’s that unconditional love of parents: mine are those kinds of parents - AWESOME.

Now don’t get me wrong. During my teenage years I believed they stayed up at night plotting the best way to ruin my life and make me miserable. That they experienced some sort of bliss by telling me no. I realize that they only had my best interests at heart. They may not have liked me all that much, but they ALWAYS loved me.

The first time I got into trouble with the law I spent less than a week in jail; I was eighteen. My mother spoke with a friend at the DA’s office and was able to get me into a program called DA Diversion. My parents paid all the fees and all of my restitution. I completed the program and the charge doesn’t show on my record. My dad told me that was the only time they would ever get me out and if I did go back not ask them to bond me out. The answer would be no.

I found that under this diversion program it would be better to move away; new place, new ways. My boyfriend (who later became my boys’ daddy) and I moved to Houston, Texas. Shortly after arriving, we had a drug connection. Guess you can not run from your problems after all. I couldn’t even begin to count how many times my parents paid our bills - they never said no.

I found myself in jail again. You know the first person I called - my mommy. She promptly informed me that they would not be getting me out; my dad always does what he says he will or does not do what he says he will not. However, they did put money on my books.

Now, my kids’ father and our two boys did move back to Louisiana. My parents allowed them to live at their house. My children were now attending church and had positive role models. I knew they would be loved and cared for by their daddy and my parents. When I was released from jail in Houston, my parents came and picked me up for the 12AM release. They purchased my psych meds and we spent the night with relatives. The next morning we headed back home.

For a little while I was sober. Then, I started using again. My parents basically looked over it. They kept taking the boys to church and instilling values in my children. It seemed the more I mess up, the more I was in and out of jail, they worked harder to let my kids know right from wrong and more than anything that they were loved. All three of them.

I got out of jail again. This time I just knew I was going to stay out. I had grown tired of that sort of life. I didn’t want to commit any more crimes, no matter the type. I; however, did anyway. I moved in with a man that everyone from my parole officer, to my parents, to my friends told me to stay away from. Love makes you do some stupid things. I still wasn’t breaking any laws. Well, other than that whole no-contact order, and my love blinded me to his actions.

I am back in jail now - have been for two and a half years. Hopefully, I will get out soon. My parents are still here for me. I’ve learned; however, that their love and kindness are better than all the money in the world. They make me feel loved when I feel hated. They comfort me when this jail life gets to me. They care when my feelings get trampled.

There are many monetary debts I owe my parents that they do not expect payback on. The biggest debt there is between us is the fact that they have never and will never abandon me. I have their love for life.
