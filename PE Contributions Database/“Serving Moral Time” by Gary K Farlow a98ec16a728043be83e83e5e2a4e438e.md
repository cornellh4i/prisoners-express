**“Serving Moral Time” by Gary K Farlow**

Part of the Jaycee Creed reads that “Service to humanity is the best work of life.” Today’s rising crime rates and an ever-growing prison population make it easy to overlook the many inmates who put forth the effort to “give back” to the community.

Earthquakes are fairly common in California, but typically only the major tremors make the news. The quake that rocked San Francisco in the early 1990s occurred while I was at the Caledonia Prison Farm in the coastal plains of North Carolina. At the time, and unlike many other prisons in the state, Caledonia did not have an “Inmate Service Club” such as a Jaycees chapter. But it did have two inmates named “Big Sam” and L.A.”

Obviously, L.A. was a native of Los Angeles, who had grown up in the streets of the East Side Barrios in the City of Angels. Big Sam’ name suited him well. At more than 250 pounds, Sam was a former jeweler from St. Louis whose love for gold must have had to do something with the “golden heart” he possessed toward his fellow man.

“Hey, L.A., wake up Man,” I heard Sam say early one morning. “A big quake rocked San Francisco last night, and the city’s a mess.”

L.A. bolted out of bed and sat mesmerized by the scenes of utter devastation playing across the TV screen. As the horror of what a major earthquake could bring sank into the minds of the inmates gathered around the TV, the minds of L.A. and Big Sam were already focusing on the aftermath.

“Hey, Man! What’s up?” came the cries of protest as L.A. stepped up and flipped the TV off. He calmly raised his hands. Amazingly, the protests ebbed to hear what he had to say.

“Look, guys, most of you know I’m from Los Angeles. I don’t know how many of you have ever lived through an earthquake, so let me tell you. There’s no fear like it. Those people out there have lost everything. They’re gonna need some help.”

“Help?” said one young inmate. “Hey, Dude, that’s what the government’s for.”

“Yeah,” spoke up another. “They got the Red Cross and stuff, that’ll help ‘em out.”

“Right,” still another said. “And we’re just a bunch of convicts. What can we do anyway?”

Not discouraged, L.A. listened to what everyone had to say, then he spoke. “Fellas, I’ll grant that we’re all prisoners who society feels have little to contribute, but this is an opportunity for us not only to prove such a belief wrong but also to give something of ourselves. To serve some ‘moral time,’” L.A. stated.

“Moral time?” asked one of the gathered inmates. “What are you talking about, L.A.?”

“What I’m talking about is doing something for someone else. Not because we have to but because we want to. Doing the right thing. Helping another person in need.”

“Just how do you plan for us to go about it?” asked Big Sam, his interest clearly reflected in the faces of about 30 fellow inmates who had been listening to the exchange.

“Well,” began L.A., “none of us has a lot of money.”

This statement was quickly met with nods and groans of agreement. The typical inmate in North Carolina earns an “incentive wage” of either 40 or 70 cents a day.

“But,” L.A. continued, “we can raise some money.”

L.A. and Big Sam put together a fundraising campaign that included the sale of donuts, pizza, and even a car wash where prison staff could get their automobiles washed and waxed. The entire prison, inmates and staff, were quickly galvanized into unity with the goal of raising money to provide some relief to the victims of San Francisco’s recent quake.

In just two months, a little more than $2000 was raised and sent to the San Francisco Earthquake Relief Fund. A sense of positive accomplishment prevailed over the prisoners who learned the pleasure of giving selflessly to others and the joy and peace it brings. Random acts of kindness replaced acts of violence as prisoners shared a common goal, working with prison staff to help the suffering thousands of miles away.

On the day that the check was placed in the mail, the warden had the kitchen serve a special breakfast to celebrate the achievement. As inmates sat down with the staff to share donuts, ham biscuits, and fresh fruit, everyone was reminded of the brotherhood of mankind. Such a brotherhood supersedes the superficial divisions of man from man, inmates from free citizens, one status from another status. We all learned that “service to humanity is the best work of life.”
