**Kaunis Suomi: Beautiful Finland by Catherine Lafleur**

One day, I was sitting in Delta’s common room at Camp Prisoney Land. The television was broadcasting the final minutes of the Tour de France, a famed bicycle race. There were many signs advertising the sponsors. An acquaintance sitting next to me remarked the words printed on the banner at the finish line had an extra N. I said, "Dear, that is not misspelled, it's an advertisement for a Finnish sports gear company.”

Spending six months in Finland was an experience. This Scandinavian country stands between Sweden and Russia. You can eat a lot of bread in Finland. Along with bread, Finns like milk. The most popular form is piimä, Delicious soured milk. Yummy tummy indeed! Expect to be offered this beverage at all meals or as a refresher. Try not to wrinkle your nose. Eventually it will grow on you and won't be so noticeable. There's also plenty of coffee (kahvi). Lots and lotslotslotslots!  so you will be surrounded by other caffeinated people. Sure, they are caffeinated Lutherans but also silent for the most part. Of course people talk just not so much in public. While walking around one of the smaller cities, Kanjaani, it felt eerie that not many people were having conversations. It's not like New York where you can overhear people talking, sometimes in the most annoying way. So lower your voice otherwise you will be thought rude or drunk. Or both.

Silence is golden in Suomi (Finland). It is not unfriendly at all. When you do find someone to have a conversation with, be prepared for the looooooong pause. Don't make the mistake of thinking the conversation is over. The Finn is just considering what has been said, the response may take a while to come. Do not try talking again. Wait for it... Wait for it.

I went on a week-long hike in Lapland with a brother and sister guide team, Satu and Pekka (it was an effort not to mistakenly call him Pekinese).  Lackland is where reindeer live. There's a lot of lichen growing there. But there are also vast places of such stark beauty that talking seems sacrilege (väärä). The guides told me people come there to think deep thoughts (miettä).  I did ask questions. What is this flower? What is that bird? Etc. I must have seemed a chatterbox. This photo reminds me of Lapland. You can be hiking along and suddenly there are the remains of a lone building rising out of the earth like it was planted there. The beauty of the landscape, the aloneness of it all, make you feel refreshed. I think of Finland and the joys to be found in silence often here at Camp Prisoney Land.
