**“Flowers” by Johnny Mahaffey**

When I first gave the prompt “flowers” to my creative writing students they were a little reluctant. But, after we talked about it in class, everyone realized the significance of flowers in our current predicament.

On April 15th, at approximately 7:00 PM, a series of tornadoes touched down, and a large portion of the mid-state area (South Carolina) lost electrical services. By 7:15 PM, a gang war broke out at the Lee Correctional Institution, with one group going on a murder spree up until 11:30 PM when outside law enforcement finally arrived, bringing the Lee Correctional Institution back to “normal operations” by about 2:00 AM. When it was all said and done- seven were dead and twenty-two were in need of the emergency room. It’s being called the Lee Correctional Massacre.

It was a bloodbath!

Ages of the murdered range from 24 to 44, with only two of them eligible for parole- the rest were without hope. South Carolina senators are now arguing about how prisoners in the state are obviously mistreated. The state gives out too many life sentences without the chance of parole- and as a result, cells are sardine-packed with prisoners- that the state dehumanizes with the term “inmate”- that have no hope.

And humans without hope are dangerous.

When a prisoner dies, if their body is not claimed and paid for- yes, paid for, covering any of the state’s expenses- then it is burned up into ash, put in a bag, and spread out over a designated prison grave area. No flowers.

Flowers are for people.

The Lee Correctional Massacre just may be a flower in disguise- perhaps now, with so much national attention, prison conditions and sentencing will change.

No, we don’t think much of flowers. But that’s only because our state only sees us as what they call us- “inmates”- with numbers assigned that they can add to their collective for claiming their “share” of the tax jar. It’s all about the budget- rehabilitation or empathetic sentencing costs money and effort- it’s about what’s cost effective to the status quo. Flowers for the seven dead and twenty-two injured would mean compassion. But flowers cost money…
