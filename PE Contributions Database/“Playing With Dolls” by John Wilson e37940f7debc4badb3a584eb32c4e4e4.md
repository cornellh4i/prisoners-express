**“Playing With Dolls” by John Wilson**

I wandered down Carnival Row, musing over my problem. Obeah had the book and I wanted it. But his protective measures stopped me from getting it. Simple as that. I could dress it up as a moral fable, saying that he used its magic for self-gratification and evil while I wouldn’t, but…

I stopped at a table held by an old woman wrapped in colorful scarves. Probably a Gypsy, with her nut-dark skin, though her hair was entirely white. The two dolls on her table commanded my attention. Six inches tall, vague human shapes cut from burlap, dark mats of horse hair sewn on their head, and filled with what felt like a mixture of dried beans and rice. They reminded me of a Dean Koontz novel I’d read years ago, and that gave me an idea on how to get my book. And hey, if it didn’t work I could always make a meal out of their stuffing.

“How much?” I asked as I lifted the poppets.

She leaned across the table and took my hand to look at the palm. “A man of the art. Shouldn’t sell to you — no telling what mischief you plan.” I smiled.

“None to you or yours, none to any of the Traveling Folk.”

“You know our ways.” She held out a hand and I put a five in it and used two quarters to trace out an invoking Earth pentagram over the money before dropping those into her hand as well.

Once home, I went straight to my workshop. I traced the pentagrams in each quarter, then the rose crosses at each cross-quarter as well as above and below me. They flared brilliantly in my astral sight. From there, I censed the circle with Fire and Air, then aspersed it with Water and Earth. I called the energy of each element into the circle through the pentagrams, and from there drew it into my body. Preparations complete, I turned to the task at hand.

I needed the poppets of a size large enough to handle the book yet small enough to hide easily — child-sized, perhaps eight to ten years old. They needed enough mind to remember and follow orders, and improvise a bit to meet the situation, but not so much they became independent. They need the spark of life without a living soul. I had to make two golems, one of the most difficult operations in all magickal lore.

It took me longer than I imagined, drawing the currents of astral light through the hexagrams and currents of elemental force through the pentagrams and stranger currents through figures of non-Euclidean angles. But at last I was done. I watched the two explore their new world with their rudimentary senses, clumsy and curious. When I moved, their heads swiveled to watch and they mimicked me perfectly as I de-energized and took down the circle.

Over the next several weeks I trained them with a steady video diet of Olympic sprinting, parkour, and “American Ninja Warrior.” At night I would take them out and test their abilities. I’d time their runs and put magickal traps for them to avoid. When they started to meet my standards, I made it more difficult.

The night of their last run, they exceeded my best expectations. “Good, very good.” My praise sent them into an impromptu rendition of the Three Stooges routine. Perhaps I let them watch too much TV. Sometimes their behavior reminded me of Thing One and Thing Two, and I resolved to never let them see that movie. I never could break them of mimicking unnecessary actions, like bending over to catch their breath after a run even though they didn’t breathe. The wrong movie could give them too many bad habits, and I’d only reinforced the ones they had by laughing at their antics.

They were ready. I sent them out the next night.

The dynamic duo returned in the wee hours before dawn, proudly holding the large, heavy book between them; scarred, singed, and smelling of burnt falafel, oddly enough. I took the time, their blank, half-suggested faces peering at me hopefully.

“Well done. Very, very good.” They capered around me while I examined my new book. It was the right one, except for the locked clasp that held the cover together. That wasn’t supposed to be there. Obeah had certainly added that, and it was likely magicked to destroy the book if I attempted to pick it or bypass it. Well, at least I have the book and Obeah doesn’t, but…

I turned to my terrible two, placing a hand on their heads and drawing on their power until they shrank in on themselves returning to their original size. “Well done, faithful servants, sleep… sleep until I shall need you again, sleep until I have a new task for you.”
