**Helping Hand (Me!) by Detrick Shaw**

In all ways, but late-ly emotionally! People need people. Even when others will not lend a helping hand. Is always me! So as I sit in this cell perhaps God is my helping hand, cause Mommy is dead. I feel alone in this world looking between these bars out the window. Pondering. “Every human being is a puzzle and I need to learn how to be the missing piece. They will give you everything.” So you should be more like me. Be someone’s helping hand!!!
