“Little P.O.W.’s Need Protected” by Steven Lee Adkins Jr.

Being a warrior and a prisoner that stands 6 feet tall and weighs 260 pounds, I was able to stand up for myself twice in August of 2017. Both occasions merely three days apart, a POW fighting his captors because they had wronged and mistreated me. I don’t try to sell myself as a good guy. A quote from Stephen Segal would better describe me, “I’m a bad guy with good intentions.”

My good intentions have been focused on a foe that I cannot travel to and exterminate. This foe I now see wronging innocent people is the corrupt law and government officials of Iran. I have an eye for those things. I watched our warden here at MOCC in WV recently fired, as was our WVDOC commissioner and some lower ranking officials, all corrupt and tyrannical, fired or made to resign recently.

These powerful people in Iran allow rape to go virtually unpunished and I read in a newspaper that the governing law of Iran even publicly hung a woman who had (in my opinion she righteously claimed justice) killed the man who had been her rapist.

Now it’s come to my attention that between 2005 and 2015, 73 children were executed by the governing law of Iran and right now there are 160 Iranian children on death row, awaiting their executions because of minor and petty crimes they committed, for example speaking aloud their opinions.

‘Crimes’ that most children’s parents wouldn’t even raise their voices over here in America. As a prisoner writing my opinion openly about my disgust of child killers, such as those in Iran, I would be promptly murdered if I were writing from an Iranian cell, instead of the US cell I reside in.

I am locked in this small box for about 165 hours of each week. I cannot acquire the attire of my nature--the sword, the shield, and the spear--that the blood of my ancestors coursing through my veins years for, but would make do with a gun and body armor and would wage continued battle upon these child killers if I could.

But it will be years before I am free. I love and protect children, so my only weapon today against these distant child killing foes is my pen. To make those aware who aren’t aware of these facts that can easily be validated with small efforts, and possible awareness will lead to action.

I’m spreading said awareness to many organizations and legislature. It’s the most I can do, which I will always do. Better than being among the cowards Teddy Roosevelt spoke of, those that never risk much nor achieve much. These captive children cannot stand up for themselves. These little POW’s need protection.
