**“When Life Gives You Shit. Make Pie” by Yankee Lawyer**

“Shit” is a four-letter word. It is much abused, abused by vulgar young men who speak it frequently without regard to its proper meaning, abused by old biddies who prefer big Latin words like “excrement.” The old Anglo-Saxon words have been taboo for 953 years.

I don’t give a shit! Or should I say “crap.” or “dung”? Hell, they’re all 4-letter words! Oh well, “Shit” is an onomatopoeia. It comes about as close as you can get to the sound of a foot stepping into a fresh dropping, and it’s much easier to say than “excrement.”

Especially when you’re mad.

Have you ever seen any barefoot gentleman or lady step on a cowpie and say “Oh, excrement!”? I thought not.

When I was a boy exploring my neighborhood in New England. Bowler's Farm came within a mile of my house. Getting through the barbed wire fence was easy, but hazards lurked beyond.

My big brothers told me not to be afraid of the cows, just beware of any bulls; but when I saw a half ton of beef on the hoof ambling toward me, I wasn’t about to reach down and check her udder (or other parts). I ran.

Running through the trees at the edge of a cow pasture often proved to be a mistake.

There were other animals around, whose calling cards were smaller but still hard to get out from between the toes: dogs, cats, deer, squirrel, coons…. I spent a lot of time cleaning my feet.

As a young man wrestling cattle, I always wore expensive cowboy boots. They would get really messy, but I always had them cleaned up and shining before time for church on Sunday.

Sometimes we package cow shit, buy and sell it, and mix into the soil in our gardens. Then we call it manure. That’s a good word. But if any of my children tracked it through the dining room, I would not say “Oh, manure!”

Pamela said she loved me and made all kinds of promises. That was a crock of shit. She collected my sperm and my money; now, I’m a political prisoner in a Carolina plantation.

Shit is good for many things, not just fertilizer. I’m not sure how they do it now, but for a thousand years, gunpowder was made from old bot droppings. In *The Help,* a maid baked a “chocolate” pie with her secret ingredient and fed it to an aggressive employer. I have been unable to obtain her recipe, but I am the same person who used to walk across pine cones, jagged shale, and swan and goose droppings but refused to wear shoes.

Life has handed me a pile of shit. I do not choose to step in it and spend the rest of my days scrubbing between my toes and feeling sorry for myself. Not as long as I can drop my drawers and make a few piles of my own.
