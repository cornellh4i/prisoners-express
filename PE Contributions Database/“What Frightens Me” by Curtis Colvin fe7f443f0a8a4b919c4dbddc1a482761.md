**“What Frightens Me” by Curtis Colvin**

Sometimes facing my fears scares me. What kind of fears, you should ask. Well I guess I’ll share a little of my inner thoughts with you.

My main fear is to die here in prison without ever getting out. I want to be free again, to be able to do what I want when I want to. There are goals I have set for myself to attain spirituality that I cannot do while in here. A lot has to do with my Mormon faith.

My next fear is for one of my sisters or good friends to die while I’m in here. To miss out on being with one who might pass away, without me showing my true love for them, makes me sick and depressed.

But my greatest fear right now is parole. That’s right, I said parole. After being in here for over 20 years, I’m scared that I won’t find a job, a place of my own, or any support to help me do so. I truly don’t want to end up back in here. God willing, I’ll get a positive answer, for I’ve seen parole back in May, and I’ll have to face this fear. At least I’ll do it with a smile on my face!
