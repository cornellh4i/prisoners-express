**“Sea of the Daybreak Harp” by Todd Leathervand**

The scribe sat on the dock in the stillness of the dawn. A stillness inexplicable. Little stirred as if Adonai himself had calmed the world; like a midwife hushing a suckling child. Never had he witnessed the harp sea this calm. Perhaps it was due to the man who bore open his soul not two days past.

He flexed his fingers as the crystalline notes of a harp being played in the distance rippled in his heart. Penetrating. Revealing. He felt no pain in his hands, as he contemplated his ink-stained fingers. His parchments could wait. This dawn was different. He had been healed.

Tinges of sunrise brilliance began to emerge, painting the lofty clouds floating purposefully over the Sea of Galilee. The slanting light recalled the man’s words to his mind’s eye. Overwhelmed by their power, the scribe had felt compelled to pursue the remarkable man, making the declaration, “I will follow you wherever you go.”

The wondrous man had responded with the words, “Foxes have holes and the birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.” These words were now convicting the scribe’s soul.

Surely no man had ever spoken like this, with words that cut to the quick - alive and invigorating, uncovering the buried intents of his heart, which had been securely nestled in the sanctuary of his library.

The harp’s melodic notes resonated in his mind.

Streaks of tangerine peeled over the horizon, arching overhead, resembling Egyptian linen embroidered with the golden threads of Ophir - draped across a mahogany table.

His thoughts easily flowed to his beloved library in pursuit of his scrolls, where the scribe had found so much security in the past - finding definition and purpose through the structure of language - the acquisition of knowledge. There, his introversy was hedged in by dusty tomes and the musk of vellum. The long hours spent perfecting the form and precision of the letters, the exactness of the process, illuminated by the alert flame of an olive oil lamp. Even now he sought its solace, but the stirring of his heart and the sea…

“Peace be still.”

An inclination towards the heart now dwelling within him. Could this be the reason for the supernatural dawn?

He allowed the harp’s permeating melody to capture him...like the man’s words. Just like the sun’s dazzling rays displayed amongst the effortless clouds, gliding in their golden splendor.

Could he really follow this man? The Messiah?

A seed had been planted deep in the soil of his soul; his spirit was responding - engulfing his heart.

High above the mirror smooth water an eagle soared on a thermal current.

“I can see it, Abba, way up there. I want to fly like that someday! The scribe’s son exclaimed from behind him.

In his meditations, the scribe had not heard his little footsteps approaching on the dock.

“Is this really what colors are?”

The sun’s warmth was finding them both, encompassing them

“Before I could see them, I dreamed heaven looked like this,” said the son.

“You can still see now, lad?” the scribe asked his son, who had found his way toward him and settled in his lap. “The man, Yoshua, really opened your eyes then?”

“Oh yes, Abba. I never knew life was like this before,” the son said wistfully. “I see the clouds and the sea - the beautiful sunrise - and I see you too, and myself.”

Looking down at the water to their reflection on the tranquil surface, father contemplated his son and the son his father. Resembling one another, they were an exact representation of the other - expressed in the form of a seed.

The scribe’s thoughts, again, followed after the man, only briefly, then paused. His son’s eyes searched for his own, as he stroked the coarse texture of his greying beard.

“Abba, will you teach me to know the letters and write like you?” His son inquired hopefully.

The scribe thought; finally, I will be able to impress upon my son the wisdom of the Torah and the revelation of the Hebrew language. The miraculous man had done much for him indeed. He spoke a silent prayer in thanks to the Most High as he lifted his son up onto his shoulders.

The hard’s chords began to cause ripples to stir upon the awakening sea. Glinting across the expanse of this ambition of nature was a radiant daybreak shimmer, bursting on the horizon, causing the Galil to come to life.

“Absolutely, my son,” with tenderness in his voice. “I have been waiting your whole life to hear those words.”
