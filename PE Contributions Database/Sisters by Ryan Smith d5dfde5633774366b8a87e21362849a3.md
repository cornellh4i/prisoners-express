**Sisters by Ryan Smith**

A miracle occured last week. We were given celery sticks along with our breakfast. I personally have never had celery sticks while incarcerated. To complete the miracle, we happened to have them on a day when peanut butter accompanied the fronch toast. Naturally, I put the peanut butter on the celery.

It took me back to a time of innocence and bliss; when the pressures of society had no bearing in my life. Back then my sister and I could be found in the backyard, hunting for caterpillars. We could be found in the kitchen, saturated with sugar, incessantly making each other laugh and cry. I have very fond memories of my sister. I remember holding the permanent marker in my hand, but having no thought in my head as I ruined the sheets. How clever I was when I demonstrated to my dad that those scribbles were hers, not mine! Years later, when she was in middle school, I cut off her bangs while she was sleeping. Oh, how she must have hated that I treated her so nefariously.

I cannot recall any reason for the way that I treated her. I can say, though, that she is the only woman in this world, besides my mother, whom I would do anything for. I love that girl tremendously. Now, she has a different last name and I know nothing about her. I will continue to reach out to her with the hope that she will allow me to try to ameliorate our relationship. In the interim, I patiently wait for another miracle in the form of peanut butter and celery, hoping to reminisce about better days of long ago.
