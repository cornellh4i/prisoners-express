**"Aging" by Henry Stephens**

Aging to me is a privilege, not a right. Cause I have seen some die at a young age, which to me was a blessing. They didn't have to go though this old world of trial and tribulation. I know everyone want to age with their kids, but the Supreme Being had another mission for them. {"May peace and blessing be among them all"}

Aging is not all bad; there are some beautiful aspects of aging. Like growing up from a boy to a man, or a girl to a woman. The older you get the wiser you get. Then you can sit back and reminisce on all the stupid things you did when you were young, and that's something to put a smile on your face bigger than the United States. If you give a good life, you'll live a good life; that's just my conception. I have encountered death a few times myself. But on the same token, I've saved a few lives also, so I guess the Supreme Being gives back to the giving.

I am of no religion, but my belief is in a supreme being. I'm a very devout person, and I believe that if you follow the common sense that God gave you, you'll continue to age a long time. You can't be taught common sense, you're born with common sense; it's the sense to know right from wrong.

All this is in aging. I've made some bad decisions myself, but you learn from your mistakes. Experience is the best teacher in aging.
