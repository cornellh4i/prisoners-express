**“Eddie’s Leap of Faith” by Edward Walsh**

A friend of Eddie’s had talked to him about a time in his life where it was a matter of taking a leap of faith. Eddie heard of the expression many times in his 59 years of life but never associated it with anything that had to do with his personal life. The next morning, as Eddie sat in bed with a cup of mint tea sitting on his night stand, he reflected on his past. “Have I ever had a leap of faith? Have I ever done a leap of faith? Just what is a leap of faith anyway?”

Eddie thought back to when he was a teenager. When he had to start making life decisions or choices on his own. When, in 1976 after he graduated, he joined the Navy. He didn’t have much of a choice in joining. After coming home one day, stoned and drunk, his step-father met him at the front door of his home.

“Where do you think you’re going?” His step-father asked.

Eddie looked up at him, and his blue eyes were bloodshot red. With slurred speech, he managed to say, “To my room.”

“No, you don’t live here anymore.” His step-father said as he handed Eddie a slip of paper. He took the paper and read what was written on it. “I suggest you give these people a call. I’ll give you a week. Then you’re out.”

Eddie looked up at his step-father then back down at the list of military recruitment offices with their addresses. He walked past him then went to his room, closed the door, and sat on his bed. No, he didn’t have a choice; it was either the mean streets of Miami or the military. No leap of faith in that.

Eddie’s life began when he moved out for boot camp. That’s when he had to start making choices and decisions on his own. A lot by guess work, a lot by trial and error. And throughout the 40 years since he moved out of his step-father’s house, he’s made more life changing decisions and choices, both good and bad, than he cared to remember. That morning, sitting in his bed and sipping his mint tea, Eddie tried to reminisce on them all.

“Faith… Faith in what? In God, Jesus, or some Higher Power? I’ve read the Bible many times, and one of the key themes is faith. Faith, God’s will, Jesus the Savior… Faith. Is it faith in myself? That I can do whatever it is that I’m destined to do? Faith that I’m capable? Faith that I can achieve? That I can survive? That I will be accepted? What about faith in whatever it is that I’m leaping into? Will it work out? Will it be acceptable to both myself and others? Will I or it be successful? Makes me think of all the years I’ve been drunk and stoned. Did I not have faith in… Whatever? Faith… HA!”’

Eddie got out of bed and got dressed. He picked up a pad of writing paper, a pencil, and a pen. Then he clipped his MP4 player to his belt and put the earbuds in his ears. He walked outside to the courtyard where he lived to sit in the sun and get some fresh air. He wanted to ponder more on this leap of faith and maybe write an essay on the subject. Sitting in the sun with a cool breeze blowing, he watched the people in the complex as they walked about and sat at tables to talk, read, or play games.

“I have faith that this essay will make sense and be good enough to be published. And writing this essay and submitting it will be my leap of faith.” Eddie said to himself then laughed. “I think a leap of faith will be something bigger than a simple essay. Something major. A life determining choice.

“Think, think. What in my life did I do that was a leap of faith? What did I do that I was frightened of, not sure of the outcome. Something that I did that was life changing?”

Then it came to him. One of the most significant life changing decisions he’s ever made. A decision, a choice, a leap of faith. He wasn’t sure of what the results would be. Eddie hasn’t had to make this leap of faith only once: he’s made this same leap of faith over and over since the year 1990.

Eddie is gay. He had always hidden his true sexuality from his family and friends. He had hidden his true sexuality though his childhood and teen years, and most challengingly, through the 12 years in the Navy and his two marriages. He lived a frustrating lie. It wasn’t until he was out of the Navy, divorced, and in college and at the age of 33 that Eddie decided to start living the life he had longed to live for so long. In 1990, he decided to take a leap of faith, the leap that those that he chose to tell of his sexuality would still accept him. No matter if they were family or friends, or just acquaintances, the faith that everything would work out for the best. And 20 years later, Eddie still takes that leap of faith. “HELLO WORLD. I’M GAY!”
