**“My Mountain” by Craig Shipley**

When I see this photo of the mountains, it reminds me of prison life. There are always us and downs and unexpected pitfalls, trails, and paths.

There is beauty, even behind these walls. I’ve learned that I am a good listener, that I really care about people, and that I like to share. Being sober and not telling lies are good feelings.

My mountains will lead to my freedom one of these days.
