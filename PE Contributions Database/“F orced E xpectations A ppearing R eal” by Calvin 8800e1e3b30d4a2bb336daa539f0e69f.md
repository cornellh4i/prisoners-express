**“F.orced E.xpectations A.ppearing R.eal” by Calvin Westerfield**

Almost all fear is fear of the unknown. We fear what we don’t understand. There is nothing healthy about fear, as it is the cause of all kinds of worry, stress, anxiety, and ultimately leads to failure. This is not to say that fear is not normal. Fear is what triggers the fight, flight, or freeze response in the brain that gets people through many obstacles they face. The negative aspect of this passion is when your mind denies this response in the brain, signaling the body to react a certain way. When it’s time to fight a battle, but you decide to flee instead, this inability to face that obstacle makes you a coward. Fear robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning. Facing your fear is the only way to overcome it. Sadly, many people have fears so deeply embedded in their minds that they will always be victims to this illusion.

“Courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to carry on with dignity in spite of it.” - Scott Turow. In prison, you have two people: predators and prey. Naturally, the predator seeks out those who appear to be afraid or weak because they are easy targets. They play on their victims’ fear, invent a mock situation to heighten the guys’ fear, then offer their “protection” for a fee. This scenario gets played out daily in this hostile environment, but every now and then, an example is made out of the wolf for mistaking its prey to be a lamb when he’s really a lion! These are joyous events for us who love to see a bully defeated. No one would be victims to this predacious behavior in prison if they would just stand up to their fear of being harmed. Violence is not always the answer, but at the end of the day, all men breathe the same air and bleed the same blood. To do the thing you are afraid of is to overcome that fear. It’s that simple. Fear is wholly a mental illusion and only has the power we give it.

The number one cause of racism in America stems from ignorance. Even using the term “race” shows this lack of understanding because our race is human. We are of the human race! All from Africa at the end of the day. How simple is the mind of those who fear their own race based on the shade of skin. My only fear is ignorance.
