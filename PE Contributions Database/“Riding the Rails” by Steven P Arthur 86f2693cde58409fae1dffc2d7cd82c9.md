**“Riding the Rails” by Steven P. Arthur**

The vibrations, hums, squeaks and *clack, clack, clack* sounds from a slight lateral shimmy unique train cars that are going over the steel tracks wake me gently and slowly. Familiar sounds and smells alight on me like early sunrise. There is no home in the traditional, white picket fence sense. The world is my residence, each night I sleep in a new home, under a different root of wood or stars. I have little money, but I forbid you to call me poor. Staying on the move is my innate employment; coded into my DNA if you will, searching for that unattainable missing piece to fill an indescribable void. That is my job, but nothing I would call work. My philosophy.

The international railways are my primary mode of transportation when my feet lack the motivation for locomotion. I stare out watching the world whip by in a blur. So fast. Why the need? Doesn’t life go fast enough? A cosmic eye blink.

Once I had a dress - I was a successful corporate lawyer with a pregnant wife who had the most amazing hazel eyes, and two little ones that looked like miniature versions of me and my beautiful wife. But it was only a dream. Nothing that real could have been so easily wiped away by an inebriated driver of a 1988 Buick Skylark: a car. The most dangerous method of travel was going the wrong way on a two-lane highway. No, just a fever dream. Another life in an alternate universe in the multiverse. For another man, another me. Not me.
