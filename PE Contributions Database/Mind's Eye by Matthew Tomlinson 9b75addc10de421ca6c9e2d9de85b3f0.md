**“Mind’s Eye” by Matthew Tomlinson**

Everybody knows about radio waves, though nobody has seen one. Everybody knows radio waves can project your voice anywhere across Terra via cell phones or the internet. We, prisoners have no access to cell phones or computers. Yet, we know they exist. No need to review the works of Hertz, Faraday, Edison, or others. Everybody knows. No need to review my product “An Elsie Oscillator Can Thwart The Walls of Isolation” for the November 2017 theme “Thwarted”. Everybody who needs to know how to produce radio waves either does know or could learn from other sources.

Most people know your mind produces radio waves. Since you have access to those emanations, then why not use them? Why can’t you project those radio waves across Terra? You could learn to do that. You could learn to control the radio waves of your mind.

The radio waves of your mind can be called Mind’s eye. You’ve said: “I can picture that. I can see it in my Mind’s Eye.” You truly can. You can establish a Mind’s Eye link, like a radio link, anywhere across Terra. That’s the difference between the common Terra you see and the Terra for the glorious; Terra Cognizant it can be. It’s merely a matter of how you view things.

My cohorts refuse to walk that razor’s edge between Terra and Terra Cognizant. People here at Bill Clements Major Psychiatric Unit of Texas Department of Criminal Justice are too unstable to balance on that thin line. They could. They refuse. We have 24 hours a day to do anything a prison cell permits. Prefabricated cement walls with concrete floors contain and restrain those of us who might stumble off the razor’s edge. We’ll always have a rock-solid place to return. None of my cohorts dare to project Mind’s Eye beyond the narrow confines of imagination. They could. They won’t.

Prisoner Express offers the “Buddhist Meditation Guide”. This is Tara’s eight packet of tips and insights into practical techniques and inspirations for successful meditation. Prisoner Express also sent me the book “Universal Kabbalah” by Sheldon Stoff, Jesse Stoff, and Lorraine Stoff. The book offers forms of guided visualizations. It points out on page 12 that there are two methods to attain a higher level of consciousness or a mystical state. There is meditation and there are drugs. On page 14, the book points out that when we pray, we speak to the Spiritual World; when we meditate, we listen. Mind’s Eye allows full duplex conversations with the Spiritual World.

Mind’s Eye alarms some shallow-minded people. At 0110 hours on Thursday, November 2, 2017, one day before the Full Moon, a guard named Weatherford decided she couldn’t see me breathing. She banged on the door of my cell. My cohort is in administrative segregation and they normally bang on their cell doors all night long. The noise brought no response. She radioed for a sergeant. He banged on my cell door. There was no response. The sergeant radioed for a lieutenant. He abused my cell door. There was no response. I was elsewhere, via Mind’s Eye.

Mind’s Eye makes some people panic. The lieutenant radioed medical to report an unresponsive offender. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center employees radioed back that they had nobody to send, so it didn’t matter. The lieutenant radioed Central Control to open my cell door. The lieutenant tapped me on my leg. That returned me to Terra, and I woke up.

Prisoner Express is part of Durland Alternatives Library. Prisoner Express makes Tara’s meditation packet and other alternative resources freely available to you. Utilize these alternative resources. They will train you in methods to control the radio waves of your mind. Meditation is one way. Guided visualizations are another. Enjoy alternative research into the alternative cosmos. Be thankful that you, like me, can learn to project Mind’s Eye, anywhere across Terra Cognizant. Then, demonstrate how thankful you are to Prisoner Express by using the alternative education they freely gave you.
