**In the Cave by James Schmidt**

For half a century I’ve been hiding in this cave from life, from love, though back then I was human. I was a wealthy woman with long red hair and many men were at my feet until that cold night.

I ran through the countryside with no shoes on, dress torn with blood stains. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it truly would break free. The lighting lit up the night sky; as the rains began to fall, soon I fell to the ground. The thunder rumbled about, that’s when my blue eyes found my new home.

The darkness became my friend, it gave me strength to carry on those long days. In the summer I’d look outside, the warm winds howled around the trees as the sun warmed the day. Though on rainy days I’d stand at the caves entrance and let the rains take me.

The fall would come and I’d look outside, there would be leaves of so many colors dancing in the winds. At times I’d twirl about as if dancing with a lost love. Many animals would come by, though the only one that came in was an old brown bear. Our eyes locked, and we roared at each other and he remained.

The winter came, the cold howlin’ winds would come in as did the snow, though the coldness was welcome as my body is always so warm. As the winter faded I looked to the entrance and the ice wall would be slowly melting. It was very soothing to touch.

The spring was the most intoxicating time of all. There I’d sit at the entrance to the cave. The grass began to grow; lady bugs would fly about. Even purplish flowers would grow and bee’s would come for a visit. Many deer would come by to eat the lush grass. Many would become a meal. The bear would awaken, stretch, yawn and leave, and I’d hope he’d return in the fall. By now my heart has been so lost from love, my skin crawls in the sunlight for it’s my only companion I have.

The summer has come once again. The pine trees held lush green needles. The crows have come, they caw at will as they walk about just outside my home. The winds have come though as I listen to them there’s no feeling of dancing only sleep comes to my eyes so I lay down just inside the darkness.

The sound of crushing leaves together comes in the winds, slowly I open my blue eyes. There’s a dark figure standing in the opening. by the aroma coming to my nose he’s a human. He stands there just looking into the darkness. I wonder if he’s going to be friend or foe.

He yells into the cave, his voice echoes. His soothing voice calls to me though I remain in the darkness. Thunder is heard from afar and he enters my home. He remains standing as my heart quickens; without thought I tackle him to the ground. With a slight struggle, we gaze into each other’s eyes. My teeth sink into his flesh with my fingernails.

One thing is certain as he awakens, I shall no longer look towards the cave’s entrance alone. The cave shall still remain our home and we’ll be werewolves in the night and perhaps love shall follow.
