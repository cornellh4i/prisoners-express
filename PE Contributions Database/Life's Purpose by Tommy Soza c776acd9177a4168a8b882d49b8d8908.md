**Life’s Purpose by Tommy Soza**

If life's purpose manifested before our birth would it be fair to conclude our own destiny has already been predetermined. Blame couldn’t be cast down. Praise and glory would not be shared outside our very own creation. In Psalms 139:16 it talks of we beginning as god seen us: “Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me we were written in your book before one of them came to be.” Before we were the small glimmers in our mommies and daddy’s eyes. Hard to believe are lives, everything and everyone in it had been foreseen. Foretold in some big book somewhere before where their own existence came to be.

Since time began for each one of us life has been an uphill battle. Life operating off of drive, determination and desire to achieve. As people in our upbringing time moves forward we discover a purpose. For some reason I can become a teacher to teach. For others it is becoming a doctor to heal the sick. It's only natural for us as individuals to be driven by purpose that it becomes our own lives.

As I sit here in my sby 4 vast and wide cell I reflect. Reflecting on my own life I wonder is it too late had I missed my purpose for existing had it come and gone. In my life ifny life had ever known purpose I would like to go back. Go back in time I want to tell you, I’m sorry I never got to know you.
