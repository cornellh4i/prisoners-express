The rescue story I’ve decided to share may come across a little different than others. You see, although I’m in prison now, things could have been much worse, had it not been for my big brother John. John wasn’t my real brother; he was the brother that found his way to me through the Big Brother program.

Growing up, I often chose to spend my time with the “bad apples” as my grandmother chose to call them. I was smoking both pot and cigarettes at the age of 14. I even drank a bit and stole some cars. I was very reckless and thoughtless of my actions.

My dad was a deadbeat whom I never knew growing up, and the last straw for my mom came when I was arrested at 14 for breaking into several summer homes in the Cape Cod town that I grew up in. It was then that She sought out the help of the Big Brother program of Cape Cod and the Islands.

With John’s help, I learned about giving back some of what I took from the houses I broke into. John was a cadet at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in Buzzards Bay, and he brought me there all the time to swim, play basketball, bowl, or just eat a really cool meal in the cafeteria with all the other cadets.

John taught me about caring for others and taking responsibility for my actions.

Although I’ve made more mistakes in my life, and I still wound up in prison, it’s not made me a mean person. My own kids are great kids who love me because of some of the principles John taught me long ago.

So when I said my story is a little different it’s because my big brother really rescued me from, well, myself. Without that rescue, I may not have even been here today, prison or not, to tell this story.
