**“Beaumont” by Curtis Colvin**

****I was raised in Southeast Texas. The area was called the Golden Triangle with Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange making the triangle. There are smaller towns which dot inside and out the tri-area, but Beaumont is the biggest.

I was born in Beaumont, raised in Port Neches, graduated in Bridge City, and married A Vidorian. While I was in high school, I went to a few concerts in the Beaumont Civic Center. That’s about all I knew of that city since it was so big. I even got lost leaving one time from a Heart concert, and all the drugs and alcohol didn’t help either. I was scared to drive in that “big city.”

After my marriage, I had to learn the “big city” because my wife worked downtown at the Texas State Optical Factory. This was the early 1980’s. Then I got a job as a maintenance man there, so we moved into Beaumont. After a year or two, Beaumont wasn’t that big bad city I was afraid of in my youth.

Then I got a job as an over the road truck river. I drove through the east coast states, about 26 of them. Now I know what big cities are! Skyscrapers, highways, traffic jams, people… Lots of people. New York City, the Bronx, Chicago--man, were they big.

But I’ve been in prison now going on 20 years, so Beaumont should have grown by now. I’m back to those scared thoughts of being lost once I get out of here. But hey, being lost in a big city is a whole lot better than being in here!
