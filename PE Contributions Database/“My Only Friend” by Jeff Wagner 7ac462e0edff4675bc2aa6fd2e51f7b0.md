**“My Only Friend” by Jeff Wagner** 

We walk. Thirty years ago, when we were in our mid-thirties, we each walked on a separate rail to see who could walk the furthest without losing our balance. We are too old for that now. Nowadays, we just walk the flat between the rails, we have learned to be more careful. The shadows lurk.

The shadows are up ahead, always just beyond the fog-line. We can see them when we walk. The voices are usually in a hush, a whisper, and when the fog begins to fade, they retreat; but we can hear them in the woods. They laugh. We have always known they were watching us. We can not return the other way. Time only moves in one direction; straight ahead, where the shadows lurk.

Our shoes wore out long ago, but the calluses have re-soled our feet. The rocks don’t hurt us anymore; so we trudge forward and pretend that we do not see the shadows. Day and night we walk.

Sometimes, when it’s too hot in the middle of the day, we stop and rest by the shade of the trees. Sometimes, when the twilight hour lulls us, we stop to sleep. We hide in the bushes, but sleep is sometimes hard to find. Shadows, whispers, and eyes move in the night. They know that we are there. So far, they have not harmed us; but they never leave us alone.

Any icy finger sometimes touches my spine; and when, wide-eyed, I look around pretending to be asleep, I can hear the laughter. We know that faded giggle. It has followed us, “Look! There’s another one,” it whispers; and without turning my head, I can see the peripheral shadow move. Sometimes we get scared.

I’ve peed in these pants so many times it doesn’t matter anymore. It bothered me at first, but it helps. It’s warm on colder days. It washes away in the rain. It dries in the sun. Nobody wants us around anyways, so what difference does it make? We quit hoping others would care when others quit hoping they could. Fear and loneliness create a numbness after a while. It’s like those shadows. They lurk, they whisper, and they watch; but only from a distance.They are usually up ahead, but they have flanked us; and sometimes, they sneak up from behind. We have to stick together. Maybe the only reason we have survived so long is because we look out for one another - you and me.

We found a box with a biscuit and some chicken in it on the backside of that town two days ago. That really helped to put a muffle on our belly sounds. Everytime we pass a creek, or a stream, or a river, I fill up that old plastic Pepsi bottle we found. We have to keep our eyes open and watch for something to use as covers. Winter will come soon. Things are starting to bother me.

I’ve been wondering and worrying. When will they get tired of watching? When will they stop laughing? When will they stop lurking? And if they do, what will it mean? What will happen then? You are my only friend; but your eyes have been looking tired. Your cheeks have sunken in. Your spirit whispers hollow.

Oh my friend! When they leave, are you going to leave as well? When we stop again to get water, I will look deep into the wetness. When the ripples settle, I will look into your eyes and ask you again.
