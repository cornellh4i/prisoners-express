Dearest Abby,

It feels just like yesterday that you was standing in the pouring rain, so torn in between. Pick the man or pick your mother? At the age of 18, you thought you knew everything. There wasn’t anyone who could tell you anything.

You didn’t know that by turning away from your mother’s cry’n pleas you would encounter very unhealthy things...abusive men, rapes, tricks, bad drug deals, among other things. All this would be covered up with drugs or alcohol, very strong, deadly addictions. Things that would have you making up excuses, while tearing you further away from reality.

As years past by, you were getting the same ole’ results, while your beauty was being taken from you. Many times your mother and grandma took you in, tried to clean you up and help you. Each time you looked like a broken, scared dog…so strung out.

You really thought you had control? What about you knowing everything? Yeah right! What about thinking that you look good? Drugs really lied to you!

These years can’t be given back that you’ve wasted. These years had gotten worse as your addiction continued after little breaks. Now where are you? Prison. You’ve been in prison a long time, even before you landed in a cell. You were in prison to yourself, the past. Your soul and spirit were so broken. You didn’t know who you were. Instead, you seeked men and tried to find your self-esteem and worth, and even tried to please and rescue them--not such a good idea. You didn’t know where to seek to find what you were looking for, and you pushed away the people that truly love and care about you.

Was prison a curse or a blessing? A blessing: it saved your life. We will never know where you would be if you never came to prison. Maybe death could have claimed you--it tried to before. You’re sober and getting to know yourself. Self-discovery has been an amazing journey. Your spirit is starting to heal, and now self-love is developing within. Beauty is regaining back. Each day you’re growing spiritually and repairing relationships. You’re going through an amazing transformation!

This little prayer has helped me: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference -Amen-

Now, my life is slowly coming together. The future is bright. I want you to remember the path you came from / the powerlessness you have. I use to be empty, now I am filled with the Holy Spirit.

Also, don’t ever stop loving and caring for yourself. It’s okay to stand out--in a good way. You don’t have to be a follower. You can be you. The true you that’s within.

Always	& Forever... Love, Abby
