**“Masks” by Charles M. Yonkings**

The word “person” comes from the Latin *persona* which means “mask.” Each and everyone of us have many masks that we wear, whether it’s to protect ourselves and hides our vulnerabilities from those around us, or to hide emotions, or even portray qualities that we wish we had. We can use masks to fit into different groups of society.

These masks change throughout the day as we move from scene to scene in this grand production we call life. We try to fulfill the roles that society has created. We have our professional masks for work. We have our Paternal or Maternal masks. We have our “street” masks and our “party” masks. Masks for all occasions.

As we move through the day, we hide behind these masks. They protect us from prying eyes of those around us. They create an image of strength when we feel weak. They show smiles when we are at our lowest. They may show tears when we seek sympathy.

We are all actors playing the part we think we must. In prisons, there are many masks to wear, and every role has a player. Some have many roles. The person they are, the person they wish they were, and the person they think others want them to be. There are predator masks, masks of prey, masks of loves, gangsters, and snitches, and all other characters imaginable. Both savory and unsavory, which is subjective. Right and wrong is in the eye of the beholder, especially in prison.

Though these masks we wear are used to hide ourselves from others, we also hide from ourselves. Most of us don’t have the slightest clue as to who we really are, and we are scared to find out. When you put someone alone by themselves for a while, a lot of things surface. Demons from our past come rushing at us in a whirlwind of what ifs and if onlys. The average person isn’t comfortable in their own skin so these masks are created to shield us from our own worst enemy: ourselves.

Nietzsche said it best: “When staring into the abyss, be careful fo rit may stare back into you.” So the next time you look in the mirror, ask yourself who is in the glass staring back. Is it me, or who I want to be, or who I was told to be?
