**The Sad Sentinel by Carl Branson**

For six centuries I've watched as some thirty generations enjoyed the valley below. In those earliest days everyone passed through my doors at least twice: first to be baptized, later to be eulogized. As my granite weathered and its sheen dulled, social change was inevitable due to conflicts like the Crusades and Inquisition; epidemics like the black plague; and most damaging, technological advances in the ability to distribute information like the printing press with the telegraph, phone, radio, television, computers and cell phones bringing us to the current day. Then there were the steam and internal combustion engines with their attendant improvements in farming equipment which eliminated the need for large families and draft horses. The population dwindled and eventually dispersed like autumn leaves in the wind.

The improved agricultural machines ended up cutting like a two-edged sword; harvests improved with each new "toy" until the natural fecundity of the valley was depleted and could not be easily restored. Now all I survey are fallow fields and vacant dwellings. My only visitors are foraging fauna and migrating fowl. If there is such a thing as a glorious afterlife as promised by the black-clad leaders, I have yet to experience it.
