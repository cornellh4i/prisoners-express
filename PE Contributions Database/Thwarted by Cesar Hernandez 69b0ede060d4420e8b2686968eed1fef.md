**Thwawrted by Cesar Hernandez**

I was thwarted by my wife from upgrading from a new twenty-two thousand car to a forty-seven thousand dollar car. My uncle had a two year old Infiniti G35. When he went on vacation for two weeks he let me borrow his G35. I did not realize that a G35 was such a great car. Previously I did know that Infinitis existed. What I did not know was that they are great cars to drive. I immediately went to the dealership to buy my very own G35.

When I bought my G35, I got the cheapest one that had a sunroof. My number one requirement for my cars is that they have a sunroof. What I did not know at the time was that the model for next year would be completely redesigned. I should have waited a couple of months for the new model.

I had my G35 a few months when the new model started arriving at the dealership. My wife and I were out for a drive near the Infiniti dealership. On a spur of the moment decision I pulled into the dealership. This pretty sales girl comes out. I ask about the M45. We go for a test drive. My wife is in the back seat while the sales lady tells me all about the M45. This car has everything. Leather interior, navigation system, sunroof, radio hard drive, back-up camera, and the headlights swivel. This car has the Technology Package and only costs forty seven thousand dollars. The very basic model M45 costs thirty thousand. At the end of our test drive we get back and Iâ€™m just about ready to sign the paperwork.

Before I can even get my credit checked to buy the M45 with Technology Package my wife puts her foot down. She basically drags me out of the dealership back to my G35. I am absolutely certain that if my wife had not been there that day, she would not have thwarted me from upgrading from a G35 to an M45.
