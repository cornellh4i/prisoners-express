**Gratitude by Dillon Gresham**

In the midst of life everyone is bound to gain life experience. The only way for these experiences to be of any meaning and not a waste of time is to learn from them, and to try to find something out of each to be thankful for. Even the toughest lessons you must be thankful for. They show you things about yourself you may or may not have known. You learn what you can and cannot do through experiences. I call this “making lemonade.” It means finding the positive in every situation, and learning to be thankful.

In July 2014, I was picked up in Marion County Alabama for a warrant out of Marion County Florida for charges of first-degree premeditated murder and grand theft auto. When I was first arrested I was scared; I thought I’d lost my life. To this day I am still waiting my day in trial (which I’m hoping will be July 5th 2017). From day one the prosecutor has chosen to seek the death penalty. While I do admit that I am far from perfect, and that I’ve done a lot wrong in life, since day one, I have declared innocence in what I have been accused of.

It took a long time before my eyes opened up to show me how this detour saved my life, rather than take my life. When I was free I had an addiction with making, selling, and using methamphetamines. I was always paranoid; I was aggressive and I took to getting my adrenaline by robbing people, stealing cars, and arguing. I always carried a weapon, whether it was a glock, revolver, or shotgun. I had the mindset that nobody would catch me without protection. As you can see, from what I’ve told you, I was a disaster waiting to happen. Now add in the factor that I was popular because I was high and kept people around me high, and that I was an attractive twenty-six-year-old man.

From what everyone knew of me, they all thought I was guilty. The description of the crime describes a scene that anyone who knew me agreed sounded like something they thought I would do. But only people who were around me on the date of the incident and following the incident know the truth. I’d even given arresting officers reason to suspect me by admitting to not only knowing my victim, but also robbing him around the time he supposedly died.

It wasn’t until later when my case progressed that I realized the good in my case. Five witnesses came forward with knowledge proving my innocence, and my attorneys built a case that proved I had nothing to do with the murder, and a medical examiner who did the immediate autopsy ruled me out. The cause of death, timing, and everything with the case helped me. I won’t go into detail because the case is ongoing.

Knowing what I know now, I am no longer scared. I’m just waiting for my day in court. Since I’ve been locked up I’ve lost the majority of my friends who I thought were my ride-or-dies. I’ve lost the majority of my family that I barely knew anyway, and I lost the girlfriend who was always whispering “forever” to me. All these people eventually disappeared from my life. The only person I’ve got left now is my grandmother who is slowly dying of brain cancer. She lives a couple counties away from the jail, so she can drive to visit through a program called Securus. So even though Grandma is far away and dying of cancer, she faithfully visits me for thirty minutes every night at seven.

Out of sight, out of mind. That’s what happened. Everyone I knew saw my charge, not my case. They figured me as a ‘dead weight’ or a loose end,’ which technically I am right now. Nobody saw me coming out of this alive. The truth will prove them wrong. I don’t mind that they left me anymore. I’ve had a long three years to find the positive. I’m clean, no drugs, back to normal, no paranoia, no longer aggressive, and I’ve found peace. All the people who deserted me were no good for me anyway. They would forever remind me of the ‘old me’---they were users and if I had kept in touch, I wouldn’t be able to get out and not get high. It’s just how it is.

So now I’m thankful that they are all gone. I’m thankful I’ve got this peace; I’m happy I’ve matured. Looking at what I’m fighting showed me where my life was heading. I’m thankful I was given the chance to see ahead. I feel like I was given a second chance. This, I plan to use wisely. I pray my grandma is alive when I get out, because she’s all I’ve got right now, but I’m prepared either way to make something better for my life.

I describe my feelings for this situation as gratitude. I took all the lemons, and made some ice-cold lemonade.
