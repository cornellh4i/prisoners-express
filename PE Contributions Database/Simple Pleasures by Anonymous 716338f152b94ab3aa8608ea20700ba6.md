**"Simple Pleasures" by Anonymous**

We live in a fast-paced society that calls for us to keep up. We're constantly changing the way we live and how we get around. Talking on the phone is a fascinating thing nowadays. You can be in the middle of a gun fight and get a phone call. This is the age of technology. Organizers fit in your hand; computers are the size of notebooks. When was the last time your brain did some math problems or checked a blueprint to make sure the specs were right? Better yet, when was the last time you heard the sounds of nature? Sometimes we take life for granted and don't realize what we've got until we lose it. To be able to see, walk, talk, and to feel the morning sun on your face...these are simple pleasures we sometimes take for granted. There are those among us that live a difficult life without being able to see, walk or talk. We even take freedom for granted. I should know about that one. I give my freedom up for nothing, now I'm thirteen years of a twenty-five year sentence. But we're talking about simple pleasures here. I wonder if all the technology has made our lives easier. Because in here things are basic. You have to put in some work to get some results. You have to maintain your health in order to handle any given duty. The next time you're with your wife or husband give them a hug and hold them for a while because that is a simple pleasure. And one that should be greatly appreciated by the one you love.
