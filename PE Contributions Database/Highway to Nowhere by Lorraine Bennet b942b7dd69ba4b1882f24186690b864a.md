**Highway to Nowhere by Lorraine Bennet**

On the highway to nowhere

I stand on a road,

That I really donâ€™t know where-

With this heavy load

I carry with me,

To every play I go-

The mountains, I see.

Every race; win, place, show.

The mountains seem,

So very far away,

With its crystal stream,

Under fluffy clouds sky-

From blue skies,

To oceans blue,

Their moisturized lies,

Cowering over you-

Like the way I did,

Standing over you,

In your pool of blood,

Swimming in death,

Taking your last breath,

That I gave for you-

Now, my mountains are concrete,

My clouds are stainless steel razor wire.

The rain drops that fall,

Are tears from clouds in my eyes-

The blue is no longer sky,

The past now always with me,

And the memory of you,

Never stops looking back.
