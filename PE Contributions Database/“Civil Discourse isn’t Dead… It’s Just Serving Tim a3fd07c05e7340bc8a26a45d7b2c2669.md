**“Civil Discourse isn’t Dead… It’s Just Serving Time” by Matt Ellinston**

With this year being an election year, it seems like it’s almost impossible nowadays to be able to turn on a TV or radio without hearing words that divide a nation. Hell, well-meaning comments seem to spark contentious debates and heated spats full of personal insults and animosity. Sometimes, it’s easy to wonder if civil discourse isn’t truly dead.

Prison is supposed to have rules about stuff like this. You don’t talk to people about politics, religion, or race unless you want to fight, the old-timers will tell you. Like most rules in prison, I’ve learned, everyone seems to break these. What truly surprises me is not merely the lack of physical altercations that result from this (though, undoubtedly, people do fight over lesser things), but also how often these kinds of conversations can help some see the similarities between themselves and others -- people who find common ground in their values and beliefs, even though they look different at first glance.

I’m reminded of a specific conversation I had with a person several months ago that turned out way differently than I thought it would. We’re not only from very different backgrounds (he’s a middle-aged, working class, white guy, and I’m a black, 29 year old college kid raised in the ‘hood), but our views on policy are markedly different. We’re watching the news one morning when a story comes on about the impeachment of President Trump. Now, I’m not gonna tell you my views because they’re not important to the story, but needless to say I was very adamant about putting them out there on this particular day. Maybe it was the coffee flowing through both of us, I don’t know, but me and this guy get into a super heated argument about this mess. One person starts to question the other’s ability to perform basic cognitive function, the other seems ready to dismiss this man as anything but one. It’s almost a knock-down, drag-out bout of verbal fisticuffs, and at one point even seems like it’ll devolve into a physical one as well.

Suddenly, in the midst of this exchange, this guy says something that makes me stop and regroup. I realize that one of the points we’ve been arguing on for like 20 minutes is something we actually both strongly agree on. When I point this out to him, he seems as surprised as I am -- the storm quickly abates. We go from there to a parallel conversation on everything from our shared sense of right and wrong to what personal responsibility means to each of us (turns out, we had a similar outlook on that, too).

In the end, we came away from this episode having gained a sense of respect for each other. Maybe our politics are different, but maybe that also doesn’t mean so much. My advice for all of you, locked up or not, next time you wind up in a similar situation: keep your eyes peeled for the things you share instead of the things you don’t. My guess is you’ll be surprised at what you see. I know I was.
