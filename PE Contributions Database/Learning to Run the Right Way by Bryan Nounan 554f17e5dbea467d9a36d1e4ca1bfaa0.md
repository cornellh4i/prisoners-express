**Learning to Run the Right Way by Bryan Nounan**

I love running, and I always have. Technically, I guess that’s not entirely true. I used to hate physically running. I could never figure out what motivated people to LIKE suffering through oxygen deprivation, hurting legs, shin splints, Achilles heels, and the numerous other common runner injuries. Haven’t these people heard of cars, bicycles, or taxis?! Secretly, I suppose I admired their tenacity, grit, and determination, but I preferred … well, more comfortable and quicker means of travel.

Loving to physically run has only recently become, in the last eight years or so, a pleasure for me. Occasional injuries aside, I now find the freedom of running mentally stimulating and physically rejuvenating. I might be physically exhausted after a run, but the mental energy I feel … wow! I get why people like this crazy activity. I just wish I had learned to appreciate running when I was younger.

I did my share of running as a younger fella, though. It just wasn’t the one-leg-in-front-of-the-other kind. I’ve been a life-long conflict avoider, and “cut and run” was my go-to. It started, I suppose, as a child when my parents’ arguments and fights used to get too intense. Voices getting too loud? Time to go. A hike in the woods for a couple of hours will do the job. If it’s raining, getting lost in a Charles Dickens book, curled up in a remote corner of the house for a few hours will do. As long as I’m not HERE, where life sucks right now.

When I was old enough, I became a long-distance runner, so to speak. A few states of separation will do from the family drama, thank you very much. The only problem is that I’m human too, so conflict followed me. It’s an inevitable part of life, I discovered. It also has surprising benefits for strengthening and deepening relationships, if it’s done right. I wish I knew this stuff before I harmed a marriage and other relationships by running from the tough stuff.

Running from conflict can take many forms, but other than avoidance, my go-to move was time-tried passive aggressiveness. I learned to speak fluent sarcasm, and I walled people off with a snide remark or backhanded comment. Oh, I’d often couch my sarcasm in humor to soften the blow, but I didn’t mind cutting someone off at the knees when I felt it was needed. The mental gymnastics kept me on my toes. It also kept people from getting too close.

Nearly a dozen years in prison now, I’ve discovered that it helps to have people in your life who truly care about you. That requires treating people with respect and dignity. It also means leaning into conflict as a way of saying, “You are worth the fight.” Prison has humbled me enough to be okay with being wrong sometimes and to be gracious when I am right. It’s also helped me to realize what is worth fighting for in the first place and to not sweat the small stuff.

Today, I know that confronting conflict can be healing. Avoiding conflict says, “You’re not worth it.” Addressing conflict in healthy ways affirms the other’s value. It says that their story, their experience, and their opinions matter. As Stephen Covey famously said, “seek first to understand, then to be understood.” Others first may not work in a race, but it’s a darn good policy for relationships.

These life lessons haven’t driven me to run towards conflict. I’m not crazy, after all. But they have conditioned me to handle the stress of conflict better, to value relationships more, and to live my life with more confidence and humility. Winning is not everything, but running well … that’s what really counts in the end.
