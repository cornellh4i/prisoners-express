**Tricky Business by Jeremy Brown**

Oooh this is a tasty topic, a five course meal I should say. One of the trickiest businesses I’ve run was the drug trade. Or simply put selling drugs. You end up dealing with all sorts of classes of personalities and characters. It truly was an exciting prospect at first, you know the fast money, girls, and the natural high one gets after a successful deal. Of course the first outer level is very superficial. The darker side comes later yet is not seen by one’s associates. The times you are on the run, sometimes from your own self, sometimes from nothing at all but a phantom of your very own making. In this dark world you cannot trust anyone not even your own self. It is a world of deception, mistrust, exploitation and dirty deeds. People you sell to will do anything for their next high. Degrading themselves lower than Ants. At least Ants are found in King;s Palaces. When deals go bad or money is owed the voracious hounds of hell come forth biting and gnashing of teeth and thing but blood is found dripping on the edges of your reality. There are good times although short lived when the money comes rolling in you feel like you’re on top for a while until you aren’t and the plunge and descent hits you so fast and hard you never have seen it coming. The problem at hand is when you make money fast, you do not appreciate it, especially of an illegal form. It slips away thousands gone in a day, spent on Parties, Alcohol, Strippers, more Drugs. Alluring? Yes at first but once you’ve seen the full circle of it the realization of complete and utter frivolous nonsense that it sets in. Thus the veil being lifted it is delightful to live. Honestly, Soberly, and more Godly. Yet the darkness never leaves you. The people who shitted on you (not literally lol) never leaves you either.
