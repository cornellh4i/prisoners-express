**“Man for Hire” by Corey Higgins**

It’s funny how things work out in life. I’m now walking in a hot, damned place with no water. They were so scared of my biting or spitting that they’ve put on me this face lock connected to my leg chains. If I make it out of this alive, I’ll have to get this shit off of my face. Plus, my carrying my fellow inmate is going to already take a lot out of me since he got knocked out. If not for honoring my damn word, I would use him as a shield and be on my way, but no, now I am aiming one of the guard’s shotgun at him, all while carrying Steve on my shoulders. Let’s not forget my face is chained in some kind of mask while being in no man’s land. Just my kind of luck…

Well, being locked up for just doing what you’re good at should be a crime in itself, though stealing is looked down upon as a low-life crime. I’m one of the most respected thief there has ever been. Though I steal, I only take from the rice, or people who you could say don’t deserve it in the first place. Now I know what you’re thinking: what gives me the right to say who deserves what? Well, you do. You’re the ones that come to me to hire my abilities, or as I like to call it, my gift. Most of the time, I take things that people had taken already from them, though if it be a person whose background says “stop this piece of shit” or “it’s time for a lesson in honor,” then off to the games.

So here I stand, shotgun in hand and fellow inmate Steve on my shoulder. I can’t allow myself to be sent to prison in no man’s land for taking a job that the government hired me to do. The job was to be an easy one, or so that’s how the guy in the suit said. Now, as it stands, it’s not so easy looking at these four guards who look pretty beat up. Of course, they want to shoot me where I stand, but I have a shotgun and my fellow inmate is somewhat of a high rank thug who would be the first job I’ve taken to steal a live human being without their knowing it. Guess all that shit they said about his being a tough guy is bull shit, or he wouldn’t have gotten knocked out by a low rank guard

Now I’ve got to get all these dumbfound wanna-be cops to rop their guns, and then get this face shit off. Forget about the chopper since it’s still not here. I’m not only going to steal one inmate; I’m going to steal all the inmates on the bus. Should be funny to see the government’s idea on this one though they never said I would be really charged for all my thefts. Of course, Plan B has video of their hiring me, and once I drop all these inmates off along with their thug, I’ll make sure to let the world know why I left four prison guards to find their way back without water and food.

And they call me the bad guy. No, I’m just a man for hire.
