**House by D.W. Johnston**

You see these old buildings (churches, houses, barns, etc…) all over. When I pass one I wonder about its story. Not long before I left California, I was living in the desert out past Barstow, along the Mojave. A strip of sand that some crazy person ages ago named “River.” One day cresting a dune on my dirtbike I nearly rode off the roof of an old stone house. Not surprising since there are all sorts of things buried in the dunes out there. An abandoned movie set, classic cars perfectly preserved. A spanish galleon full of pearls. Or so the stories say. The house was mostly full of sand so I couldn’t get inside, but it makes you wonder about who lived there. What would motivate someone to try and make a life in such a place? Drag all that crap out there and start stacking stone on stone ‘till they had a house. Maybe it was different then. Maybe the river actually flowed by. When I was young the river had some water in it year round, though barely a trickle once it passed Apple Valley. The alfalfa and ostriches they used to grow didn’t use as much water as all the housing tracts do now. Thinking of that house I’m amazed how quickly nature will take back what’s her’s if allowed to. Maybe one day after we’re all gone the river will wash away what’s left of that house, and its story will end.
