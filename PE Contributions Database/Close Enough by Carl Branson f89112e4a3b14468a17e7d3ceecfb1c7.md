**Close Enough by Carl Branson**

No doubt there are as many concepts, or definitions, of what constitutes “a close call” as there are people on this planet. Three significant “close calls” in my life involve the medical community.

The first revolves around the near miraculous birth of my youngest daughter. Unbeknownst to us, my wife, Pam, was about four weeks post-conception when abdominal radiology exams were performed relating to gastro-intestinal problems. Medical staff failed to even question the possibility of pregnancy let alone perform a verification test. Subsequent investigation revealed that due to faculty equipment and an abnormally high number of exposures due to inconclusive results, Pam was subjected to gamma radiation in quantities that should have been lethal to the developing zygote. After multiple second opinions, we concluded that termination was the wise course of action. To our surprise, the universally recommended abortionist provided the first glimmer of hope on the dark horizon. After another eight weeks of emotional uncertainty, an amniocentesis and sonogram indicated that the fetus appeared to be developing normally. My daughter celebrated birthday 36 this past July.

The second also involves my wife Pam. She was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer about three months after our son was born. Because the cancer could metastasize elsewhere, I would palpate every square millimeter of Pam’s body at least once per month. During one of these exams I discovered a lump about the size of a BB on the right side of her neck. As doctor’s appointments were scheduled about one week apart, the lump grew to pea size, then walnut, and by the time the MRI was performed about 5 weeks after its initial discovery it was the size and shape of a bartlett pear. The MRI revealed that the tumor was entangled in Pam’s carotid artery. The ENT surgeon (ear, nose, throat) was reluctant to attempt removal because the best-case estimate of surviving the surgery was about 25% with a “more realistic” range of 10-15%. After we executed dozens of liability waivers and other legal documents, surgery was scheduled. The doctor estimated about 2 hours for the surgery. Having spent less than an hour in the waiting room, the doctor entered. But for the smile on his fact that had his lips touching at the back of his head, I would have died on the spot. In an excited, awestruck voice he explained how the tumor basically popped out en masse once the surrounding muscle was opened-- something he had never experienced or read about before. We had Pam another 2 years before the cancer metastasized in her abdomen and was undetected by x-ray, cat-scan, MRI or other non-invasive testing.

The third, and most recent, was up close and personal. On December 1, 2018 I suffered what the cardiologist called a near fatal heart attack. They kept me in a medically induced coma for 10 days on life support; so I believe the cardiologists “near fatal” classification. Now the proud owner of 5 stents, a pacemaker, and a regimen of 8 daily meds, I should have at least a few remaining good years above ground.
