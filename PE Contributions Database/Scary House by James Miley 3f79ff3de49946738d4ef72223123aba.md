**Scary House by James Miley**

It started off as a dare.

The place gave me the chills. My friends were going on about ghosts and the mass murder that took place behind those stone walls nearly 200 years ago…

The bottle of liquor was passed to me a second time, and then a third. The burst of courage it seemed to give them passed my heart and soul completely by.

The car was soon left behind as we walked along the gravel encrusted road. The sun was all but gone. Shadows surrounded us.

Kenneth was the oldest of the four of us. He was in the tenth grade, but destined to repeat it because he was failing three subjects. Adam, Mike and I were all eighth graders, so Kenneth was sort of our default leader. He had a cool car, he lived close by and he was kind of popular. “If anybody pisses themself, you’ll have to walk home,” Kenneth said and laughed while we walked, huddled together.

“Should we knock?” Mike asked as we stood in front of the formidable wooden door.

The place was deathly quiet. Kenneth, eager to prove how brave he was, reached out and rapped three quick times on the door. The sound echoed into the house, and we listened with held breath. No answer came. “Thank god,” I said as my heart skipped and flipped.

“Looks like no one’s home,” Adam whispered.

Just then, the door cracked open. The darkness that lay inside that house seemed alive. The door was slowly being opened. No light, only darkness. And it moved. Then the darkness began to whisper… “Come in.”

I was backing away even as Kenneth was moving forward. Then Adam was taking a step toward the sound of the darkness. “Come on in,” the house coaxed… the dark became darker somehow. Then Mike was moving as if in a trance.

“Guys, stop!” I looked at the door as it slowly revealed more and more of the darkness that laid within its threshold.

I pulled at my friends’ clothing, I tore Adam’s shirt. Kenneth was entering the house, crossing into the void. The darkness seemed to gain pleasure from him. “STOP KENNETH! Don’t go in there!” I yelled while holding Adam. Then he was gone. Mike followed him in. I tried to hold Adam, but he was stronger than me and impatient to go.

I ran, my heart exploding. The car was where the police found me the next morning. Apparently I called them.

I never went back to that house again. I have yet to make any new friends. The mental ward is brightly lit. The darkness scares me.
