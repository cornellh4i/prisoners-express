“Emerging From the Fog” by Robert Downs

My fog was my addictions to weed, coke, pills, and meth. There, it’s out in the open; I admitted it. My emergence from my personally tailored fog was forced upon me and I fought it with tooth and nail. My first night in county jail was a blur of weed and Percocets. Every night I was desperately searching for something, anything, to quiet my many demons and their assiduous forms of torture. I didn’t find anything. I was helpless as my preponderant demons laid siege upon my benighted psyche, my fragile mind. I was forced to welcome with open minds the very things I’ve been running from since I was 15.

As I sit in this prison cell, this 7 foot by 9 foot cage, writing the first draft of what you are reading now, I’ve come to realize many things. The one that stands tall above others is none other than my beautiful baby girl being born; emerging from my fog is the best thing that’s happened to me. The saying “I wasn’t arrested, I was rescued” holds true for me. As I sit back and think about the downwards spiral I was on, I honestly believe that my emergence saved my life. The only downside to this whole ordeal is, in living life I was living; I used, stole and hurt everyone that would let me close enough to do so. That is exactly why I’m doing this time alone. In my old life, I didn’t just burn my bridges, I used high explosives.

My senses were dulled for so long that it’s taken some time to get used to these sights, sounds and smells. It’s almost as if my damaged encephalon had to reset, had to reboot. I almost forgot what it was like to be sober. Now that I’ve begun to fully awaken, I’ll die before I go to that pathetic excuse of a life.

My demons are ever present and always pounding on the lowered portcullis of my psyche, eager to charge my mental defense and ensnare my benighted soul. I must be on guard constantly, which is nearly impossible and a moment of idleness can have dire consequences. I must always stay busy, stay focused, just so my failures as a son, brother, father and man, my shortcomings, words left unsaid; and my many should’ve, would’ve, could’ves (my demons) stay in the background, stay under my control. Sleep was once a relief  but it’s been infiltrated and now my demons are sabotaging my dreams and fueling my nightmares. This prison of razor wire, walls, locks, and doors; its guards with their invertebrate forms of oppression, and these mindless drones with their hate-filled eyes and fake laughs aren’t very hard to deal with; it’s almost bearable. All these things I can’t forget are what’s killing me slowly, my malady - my terminal illness.

My only true escape is my writing. Whether it be my journal, some poetry, or a piece of fiction I might be working on, when I’m engrossed in my writing I’m not in this 7 by 9 foot cage. With pen in hand, I’m free of this prison of hate, fear, racism, ignorance and oppression. I’m free of my many problems and my numerous issues. Once I turn my writer’s imagination on, I am truly alive. I’m free to slip into my very own world; free to lock the door, throw the bolt, draw the shades, and lose myself. I don’t have to worry about always having to hide my emotions or my kindness. I can truly relax and be me. If it were possible, I would buy a one way ticket leaving right now. I wouldn’t even pack.

I must now learn how to harness my demons and use them as fuel for my writing, fuel for my pen. Being locked in a room with one’s demons can either be dangerous or beneficial and in order to make it out of this gulag alive and somewhat sane I must learn to master my nemesis, my forever opponent. If by chance I can harness and then channel my nemesis into my writing so I can then create, not only fiction, but a voice so those going through the same thing will know they’re not alone, to be able to help someone with my vowels and consonants, will be well worth the despair and sorrow. To let someone know it’s okay to feel the way they’re feeling, to show them a way out, is worth the torment.

This is what I must master, what I must overcome. Now that I’ve started writing once again, started thinking once again, I’ll never stop creating, never stop sharpening my skill. I can’t afford to lose the high ground that I’ve conquered, the little bit of progress I’ve made. These are the things I must deal with since emerging from the fog.
