**by Clarence James Cummings**

Whenever fear strikes and the beating rhythmic pulse of the heart increases, a wave of emotions cascade, releasing anxiety and pheromones. This awakening, the instinct to defend or elude, is nature’s way of self-preservation. The sudden and unpleasantness of this emotional disturbance--fear--must be faced. As time passes and the commitment to overcoming fear through perseverance persists, anything is possible. There’s nothing impossible: the possible only takes longer. Starting from infancy into late adulthood, everyone experiences a range of emotions and events. Many of our events may be self-guided or guided by external stimuli. The core self is rational and honest. Whenever our sense of fear is awakened, another part of the human anatomy experiences change. One’s interpretation of that rational thought, fight or flight, guided by an event-fear, determines the outcome result. As we face fear, we build up that most primitive instinct of survival. “Only the strongest survive.”
