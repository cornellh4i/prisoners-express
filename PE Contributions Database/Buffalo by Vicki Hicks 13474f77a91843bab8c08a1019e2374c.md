**Buffalo by Vicki Hicks**

My boss was from Buffalo, New York and of course he is a Buffalo Bills fan. He was easy to buy gifts for anything with a Buffalo on it was perfect. A friend of his had a huge Buffalo head hanging in his house. So, as a joke, my boss said that would look good in my office. He never thought in a million years that his friend would give it to him. Have you ever been in a police station that has a huge buffalo head hanging prominently in the Chicago office? Well, if you ever go to Sebring, Florida you will see it. Oh wait, when he retired so did the buffalo head and now hangs in his house. His wife was flabbergasted when that thing showed up at the front door. By the way the thing is very real looking and not very attractive. That thing haunted the police station. When you went into the Chicago office it felt like the thing was looking down on you and if you moved his eyes followed you very creepy. When one of the city officials stopped by for the visit meeting he always threw his hat over the buffaloâ€™s eyes. I wonder if it follows my boss and his wife around the house. Creepy!
