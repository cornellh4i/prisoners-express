**Untitled by Short Story Jones**

Go back in time. Can you remember when our parents would take the cover off the fire hydrants and we kids would go out there and play in the water on hot summer days? Man, those were the good old days.

My name is Kate. The picture you see of me is when I was eight years old. I remember this day as if it were yesterday.

1996:

“Mom, can I have some ice cream? The ice cream truck is outside!” I yelled.

“Kate, you know you can’t have ice cream before your dinner,” my mom said.

“But mom, it’s super hot outside and I’m about to melt to death,” I pouted.

“Well Kate honey, stay inside under the AC and you won’t have to melt or die,” my mom snickered.

“Mom, that’s not fair. Everyone is outside today.”

“You mean little Bobby Johnson is out there.” Mom laughed.

“Mom that’s not funny, I don’t like him.” I lied.

“Mmhm, of course you don’t honey, just remember what your dad said, no boys until you’re 30.”

Back Outside:

“Hey Kate,”

“Hey Bobby”

“You didn’t get any ice cream?” asked Bobby

“No, my mom won’t give me sweets before dinner.”

“Hey, take the rest of my ice cream”

“No, I better not, but thanks anyway.” I said

Then Bobby says “Look, Mr. Jones is opening the fire hydrant, I’ve got to go put on my trunks.” And he took off running to his house, so I went back into my house to find something to get wet in.

“Kate, what are you doing in there honey?”

“Just looking for my bathing suit because Mr. Jones just opened the hydrant up.”

“Woa, woa, woa young lady, first off you didn’t ask me if you could play in the water.”

“Mom, pleeeeease, it’s so hot. I’m going to melt and die if I don’t get in the water, pleeeease mommy.” I whined and battered my baby blues at her.

“Girl, you are too much. Ok listen. First only for an hour because you have to come in and eat dinner when Dad gets home and second put on shorts and a T-shirt. We don’t want little Bobby Johnsone seeing that you’re starting to need a training bra”

“MA!”

“I’m just saying, honey.”

Outside again:

I got my sand pail, and I’m going to drown Bobby with it! Wait, what’s that he’s got? Not fair, he’s got a Bazooka Soaker.

“Bobby you better not shoot me with that thing.”

“Why not, you are going to drown me with that bucket of water, aren’t you?”

“No,” I lied, “Look behind you.” When he turned I ran to splash him but he turned back too fast and got me good with his bazooka soaker, and this went on for a whole hour. I had so much fun!

God, what good memories! Today I am Mrs. Bobby Johnson, I didn’t wait until I was thirty like dad said but twenty four!
