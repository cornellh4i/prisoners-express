***Oneiromancer* by Matthew Tomlinson**

You see the photo. You see the man in the robes. You see the robed man standing in the water, standing off of the 17th Street jetty in the morning mists of Galveston. The robed man is a priest of Oneiromancy (say it oh-nigh-roe-man-cee). Oneiromancy is divination by means of dreams. This priest could be giving gratuities for those dreamers who made the transition, but we don’t know yet.

What do they know? The dead know nothing. Prophet Samuel was called back from death by the Witch of En Dor at the request of King Saul. Necromancy exists from that bit of history. Samuel told King Saul that within 24 hours he, too, would be dead. The next day, King Saul was killed in battle. Therefore, the dead can accurately foretell the future. The frivolous doctrine that the dead know nothing is proven false, when “dead” means physically dead.

What do we know? Physical death is described as sleep, and Samuel, sleeping in his grave, knew that King Saul would die the next day. Necromancy is divination by means of consorting with the dead who apparently dream as they sleep in the grave. We know, also, that oneiromancy, divination by dreams during normal sleep, is real.

Now what do you know? Do you know whether last night’s mental images make you a dreamer, or an oneiromancer? You dreamed of rain and awoke to rain. So you’re a dreamer, nothing more. You may have also dreamed that you were walking in the rain and saw lightning strike the flagpole. If you were walking up the rainy sidewalk then notice lightning strike the flagpole, then take your new title, oneiromancer.

Take what you know, fledgling oneiromancer, and pursue it a step further. Was the premonition sent by someone? Did God or an angel warn you? Did Satan or a demon send the lightning? Beware and take care, oneiromancer, lest you falsely accuse supernatural entities. While you knew the lightning was coming, you don’t know who sent the lightning, the premonition, or why. If you falsely condemn a supernatural entity, then you tempt one or another to vindicate their dignity. There are many lightning bolts. Best not to run a flag up your lightning rod.

The priest of oneiromancy indeed could be offering gratuities, standing there in the morning mist. He could be grateful that you, fledgling oneiromancer, successfully transitioned without rushing headlong into condemnation--yet. But these are times of change, and the priest can alternatively be interceding for you. Beware and take care. The priest offers homage with a petition that you will learn to recognize where and when to expect the next lightning bolt.
