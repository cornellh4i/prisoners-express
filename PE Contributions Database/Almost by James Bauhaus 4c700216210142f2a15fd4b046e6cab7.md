**Almost by James Bauhaus**

The politicians are so proud of themselves to have mastered the difficult art of getting elected, but it’s nothing but simple psychology, propaganda, body language, grinning and winking. Hollywood actors learn these cheap tricks easily in expensive schools. The most difficult part, beyond getting the money, the trainers, the puppet-masters, etc., is simply mastering the art of lying like a psychopath, without giving oneself away as evolution intended. Politicians, like Jeb Bush, push the illusion of politician as a special vocation of special people by inanely trying to put the word “leadership” in his speeches as many times as possible, trying to make “leadership” into telling us “you need to elect me! Because I’m a leader! I founded a leadership school! That makes me the biggest leader of them all!” People smarter than him realize that leadership is an empty word, meaning nothing, made up *by* politician scalawags for politician scalawags.

The media knows this “almost” profession for the nonsense/propaganda that it is and, afraid of too many thinkers of the voting public snapping to this fact, help push the scam along by exclaiming hysterically, “this outsider, nobody, candidate has no political experience! Panic! No non-politician can run the country! Else disaster must ensue!”

Thoughtful people may realize that “political experience,” which is required before “leadership” can often comes from being a former prosecutor/judge. Following this logic, thinking people realize that this entire community is composed of mere, simple word smiths! Talk-artists! Their one major skill is the vocation of lexicography! The study of jargon! They have no skill or real understanding of science, math, physics, or other fields that use solid, objective fact. They instead are masters of creating doubt, using deceit, manufacturing emotion and chasing weak minds down dark corridors en masse, in pursuit of their own goals, not usually coinciding with the good of humanity or the commonwealth.

So, much as the inherited rich, the over-privileged classes and their media sycophants want to convince voters otherwise, the indisputable fact is that politician, leadership and wordsmith are all “almost” professions, not real professions. In fact, without the lapdog media propagandists’ foghorns constantly blasting the public mind, propping them up, the politician would be a non-profession. You want good governance, you have to base it on science and fact. Right now, more than ever, we have fake governance from smiling, lying chaplains, based on fear. It’s not even “almost governance,” it’s pure quackery, exactly as george orwell saw in 1948, when he wrote his predictive book, titled 1984.
