**“Hitch-Hiking Across America” by Jonathan Haynes**

It was June of 1977 and I had just graduated from high school. But maybe “graduated” is the wrong word, because I had just barely passed my final semester of classes. I was afflicted with a terrible case of senioritis and had an “FTW” and “FTS” attitude. I hadn’t attended classes in weeks before the end, and my grades were only just above the “F” level. However, with the diploma in my hand, I set off to see the world or at least much of it as my extended thumb would allow.

I took the bus from Carpentaria, California to Barstow, and parked my pack by the side of an on-ramp. In a couple of hours I had hitched a ride. In a couple of days, I was in Las Vegas, getting the “come on from the whores.” I camped out amidst the desert scrub brush.

The next ride I caught with an Army active-duty soldier. I rode with him all thee way from Nevada to Kentucky. I wound up on a tobacco farm for a week earning a little extra cash. Room, board, and $200 in cash. Not a bad haul. The tobacco farm was adjacent to a thoroughbred racehorse breeding operation. Every morning as I was jostled in the pickup truck on the way to the fields, I was treated to the sight of the lithe and muscular mares, geldings, and stallions.

I bounced around Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana, only to find myself sweating, sitting on the National Mall in Washington D.C. on a hot summer day.

The high point of my stay in D.C. was the national Air and Space Museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution. I visited mainly because I wanted to see the big, 10-foot long model of the Enterprise used in the Star Trek TV series for special effects shots. But what really stuck in my mind was the exhibition of Socialist Realist art put out by the Soviet Union to propagandize for their space program. Looking back on it, the imagery was indeed overblown and bombastic; but for a star-struck teenager, the pictures were the biggest turn-on I had ever seen.

To make a long story seem short, my backpack was stolen by a jerk in Elkhart, Indiana who drove off with it, deserting me in a roadside diner while I was using the men’s room. I worked at the First Federal Frank and Crust pizza place in Chicago for 4 months, then said to hell with it and caught the Greyhound back home.
