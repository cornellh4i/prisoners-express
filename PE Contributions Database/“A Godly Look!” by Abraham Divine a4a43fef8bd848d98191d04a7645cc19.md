**“A Godly Look!” by Abraham Divine**

One day long ago, God was looking for someone to bless. God looked here, looked there, looked everywhere. God just could not find anyone to bless. So God said, “I will just have to look at the blessings that I have already blessed them with.”

So God looked over here, then God looked over there. And God said “Aha, there they are, my beloved Abraham and his wife Tiffany, and their daughter Abreanna. They are lying in a hammock under my heaven, soaking up the sun.”

So God was pleased with the blessings that he has given to Abraham, Tiffany, and Abreanna.
