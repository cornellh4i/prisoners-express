**“Lost in Thought” by Robert Short**

As she sat looking out at the city that had always been her home, she wondered if leaving was what she needed. She just buried her parents who were killed when they were T-boned by a drunk driver as they were returning home from her high school graduation ceremony.

She had just been accepted to her desired college with a full scholarship, but it was out of state and her twin sister took the loss of their parents a lot harder than she did.

Her sister encouraged her to go ahead and go to school. That she could not waste this opportunity and it is what Mom and Dad would have wanted. But she was uncertain. And of course, the rest of the family said to go. Aunt Ethel said she would help look out for her sister. But Rosie worried that Angela would have too hard of a time taking care of the house they grew up in. But she still had a bit of time to figure it out. But she knew deep down that she had to go; after all, it was what Mom and Dad wanted for her.
