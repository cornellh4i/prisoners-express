**Dear Carol, by Cathleen Roth**

I know we haven’t talked in a while. Every time I talk to mom or dad I ask about you. I am so proud to call you my sister, even though you barely acknowledge my existence. I wish I had your life. You have a career, a car, a house and a cat. You even have a passport--something I will never have. The only cat I have is a feral one that roots through the trash and my house is a 6 x 9 concrete cell.

Sometimes, when I am particularly frustrated, I wish you would be arrested and spend a week or two in jail. I feel you have no idea what I live with on a daily basis and that you cannot begin to fathom the hell I live in. I know I put myself here, that I deserve to be here, but “here” is a place where things only get worse, never better.

You were always the good sister - daddy’s little girl. I was always jealous of that.

I’m sorry I wasn’t a better sister. Back in Cuba, when you were teased mercilessly, I should have stood up for you and told those kids to shut their faces. But I wanted so badly to be cool and hip and part of the in-crowd that I ignored what they were saying. I still remember some of their taunts.

There were the times that I stole from you and lied to you, but you didn’t tell mom and dad, just kept a better eye on your bank card and car keys.

You’re a beautiful person, inside and out. I wish I could be the kind of sister you would be proud to acknowledge.

I wish I could take back all the awful things I did; I wish you would talk to me and tell me how your day was, what your boss is like and what your boyfriend got you for your birthday. I wish you would give me your address and phone number so I can write you and talk to you.

Now I sit here rereading this, and although I miss you even more, I have this sudden inexplicable thought that I can’t seem to get rid of.

You are a selfish human being. I have been incarcerated now for over ten years. Isn’t that a long enough time for your little grudge party? I have lived in absolute hell for the past decade, and I still have another to go. There are times I refuse to leave my cell because I am afraid of what is happening outside. Do you know what it’s like to have no control of what happens to you? I have to ask permission to use the bathroom, the lights are always on and the noise would drive a saint to murder. I have to watch what I say because even a simple “hello” can be misconstrued and lead to violence. Literally, it happens. I live in a hell where a hug can lead to a sexual misconduct report, where farts can lead to violence and bloodshed (also literally), where there are no secrets and friendship is a joke and a waste of time. Do you know what it’s like to not have a single friend in the world? I have no one to turn to, no one to confide in. Phone calls home are expensive (not to mention recorded) and I make a whopping thirty cents an hour.

I wish I had your life. I wish we could trade for a day.

Your sister,

Cathy
