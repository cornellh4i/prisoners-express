**Arguments by Cesar Hernandez**

You've probably heard the phrase that you never know who your real friends are until trouble comes.

A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. Maybe you've wondered who among your friends will love you at all times, not just when there is peace and plenty. Have you ever stopped to consider whether you are that kind of friend? Are you a brother or sister who was born for adversity? Do you start or end arguments?

One of life's most difficult challenges is to be a stalwart for a hurting friend, particularly if their trial involves potential wrongdoing or error on their part. Sometimes we are quicker to judge and condemn than to be available to vicariously share a burden.

Take a moment to consider how you react to the adversities of your friends. Do you steer clear for a while until the situation settles? Do you cease relations altogether? Or do you put an arm around your struggling buddy and lend an ear or encouragement?

You'll never know what kind of real friend you are until their trouble comes.
