**“Ghost Train” by Jacob Ecker**

It’s strange and slightly unsettling but...I’ve been here before.

Walking down a semi-rugged train track surrounded by a colossal forest painted with every manner and species of flora known (and unknown) to man, the visage bursting with vibrant greenery coloring the landscape with its vitalic element.

The tracks I tread are old and married with dents and flecks of rust, the sky which hangs above, washed serene with pale blue and somewhere in the distance, peeking over the tips of the titanic trees, the face of the sun. Its quiet. Almost eerily so. There is a preternatural quality to the rust which has enveloped this almost picturesque vista. The only exception to the silence is the continuous droning hum, which I attribute to the high voltage telephone poles that run down both sides of the tracks. Where the hell am I?

The marijuana cigarette I smoked earlier has done its job in steeling my nerves and keeping me calm.

Quite admirably so…

I breathe in deeply and exhale slowly and look around me trying to figure out where I am and how I got here. I feel a tremor in the tracks and look behind me to so it: there is a train approaching but I don’t see or hear anything, and yet.. The almost indiscernible vibrations I feel are already noticeably intensifying, though subtle. Something is coming.

Still trying to get a bearing on my surroundings, I notice a light off in the distance. No. That’s not right, it’s...fog..a fog compromised of blinding pale light, tenuous, shifting and insubstantial, and yet… I am chilled to the bone by its very presence.

The amorphous fog begins to slowly expand, drifting closer to me as it it can sense me, and suddenly, I’m quite sure it does sense me!

I’m thoroughly convinced this cloud retains a modified level of primal intelligence as it slowly drifts toward me. Hell, it could be omniscient for all I know, and it suddenly occurs to me that I must flee and escape it!

But, as I turn to run in the opposite direction, I see another equally queer and terrific sight.

It is a train... and yet... it is not a train.

I place its origin of manufacturing somewhere in the early 1950s, if the model is of any indication, with its shovel headed engine billowing out trails of smoke from the distended pipes that repose upon its gargantuan head. This in itself is baffling, but there are two other startling distinctions I observe in the monolith that are shocking. The first is that as this old relic is barreling down the track towards me, it is making absolutely no noise; no cute “choo-choo” from the horn, no chugging from the wheels as it hastily speeds its way down the rails like a metallic bat out of Hell. Just this persistent, if not ominous, silence which seems to persuade the immediate area instilling me with a gnawing sense of dread that goes bone deep.

My second observation of this steel wraith turn my insides to ice.

This train, which looks nothing short of solid wavers in and out of existence, shimmering from a substantial form to something...less. Translucent and wan, though nothing less than threatening or deadly.

I know I should run, but I am rooted to the spot, paralyzed and transived with complete shock and awe that are absolutely planetary in their proportions. But the revelation that suddenly strikes me is much more profound, as I realize that what I am looking at defies the “fabrication” from which it originated with its actual existence.

It is a ghost train and it's coming to take me away. I suddenly remembered the fog which I initially endeavoured to flee, and turn to discover that it has already advanced considerably, making any further attempts a vain and doomed failure.

I can do nothing but wait for the end to occur as I am caught between two titans of terror with nowhere to run or hide.

The panic and apprehension that are feit are inexplicable as I wonder if the demise will be painful and filled with unbearable agony, or if my death will be swift and painless.

And then, quite abruptly, right before I am mowed down by the colossal ghost train , or spirited away by the mysterious fog. I am rudely awoken by my friend.

“Dude, wake up,” he said. “Time to leave...by the way, you look so stoned, Molly’s gonna know you are high.”

I smile a quaint smile as he turns to leave, getting up and following after him.

Pausing momentarily, I give the train tracks surrounded by the forest one more speculative glance, shake my head, then catch up to my firend.

Some things are better off alone.
