**Keeping Calm by Delvin Diles**

Sometimes I practice diaphragmatic breathing while mindfully monitoring consciousness in the focus of respiration and existence, periodically checking my pulse rate and watch until it slows to 65, 63 beats per minute. If I cultivate calmness, the uncertainty, the imminent danger of possible violence of the outside world, is surmountable.
