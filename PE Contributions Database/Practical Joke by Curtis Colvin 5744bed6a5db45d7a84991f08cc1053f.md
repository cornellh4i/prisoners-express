**"Practical Joke" by Curtis Colvin**

I remember a few practical jokes I had pulled on my parents in the past. They seemed funny and a cool thing to do...at the time.

My mother was lying in bed, watching television. I went in there and sat beside her, just talking. I asked her some questions about the show she was watching to get her attention away from me as I snuck one of her cigarettes out of the pack and put a cigarette bang into the end of it. I snuck it back into the pack and took off. I waited outside for bedroom door for about 30 minutes. Then I lit it up. For sometime the cigarette bangs doesn’t work.

About an hour later while I was in my bedroom, I heard a loud “pop” and a scream from my mom. I ran into her room, saw the look on her face, and started laughing really hard. Smoke was coming out, and there was tobacco all over her and the bed.

She threw the cigarette across the room. She was very mad, but I couldn’t stop laughing.

“Just wait until your dad gets home!” she said. I got a punished, but it was worth it!

Another time, when I was about fifteen years old, my dad and mom were sleeping late, and it was April 1st, April Fools Day. I decided to do something funny. I went up to their bedroom door and started badning and yelling, “FIRE! FIRE… There is a fire in the kitchen!” My father came running out in his old men boxers toward the kitchen. When he got there, and there was no fire I yelled, “April Fools!” He got so mad for he was a coonass, his last name was Boudreaux (step dad). He chased me out of the front door and onto the front yard, still in his boxers trying to get me. At first I laughed but stopped when the chase started. Needless to say, I got punished again. The wonderful life of practical jokes, until they’re pulled on me!
