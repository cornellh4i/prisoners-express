**“Honor” by Steven Lee Adkins, Jr.**

****Finally, after all these years, this is the closest I’ve ever been to it. Somewhere in these mountains, inside a caved-in labyrinth of tunnels and underground rooms, is the sword hand of the ancient war god named Tyr. Tears of joy freeze upon my face, snaking their way into my beard.

Suffering nature’s elements in the most isolated terrain, I wipe my eyes and think of all the men I killed and sacrifices I made. All the information gathered from locals and the rumors I followed to dangerous locations brought me to nothing. What seemed perpetual disappointments now have an ending after all. Contacting me now is a colleague, a geologist and historian.

She shares a fragile slab of stone with me that she’d purchased. It has runes carved on it. Every location described upon the stone slab has been verified by my travels. I can feel it in my heart that this it--really it this time. Now that I’m this close, I laugh at myself because I haven’t even thought about what I’ll do with it. Whatever happens, the process needs to be handled with the utmost love and respect. Ancient pagan war god deserves such honor.

He was the leader of the Asgard and not only sacrificed his sword hand, a most precious limb as a god of war, but simultaneously and selflessly sacrificed his position for the good of the whole. He strode to his destiny with his head high, instead of ordering someone else to do what needed to be done.

He was the only god not frightened by the Fenris Wolf, the monstrous son the god Loki. Over the centuries, tens of thousands of warriors carved the rune, Tyr’s rune, into their weapons. The families of these warriors prayed to Tyr and made sacrifices to him, as did the warriors themselves.

It may be years before I am able to find and dig through the rubble. And possibly more years to find the correct tunnel and correct room. Possibly just to be killed by the deadly and most powerful Fenris Wolf, the beast who sensed a trap as the gods challenged him to test his strength against bindings.

The first time, the monster broke free. The third time, Fenris grew suspicious and said the only way he’d test his strength for a third time was if one of the gods would place their hand in his mouth. None stepped forward except Tyr, the only one who was fearless and willing to sacrifice so much to protect Asgard. None other than Tyr would feed the Fenris Wolf either.

Personally, I believe that after the Fenris Wolf was imprisoned, he regurgitated the hand of the mighty war god to look at and comfort himself, knowing the gods didn’t walk away from and encounter him unscathed. I admire it in the dark and damp depths of his confinements as one would admire a hard earned trophy. I, however, have no fantasies about the guns and knives I carry, being able to kill or even ward off the Fenris Wolf. I bear these weapons to protect myself from predators of the wilderness and to kill anyone who may try to kill me or try to stop me.

I will leave the wolf bound and out of respect, I’ll leave Tyr’s hand there. I worry officials may try to claim it and place it in a museum to feed their green driven by monetary goals and reputation. If I knew how to return it to Tyr, that seems most appropriate. Maybe, as I continue my journey, a way to achieve this may reveal itself. But for now, with felicity, I’ll begin to search these beautiful mountains, the final location to which the stone slab has directed me.
