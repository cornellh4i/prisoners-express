**No Big City for Me by Shaun Blake**

I’m from Utah, so the biggest “city” is Salt Lake City. But considering I lived the first six years of my life in towns with populations less than *three hundred*, Salt Lake is huge. Now that I’m forty-eight years old, the biggest city I’ve ever lived in is Boise, Idaho. At the time - 1972-1973 - I believe it was less than 100,000 population.

When I was fourteen years old our family took a vacation to Los Angeles. We spent time at Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and Long Beach, playing in the Pacific Ocean. L.A. is gigantic! If it wasn’t for being with my family and the security they provided, I don’t believe I would have made it past Las Vegas. Ha, ha!

Personally, I love the quaintness of small, isolated towns where everyone knows each other and looks out for each other. I truly believe that if our family had stayed in the town we lived in when I was born - Liberty, UT, population less than 300 - or the town we moved to soon after my birth - Idaho City, ID, population (when we last lived there) 126 - I would not be incarcerated today, or would ever have been.
