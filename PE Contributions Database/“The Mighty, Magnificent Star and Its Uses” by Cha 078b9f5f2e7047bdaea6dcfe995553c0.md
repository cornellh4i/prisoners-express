**“The Mighty, Magnificent Star and Its Uses” by Chadwick Keoni Majamay**

****Many regard stars as an inspirational point of reaching toward goals and ambitions. Stars are also utilized as words and phrases to express strong, special people and things. Due to the positions of stars within the skies, they can also be used for navigational purposes. When I think about it, I wonder why we call it two different things depending on the distance from which we observe them.

We call it a star when it is a great distance away and a sun when it is closer to us. Or when they are grouped together, they are called constellations. In any case, without stars or suns, life would cease to exist as they are our main source of energy for me, you, humankind--everybody.

According to me, stars are just wonderful and therapeutic to stare at and gaze upon. It provides me with calmness and beauty which I can’t find elsewhere. Additionally, it gives me inspiration in the works and writings I produce. Many of times, its energy radiating down upon me produces an incredible amount of creative energy that I am able to use in my writings and problem solving. It is God’s energy shining! Upon us to bless and nourish us!

The magnificent start and its radiance bless you all. It gives strength, courage, wisdom, inspiration, and life! Appreciate its beauty and power that resonates. Next time you see the stars in the sky? Imagine you are one of them shining for others to see and enjoy.
