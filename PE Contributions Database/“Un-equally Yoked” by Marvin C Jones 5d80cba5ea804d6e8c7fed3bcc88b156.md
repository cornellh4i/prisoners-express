**“Un-equally Yoked” by Marvin C. Jones**

Marriage, who would have thought it could be so hard!

My name is Max, I’m a good open minded male. . . I was the one who befriended any and everyone, I never let my family's prejudices influence or affect my decisions in life.

Take my marriage to Annabel for instance, we met at the park down by the pond, she was wading in the water and I just stood there mesmerized at how beautiful and succulent she looked. She looked up and saw me watching her and I could see fear in her eyes, I said, “Please don’t be afraid, I mean you no harm, I just think you are so beautiful.”

She looked at me without saying anything for a few moments, so I figured I’d frightened her too much and turned to leave when she said “Annabel.”

I stopped, turned back and said “Excuse me?”

She said, “My name is Annabel, and you are?”

I smiled and said, “I’m Max.”

She said, “Hello Max. Do you really think I’m beautiful?”

“Oh god yes,” I said.

For the next 6 months we dated, it was bliss until she asked me, “Max honey why haven’t I met your family?”

“Sweetie,” I said, “Remember how your whole family almost laid an egg when you brought me home? My family has zero understanding about mixed relationships, they’ve been trying to arrange a marriage for me for over a year now. . . but it’s you I want to marry.”

“Did you just say you want to marry. . me?” said Annabel.

“Yes, and I don’t care who doesn’t like it.”

“But, Max I. . . I won’t feel right unless you tell your family about us first,” she said.

“Okay, okay fine, but remember I warned you sweetie. Mom, Dad? Can you come up here for a minute?”

“Be there in a sec son, we are just putting the finishing touches on dinner,” said his dad.

“Okay, what’s going on son,” said his dad as he entered the room. Seeing Annabel standing there, both Mom and Dad bared their teeth in anger, but before they could act Max said, “This is Annabel and I’m going to marry her.”

His dad said “You are a fool and a disappointment boy, she is not one of us, she doesn’t belong in this family, are you totally blind?”

“Dad, enough. . . I love her and if she will have me I am going to marry her.”

“Son, you’ll learn the hard way. . . in the meantime get out of my house, you are no longer welcomed here!” Three years and three months later. . . the stress of an unequally yoked marriage rears its ugly head!

“Max, let’s go, why are you moving so slow. . . I don’t want to be late. . .If I’d listened to my family and married one of the gooseman brothers I would not worry about being late. I could have married Tom Gooseman you know.” Annable said. . .

“Maybe you should of married him,” he mumbled.

“What was that?”

“Nothing sweetie,” he said. . .

“That’s right, it better be nothing, and could you please get a move on or we will be late.”

Max remembers his father's words of warning, he starts to feel resentment for this female he’s married and before he knows it he snaps --- “You know what Annable, don’t you ever shut up? I’ve been a really good husband and provider for you, I give you everything you ask for and more. . .but all you ever do is put me down and nag nag nag (you’re too slow, you're too hairy, blah, blah, blah). Well no more, you hear me? No more!! And one more wisecrack about wanting a fox fur and I’ll cook your goose. . .understand me?” Annable looks into those steely eyes of his and knows her reign is over! She tucks her head, and Max with a satisfied smile on his face begins his journey of a new beginning.
