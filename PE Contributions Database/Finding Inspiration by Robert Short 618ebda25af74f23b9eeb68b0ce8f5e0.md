**Finding Inspiration by Robert Short**

I have found that while being locked up, I must daily find the positives in all that I do. Whether I am working the early shift in my unit laundry or coping with mental health issues while incarcerated or encouraging a friend who is having difficulties as he is readying himself for his release into the world in 6 weeks. We must always look for the positive angle. Personally, I find myself wanting to escape the reality of my situation through drugs (I am 4 ½ years sober) or the desire to act out as many others arounds me do. I have dealt with mental illness since I was 10 and usually in the world, I would “self medicate” with meth and weed and not acknowledge the truth about myself. But, I actually find it easier to stay clean in here by keeping in mind that as I am doing 85% on a 10 year sentence, I have absolutely nothing here to make me want to do a full 10 years instead of discharging in 8 ½ years. My biggest concern now is whether I can stay clean once I am out on the streets. But that’s another day. For now, I take it one day at a time and find something good everyday and thank God that not all my family has turned their back on me. I have my aunt Sandy and uncle Alan who have supported me with funds when they can afford it, but also to constantly encourage me to stay strong in my faith, to keep on my psych meds, and to always look for the positive regardless of how each day fills out. I know that today no matter what is but a temporary moment in my whole life. I am now just over the halfway mark on my temporary stay in the custody of the Dept. of Corrections, and I use this time to my benefit; to educate myself and discipline how I think and act despite all the hate and discontent around me. So never let your environment dictate who you are. Be who you are despite the environment around you.

Peace.
