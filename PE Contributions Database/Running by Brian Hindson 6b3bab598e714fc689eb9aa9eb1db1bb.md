**Running by Brian Hindson**

I ran to lose weight.

I ran to escape my surroundings.

I ran thousands of miles.

I ran until I lost toe nails.

I ran to be healthy.

I ran to eat what I wanted.

I ran to think.

I ran to race.

I ran to feel young.

I ran everyday, rain or shine.

COVID came and I wasnâ€™t allowed to run.

I will run for all those reasons.

I will run because I can.

I run.

I am a runner.
