**“I Was Only Looking” by Carl Nunnery**

You are walking down a sidewalk with your wife or girlfriend, when you notice a very attractive girl coming towards you. Your eyes become fixed on her. When she passes, you stop to turn around just to catch another look at her. In doing so, you make a facial gesture of approval and the girl you are with sees the attention you’re giving this other girl, with a look of disgust and pain on her angry face she sternly asks you, “What are you looking at?” which prompts your reply, “I was only looking.”

But why were you looking so intensely? Was it because:

She was better looking than your girl?

She was built better than your girl?

You don’t like the girl you’re with?

You think lust for another is acceptable?

You don’t care who you hurt by looking?

You think it’s acceptable to look as long as you don’t touch?

None of these seems to be good enough reasons to disrespect the one you’re with, does it, or even take the chance of losing the one you’re with over it! Have you ever stopped to think of how that makes your wife/girlfriend feel by your actions? The fact is, the damage could be irreversible!

So what are the side effects of your “wandering eyes”?

Betrayal? (perhaps)

Lust?

Suspicion?

Broken trust?

Disloyalty?

Feeling unwanted?

Used?

Disrespect?

Anger?

Is it a sin to look? Of course not! It is a matter of the heart, if you have sin in your hearts, you will have sin in your eyes!

If you look upon a person in a lustful way as was the person talked about at the beginning of this writing who was stopping to do a double-take at the girl passing by then mouthing a gesture as if saying “ooh”, then yes, his heart was not right and had sin in it. He not only disrespected the girl walking by but he disrespected the girl he was with!

In Matthew 5:29 it says “if the eye offends, do pluck it out”. This is not saying to literally pluck a sinful eye out but, first, the eyes can sin by what they see in lust; second, that the sinful eye could cause you to not enter into the Kingdom of God!

When you are with someone in a relationship, don’t be led away by evil thoughts of lust, let your thoughts be pure, and your eyes focused on the one you’re with!

In 1 Peter 1:22, it says “purify your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, to love one another deeply from the heart”. You must remember, relationships are built on trust and when you break that trust by allowing your wandering eye to lust, it exposes what is really to blame, your heart!

By your inappropriate actions of lust, your heart displayed your desires, which leads your partner to feel unappreciated and unwanted. How? If you were truly satisfied with your partner, you would not want to look up on anyone else in lust!

Can you imagine how your partner would feel if they saw you drooling over another person? I can tell you they would be heartbroken and devastated. You have destroyed a relationship that was supposed to be built on trust and placed it in uncertainty!

My point is this, if your heart is not right, it could cause the things you see to be in a sinful way and without saying a word, it could affect the person you may be with!

Be true to yourself and the one you’re with!
