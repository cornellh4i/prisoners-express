**“Iron Horse” by Carl Branson**

Silver nostrils

Billowing steam

Man’s sleep horse

Runs on legs of steel

Pulling coaches full

Of dreamers and schemers

Goin West

With sparkling are and spices

Returning East

Passing cowpoke and cacti

Along the way

Through fields of grain

And majestic cliffs

Echoing clickety-clack

Clickety-clack

Save for local commuter rail services like New York and Chicago’s subway system, San Francisco’s Bart, and Phoenix’s light rail, travel by train has all but been replaced by airlines.

Sadly, the relaxation and pleasures available with interstate and transcontinental excursions by train have been lost to our contemporary hurry-up, “I want it now” mentality. As a result, we routinely miss the benefits and beauty of what one country singer refers to as “the flyover states.”

In 1917 I had the opportunity to spend a summer month touring England, France, Switzerland, and Italy. Transcontinental travel in Europe was almost exclusively by train - and with the exception of Switzerland’s electric trains, coal burning steam locomotives were the predominant power source. Truly an experience I will not forget, but am unlikely to repeat anywhere in the world.

Rail beds are truly retreating into the misty fog of memory.
