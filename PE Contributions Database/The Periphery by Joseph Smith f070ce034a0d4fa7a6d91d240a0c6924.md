**The Periphery by Joseph Smith**

Of the cracked concrete crawled

upon to capture a clip, I can

relate to pressing your body

up against a thing

for the perception of beauty. Of

the darkness around the edges and

the low perspective, my mind wanders

to the edge of her darkness

where I was cut pressing up

against it and my wounds

are sometimes forgotten but never

healed and they always asked me

why, why here, and my responses

never sufficed then, but now,

I would say I was low

in perspective. Of the deep

blue sky, her eyes, but it’s so subjective the sky’s

black and grey and her eyes were never deep and though I

drowned it’s not the depth

unless by deep I meant the breath

she stole. Of the cracked concrete,

I resent your passive reception

of a warm body pressing into you and

your obliviousness to perceptions and

for this you earn my envy.
