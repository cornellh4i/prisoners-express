**Young Men on the Couch by Roderic Pippen Sr.**

We were three brothers, blood couldn’t make us any closer. Never would I imagine that the circle could be broken. Never would I imagine that the circle could be broken. But you can see the full trust with the two with their eyes closed and heads down. The third you can see his eyes open with an expression of dissatisfaction. He yearns for more than what he receives from this brotherhood, which would lead to a complete break in the circle. The thought was we would be loyal to the death and even thereafter. With the two on the outside in a full blown war of words. It leaves me in the middle. The part that is lost in it all is that I’m serving a LIFE sentence. How am I the one to keep things in order? When I’m fighting to get my life back? Regardless of what has transpired, we can always work out our differences. My issue is that there should be no issues between us, especially when the biggest issue is my freedom.

We all came from the same situation, raised by our grandmothers. Our birthdays are months within each other. And we’ve all had to defend one another. Whether it was in words, actions, or both. We been through more as a whole than in our separate lives. The hardest hit we took is when I lost trial. And from there is when things fell apart. So I believe that whenever I gain my freedom back, is when our brotherhood will repair itself. Look at it like this, who eats hamburgers with only one part of the bun? You may put all types of condiments on it, but without both buns, it’ll never be a whole hamburger. That’s how I look at it, without my brothers with me. I’ll never be complete, I can have other people serve as condiments. But in the end I need my brothers to be a whole hamburger.
