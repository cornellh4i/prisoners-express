**“Closest Call Yet” by Kevin Hale**

“Damn it’s ten minutes till count time. I’ll see you later I gotta shit.” These were my last words spoken, leaving bonds soon broken.

I close the door behind me locking myself in my cell, and as I hang up a blanket I see my so called brother Yo-Yo lurking maybe ten feet from my door. I dismiss this peculiarity sitting down on the toilet, and in three minutes passing hear a ket slide in the door’s lock. I don’t pay it much attention and yell “I’m shitting” and then hear Yo-Yo say “I know cuz.”

I look over my right shoulder and see Yoshi swinging an ice pick at my face. I lean to the left and get stabbed in my right eyebrow, as I try and get off of the toilet. He swings the ice pick again and I throw up my right arm punching him in the mouth with a left. Then as I try and pull up my pants I get stabbed twice in my back, therefore dropping my pants again. All I’m thinking is “I have to pull my pants up!” As I try to do so I get stabbed in the left side of my head, and then I grab a hand full of his balls yanking down as hard as I can while also squeezing as hard as possible. This causes Yo-Yo to run out of the cell leaving me laying on the floor. Something odd about this all is I never seen nor heard a C.O. do a count.

After washing myself off I put Neosporin in the holes in my back and filled them with toilet paper. I then glued my eyebrow and head shut with Gorilla Glue and crawled into the bed. That was a close call, but just the first of two.

After all this, I layed there for a week and six days eating ramen noodles and potato chips. This in turn sent me into diabetic ketoacidosis landing me in the University of Tennessee Hospital’s critical care unit. I didn’t ask for help from anyone because I refused to snitch on anyone; and knew they’d ask a million questions. I can’t recall how I got to the hospital, for the last thing I recall is trying to get out of my bed and then I woke up handcuffed and shackled to a hospital bed. Upon making up I was told 24 to 36 hours longer and my organs would’ve shut down.

Growing up a gang banger life seems to have been a series of close calls, yet the closest of all is… when the very gang I’ve killed for left me to die on my cell floor.
