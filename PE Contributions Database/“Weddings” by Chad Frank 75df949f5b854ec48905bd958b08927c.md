**“Weddings” by Chad Frank**

****The only wedding I’ve attended was that of my mom and stepdad, Bobby. Since I was barely three, I don’t have many memories of that day. I doubt there was much to remember, since all they did was go to the justice of the peace at city hall. Then, just like every special occasion in my family, there was a party with plenty of booze. Mixing my family and booze inevitably leads to a fight. I’m willing to bet that this one was between my mom and Bobby, considering the violent and tumultuous marriage that followed. When considering the dysfunctional nature of their marriage, it’s hard to believe they have been married for 34 years.

Come to think of it, my mom and Bobby’s marriage isn’t all that uncommon: most everyone I know are the byproducts of divorce and/or broken families.

Since I’m gay, I’ve only recently been allowed to legally get married. Not that I think I ever will. Combining my own toxic experience with relationships and marriage with a potential partner’s is a surefire recipe for an episode of the Jerry Springer Show.
