**Stars by Kwaneta Harris**

“He walked on water” -- that’s the impression you’d gather if you watched the family members discuss their deceased loved one. Family members never know anything about anyone. To say his transition from military to civilian life was “problematic” is a gross understatement. This military veteran they “honor” was a “monster” on good days!

America’s insatiable appetite for salacious sensationalism leads to a flurry creating “true crime” television shows. This has given rise to fulfillment of our childhood dreams--to be on television! Networks recognized a mutually beneficial demand and thus began paying family members for appearing. The more dramatic the performance, the better the ratings. Television shows lead to book deals, and if they’re lucky, a movie. “I can be a star,” they think. The television shows are a stepping stone, a path to fame and fortune.

Conversely, all aren’t like that. Family members who go on television shows to prevent crime, solve crime, or express displeasure with how their loved one’s case was handled are truly beneficial to society and are a service to the community. However, they aren’t when they are paid to appear on 5-7 different shows and change their story each time by purposely distorting facts and repressing unflattering truths about their loved ones. Why should the press let the truth get in the way of a good, moneymaking story? The same shows that only tell the “prosecutor's” side are the ones hopeful to be stars.

Nathaniel Hawthorne says, “No one man can wear one face to himself and another to the multitudes, without finally getting bewildered as which one may be true.” History has taught us that rapists and abusers rarely show that face to their extended family. Are the relatives on television expressing the truth? Maybe they really weren’t aware of the shamefully objectifying acts my monster (their relative) accomplished. Voltaire says, “We owe respect to the living. To the dead we owe only the truth.”

Or, in their thirsty quest for stardom, are they knowingly defending a misogynistic sadist? Is the lure of potential fame so powerful that the truth is overlooked collateral damage? I’d like to hope it’s the former, but I believe it’s the latter.

Everybody wants to be a star.
