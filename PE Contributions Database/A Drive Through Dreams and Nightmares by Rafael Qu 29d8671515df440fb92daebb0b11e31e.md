**A Drive Through Dreams and Nightmares by Rafael Quintanilla**

The complex way our brains simultaneously process all of our senses into a shared reality with humanity is amazing. Everyday, each of our consciences connect through countless social interactions in this world’s grand movie of life. But that’s only the surface.

Underneath, there’s a world where rules, laws, and logic do not apply. A world that has influenced the direction of many historical events and is constantly affecting the outcome of future ones. Each world is a reflection of the individual experiencing it.

Take these three college teens for example. They live a life of pressure, anxiety and chaos, but at the moment, the outer world is peaceful. Their closeness is obvious yet in their sleeping state, they’re lightyears apart.

Each of their minds are drifting through psychedelic murals of their own personality’s projections. Each subconscious taking the wheel and driving through a disorder of memories, desires, visions, and ideas, flowing together like dense liquid easing through a cluster of spiral meshed funnels. They’re destroying oceans with fire, fantasizing about the unspeakable, morphing into monstrous creatures, splashing through the nuclear core of the blazing sun, zooming at lightspeed through unexplored galaxies, communicating with supernatural beings, and solving the problems of the universe. Nothing’s making sense yet everything’s making perfect sense at the same time. Multiple colors and shapes are irrationally merging and dividing into a superb blend of unreplicatable art as their synapses and neurons electrify into an overdrive of rapid eye movement. They flip, spin, and whirl through an eternal span of possibilities as they lose their sense of direction in another dimension of beautiful chaos. They see glowing angels clashing with raging demons, godly heroes at war with deceptive villains, storms of fire battling blizzards of ice, mountains erupting into colossal dragons of lava, planets colliding, hurricanes of stars exploding across the cosmos, universes upon universes rapidly intertwining into a tornado of distorted stars crashing into an interweb of lightning, illuminating every atom in existence into one blinding light.

It ends with darkness, fading amnesia, and blinking blurred vision as their subconscious hands over the keys along with seeds of life altering ideas.
