**My Parents By Terence Thomas**

I never met my father, but I remember like it was yesterday when my mother told me the truth. “Lamone come here, I need to talk to you”. I was 9 years old, miles away from my home I always knew in Wichita Kansas, she pulled me into her bedroom to tell me that I had a different father than the one I had always assumed was my dad. That same Father that I thought I shared with my siblings, the same father that brought me christmas presents, the same father that showed unconditional love, the same father “Terry Kearney” I learned wasn’t my father at all.

At least not by blood, but any man willing to take the responsibilities of another, especially of a child is more of a man than most aspire to be. “Robert Knox” that was his name she told me that she’ll take me to meet him, “Tonya” that’s what she prefers to be called Latona is too formal, she has one of the most beautiful souls that you come close to touching. She was patient and had a natural gift for caring for kids.

It seems like it was only 2 weeks later when she called me in her room again. She asked me how I am doing in hindsight. I realize she was lost for words, She told me that the father I never met, the same one I have no memorable memory of, the one she told me shares the same blood as me died of liver failure from drinking too much. For some reason I was devastated, I cried even, but most importantly I was confused. Why would she tell me of a possible role model or “Father” (no, father figure) the life of a Father in mine has already been filled. Why would she tell me this? Send me through this? I was torn but it hurt more because I didn’t understand how to feel. That moment begat anger for a role model and instilled a sense of fear and abandonment. But I wasn’t the only one the next day in class we went in the cafeteria to watch as the towers fell. Unbeknownst to me how big this was. The thing that hit home to me in McAlester Oklahoma was that I had lost a father that I’ll never get to know.
