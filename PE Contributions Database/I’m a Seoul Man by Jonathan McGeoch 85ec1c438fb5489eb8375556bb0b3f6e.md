**I’m a Seoul Man by Jonathan McGeoch**

I’m just a good old country boy. But at the age of twenty-two, I was thrust into the big city of Seoul for two years - not knowing the language, culture, or food, and not being a city kind of guy. I hunt, fish, and camp, not shop around for fashion. But in two years, I learned a lot, had a lot of fun, and got to know the city. I have lived in much smaller cities a couple of times since, but in the end, I am a country boy.

It was in the heart of Seoul that I first learned about public transportation. At where I had previously lived, it wasn’t a real thing. But I learned to read a subway map, understand the bus lines and routes, the different colors of subway lines, and just how much like sardines Koreans can become on a Friday night. Good grief. But going home on Friday night, it is advantageous to have no room to move. That way, we couldn’t fall down drunk.

I also learned to eat other foods. I am not too picky, so I gladly ate dog, Kimchi, octopus, and all sorts of bugs. Hell, I even learned that liver is meant to be eaten raw. I liked it, but my wife never agreed on that one. I had the opportunity to engage in the cultural experiences that were unavailable in America. And I got to see the differences between our paradigms of life and the Eastern ways. I met some very interesting people and, in many ways, became integrated into the Korean way of life.

Though I have since lived in other countries and experienced many other things, and though I will will always just be a country boy, I will always consider myself to be a Seoul man.
