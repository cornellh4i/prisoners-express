**“Theatrics” by Tom Farlow**

Rose graced us with a recital this afternoon. She’s always thrived in the spotlight. Whether it is gymnastics, soccer, school, or performing arts, she’s one of those types who can charm the hardest of hearts and it seems effortless in our eyes.

Lately, our backyard has become Family Production Studios with all action: puppet shows, comedy or magic acts, and now, a talent show with kids from the neighborhood showcasing their abilities. There was Joe who lives two doors down, he was so nervous as his squeaky voice tried to sing one of those top four hits we’ll forget next week. Then, Jennifer and Stacey did a tap dance routine in black suits, top hats, and canes filling out their ensemble. But, they all took a backseat to Rose’s performance at the end of the day.

She has never needed some exorbitant costume to grab the audience. She took the stage in a simple blouse paired with a leopard skin shawl which she held on her shoulders. There was no awkward introduction of who she was or what she would be doing. None was needed. She simply raised the pipe to her mouth and began to play.

Now, over the past two weeks the house has been the sound studio for her practicing this song. I still do not understand how she can get it so right on stage. All we heard from upstairs or down the hall were snippets of a ballad that never seemed to flow together. We would glance at each other in worldless exchange, asking each other what she was playing. Rose never got frustrated, however. Day after day, she would plug away in her endeavor to master this piece. Here, we were having the full composition.

To hear my little girl play Dvorak’s “New World Symphony, 2nd movement” took away all of our breath. It’s a haunting melody that became that much more powerful emanating from an ordinary woodwind in the hands of an extraordinarily talented girl. My heart beamed with pride at all she was capable of doing in her life so far.

As the last note hovered over us and evaporated into the copse of trees around us, we could only applaud in a state of awe, feeling our praise did little justice to the present we just experienced.
