**“Family Trips” by Steven P. Arthur**

When I was just a boy, most of our family vacations were spent in Yosemite National Park. Before my mother’s accident, Dad used to say, “It’s the closest you will ever get again to the garden of Eden.”

After his passing, as promised, I would take my wife and two boys there. It was my turn to continue the family tradition as his father had done for him.

I drove them miles high into a secluded area above the regular camp areas. This was a place I knew very well. At this altitude, it’s a lush and beautiful natural theme park of mountains covered in red Wood trees that increase in size as you zig-zag up the two lane road. At the crest you’ll find trees five stories tall and as wide as two city busses, perpetually shrouded in a fine misty fog.

“Ok monkeys. We have arrived!” I told the boys.

“What do you think sweetheart?” I said, looking over to Jen.

“It’s beautiful. Really it is. I’m just a little car sick.” Holding her stomach and looking out the window she asked, “Should we be so close to the edge?”

“Ya. It’s fine. The boys know not to play too close. Besides, Dad brought me here when I was younger than they are, and I turned out fine.” She didn’t look convinced so I added, “And we are setting up way over there, by the park benches.” I pointed over to the tree line.

“Alright. Everybody out. Let’s get some pictures, then setup the tents.”

The boys jumped out and ran around the car while Jen and I unpacked. The cool pine scented air cleared my head and renewed my determination for this trip. I took out my digital camera and took scenic pictures of the mountains stubbled with giant trees and the river thousands of feet below.

“Ok. Jen, take the boys, and stand over there so I can get Half Dome in the background.”

“Come here boys. Stay close,” she told them.

“Mommy can we have some s'mores?’ asked Tommy.

“Yes, yes, yes, I already told you a million times in the car.” She smiled and punched his nose.

“How are you baby boy?” she then asked Robbie. “Your tummy still hurt?”

He was two years younger than his brother of six, and like his mom, he didn’t do well with motion or altitude sickness. He nodded his head and held his stomach.

Robby said, “Mommy, I don't like this.”

“Boys get close to Mommy. No, robbie stand by your brother. Now scoot back further. A few more steps..”

“Daniel we’re already too close. Just take the damn picture.”

She was aggravated and I couldn’t blame her. It wasn’t her idea of a vacation; it was mine. She wanted hot beaches, sand, sunblock and any icy margarita.

“Everybody smile.” I took a few pictures then joined them. I put my arm around Jen’s shoulder to turn her around so she could appreciate the view.

I told her. “You know I love you, right?” Before she could respond, I pushed her out over the edge, where the ground ceased and the sky began. Other than the brief flap of her arms, she went without resistance. I was surprised really. She didn’t even make a sound, not even an involuntary yelp.

Then I looked down at the boys who's tood there alternating looks over the edge with looks at me. Their eyes wide and blue as the sky. I picked Robbie up and kicked Tommy in the back. A glancing blow that half turned him as he joined his mother over the edge. I could see the disbelief on his face, but it only lasted a moment before he was out of sight too. Still holding Robbie, I held him eye level.

“Your mommy and brother had a real bad accident, didn't they?” I said. He nodded his head in response.

“It was close, but I knew you were a keeper, just like Daddy was. Grampa would be very proud.”
