**“I Am a Mosquito of Philosophy Washed Up on Written Shores” by Larry Harwell**

“I never asked to be born!” I recall during a tantrum telling mom and dad this. Now my esoteric friends tell me, “Oh yes Larry, you did indeed asked to be born. You just don’t remember, for you waded through the forgetful river, just before coming here.” Next time I am going to pole vault across that rascal!

I was introduced to life by my Dad’s orgasm on my conception day. I don’t know if mom experienced a similar joy, for she did not like the man. As I grew up I found that I did not like him either. He seemed to live in a perpetual unhappy and angry state. Eventually, he left our family to find happiness, yet experienced unhappiness in worse degrees in other women. Perhaps on his deathbed, he realized he did not like himself either. I may never know for I called him when I heard he was dying. He answered the phone. I said “Hello Father, this is your son Larry.” He told me he had no son Larry and slammed the phone down, my subsequent calls were ignored. I was 6 years old when I last spoke with him. I was then 45. What mystery did he take to his grave? On his next journey I hope he jumped that damn river and remembers the misery of his last existence and sheds some of that baggage!

If it is true that we continue to reincarnate to grow and evolve, how can I hold anything against anyone? They are dealing with a bat guano storm of past experiences and traumas. Even though we don’t remember, I suspect those experiences are somehow encoded in our DNA. This may explain the overwhelming misery of this tiny planet. A few enlightened soul seem to arise out of the mist of misery, but we murder them pretty damn fast.

Now add this to the mix. Entities from other planets and galaxies come here to incarnate and experience life on planet Earth. What kind of experiences are these beings bringing here? We have all met people that seem to be a little too alien-ish. Perhaps our president will get the new space force to build a wall around Earth and keep those illegal aliens out. Make Earth great again!

Having been raised by CBS, a favorite character of mine was Sergeant Schultz of Hogan’s Heros. He was the consummate survivor. His catchphrase “I see nothing! I hear nothing! I know nothing!”, makes him the master sage. As a young child it was hilarious. As an aged man, his wisdom is unsurpassable. At 20 years of age, I knew it all. Ah, to be that ignorant again. I knew exactly who I was, my purpose in life, and I had a solution to every ill of mankind. Being a favorite of the gods, exacerbated my egoism. Now these same gods have brought me to humility. Oh they are a fickle bunch! My answers have turned to questions, and in the balances I find myself wanting. I am currently on top of the debris pile
