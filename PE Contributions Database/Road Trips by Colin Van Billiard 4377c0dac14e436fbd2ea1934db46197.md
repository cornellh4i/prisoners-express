**"Road Trips" by Colin Van Billiard**

Remember when I was locked up when I was a kid? 

Staff in the summer used to take us everywhere, but one place stood out the African Lion Safari. We traveled via an old, rickety van. Upon arrival, we saw a myriad of animals. We then ate and quickly made our way back to the van, where we had about an hour and a half ride back to our residence. We listened to music and laughed and joked as we traveled. 

Some tried to go to sleep, but the rest of us would play games to pass the time. I loved looking out of the window at the cars, trucks, beautiful people, and the beautiful houses and buildings that swiftly passed. I loved this road trip better than any of the other road trips I had made in the past on my own. Watching airplanes in the sky, boats in the water and cars on the road reminded me of what there was left to experience on the outside. 

This day was so fun just hanging around and seeing animals playing in their little water park. When we returned, I **couldnâ€™t wait to get out and get on the road, and even possibly write a book about my road trip and the many road trips to come.
