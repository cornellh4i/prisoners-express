**The Reminder by Brain Fuller**

Pappy was over 100, but he still wanted us to take him out there from time to time. He’d grab his hat and cane saying “C’mon let’s go have us a lookee!” He kept on cutting the grass well into his 80s. Now, that job had been passed down to me. I guess he just wanted to make sure that the old place was getting it’s proper respect.

He’s been gone over 20 years now. And I always mow the place every week. There remains an eerie quiet reverence about the land. As kids, we played in the woods behind our house. The trail goes a long way before it opens up into the meadow. It’s been there all this time. Silent. Alone. A guardian of the memories and lessons we should never forget.

The first time we crested that rise, all of us knew we had trespassed upon something sacred. There, on the other side of the hill, as far as our eyes could see, were the headstones. Too many to count, formed out in rows perfectly landscaped. Now, all of us understood why Pappy was so adamant about us not going into the meadow. He was afraid we’d be too young to understand.

All his life, he carried that tremendous burden of guilt. Somehow, he felt personally responsible. He tried to explain that while they were “over there”, dodging bullets and bombs, trying to save the world from tyranny; the real enemy came back with them. It was an insidious invisible evil that meanly wiped out the entire town. “We’d already been exposed to the germs and built up immunity. But when we came back home, people here didn’t stand a chance”.

After lunch, we piled into his truck and rode into town. He took us to the library. He hugged the librarian like old friends do. She sat us at a long table and quickly returned with several books and some large bound volumes of newspaper clippings yellowed with age. Then we learned of the influenza pandemic from meanly a century before.

Familiar and entire neighborhoods were wiped out. And there in the old black and white photograph stood the chapel on the hill. People were laid out on the pews inside. This town didn’t have a real hospital back then. Just a little one that was soon overwhelmed. Churches, schools, and even barns became makeshift care centers, trying to attend to the sick and dying.

Pappy pointed out a skinny young man wearing overalls, holding a shovel in a faded photograph. A priest and another old man stood next to a coffin on a wagon. He wiped a tear from his eye and said “They even started holding Sunday service outside because nobody wanted to go back inside”.

Pappy was never one to be idle. He taught us to live, love, laugh. He would always say, “There’s nothing new under the sun. What was once, will be again”. His headstone is one of the easiest to find. It’s got his old manual push mower beside it. The old chapel still sets empty. There’s several newer churches in town. But I still like to go out there and pray.
