**“Sisters of St. Blase” by Leo Cardez**

The Sisters of St. Blase were a mean, old, ugly bunch of witches.

My sister and I grew up in a lower middle class, primarily Hispanic neighborhood on the south-side of Chicago; raised by immigrant Mexican parents; who were devout Catholics. St. Blase was our community Catholic church -- its campus included the large Cathedral, a convent, the priest's home, a K-8 grade school, parking lot, and small park. We attended the Sunday noon (Spanish) mass religiously (pun intended). And when the time came we were expected to attend St. Blase kindergarten in our finely pressed blue and white uniforms. And we did.

My sister and I didn’t speak English. We were raised by parents who only spoke Spanish in a Spanish speaking community. The Sisters had little patience with our plight. They would resort to mocking and belittling us in front of the whole class or worse: washing out our mouths with soap when we accidentally said something in Spanish in an effort to be understood. We couldn’t understand what was expected of us and often were punished with detention, which meant an hour on our knees in Chapel, or having our hands smacked with a giant ruler by Head Sister Josephine. We endured all of this quietly, we never complained to our parents, but I would often see my sister’s eyes well up in tears either on the walk to school or the walk home. I, being two years younger, felt hopeless. It was a miserable experience and ruined school for me. I acted out because I felt stupid and insecure. I stopped caring about the punishment and accepted it as a badge of honor.

My sister endured three years at St. Blase; I only have to endure one before the doors were closed for lack of funding. I’m sure some of the other children complained and their parents pulled them from the school; eventually dropping attendance below survival. Thank God.

It would take many years for me to fully recover and enjoy school and learning. My sister diligently completed all mandatory education, but would fear and avoid any unnecessary schooling throughout the rest of her life. The Sisters really did a number on us -- I blame them for a lot.
