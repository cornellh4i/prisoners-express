**"Smoking Boys"** **by Shawn Blake**

I started smoking at 5 years old. At least that’s when I tried to smoke for the first time. I continued trying until I was 8 years old when I learned how to inhale without coughing my lungs out and turning green with sickness. I wanted to smoke so bad that I once tried rolling up newspaper, lighting the end, and sucking the smoke through the tube into my lungs. This made me cough so hard I dropped the lit cylinder on the living room carpet, setting it on fire. My brother and sister were also a party to this experiment and put the fire out before it burned the house down. Luckily for us, the carpet was only a big piece of loose carpet that had been folded in half and thrown over the floor. It covered almost the whole living-room though. We dragged everything out of the living room, turned the carpet over so the burned spot was now hidden, vacuumed it, and moved everything back in its place. Perfect!

Another time my best friend and I stole some cigarettes and matches and hurried to our fort (a stack of hay-bales we had rearranged to our liking) and commenced to light up--at least tried to light up. The wind kept blowing out the matches. Match after match would die out and get tossed over the side of the fort wall.

Finally the cigarette was lit, and we settled back to enjoy it. That’s when the Volunteer Fire Department’s siren went off. A fire! Where’s the fire? We jumped up looking around for the fire. That’s when we discover we’re standing on top of it: apparently one of the matches hadn’t been out. We abandoned our fort, managing to escape unseen.

The way I learned to inhale is a strange story. The town I lived in was really small. When something new caught our attention, we were hooked. One day, a friend and I spotted a stranger smoking a cigar. The way he was inhaling was new to us. he would take a drag into his mouth, force the smoke back out with his tongue, suck it back in through his nose to his lungs, and then blow it back out. The French inhale.

After a thorough observation of this method, we headed over to our hideout to practice. We quickly picked up this new method of smoking, and as a result, we were able to inhale normally in just a short time after. Weird!	Being so young it was hard to get cigarettes. I would raid ashtrays, pickup butts off the ground, steal them… I became an expert at stealing them from grocery stores. If I got caught, I would start crying and say my brother made me do it. This usually worked. As I got older (10 to 12), I found it easy to steal anything if I was careful.

I was not unpunished for my delinquency. My parents tried to stem my smoking with physical beatings, loss of privileges… I was even forced to smoke packs of cigarettes at a single sitting until I got so sick I couldn’t continue. The last couple of times I got caught, I was forced to eat a cigarette. Nothing worked. That was when I was 13. After that, I was left alone.

By the time I turned 16 years old, I was smoking a pack a day. I never let myself exceed this amount. If I did, it was because I gave out too many. At around this time I started getting locked up and couldn’t smoke. But I always started again when I was released.

I graduated from juvenile detentions only to be in prison within the year. Smoking was allowed back then (1987), but in the 90’s, smoking was prohibited in the institutions I was placed. I would still smoke whatever smuggled cigarettes came in and always smoked when I got out. As you can imagine, I “quit” several times. I always started again.

Finally in 1994, I met my future wife, Melanie. WIth her help, I was able to truly quit. It was hard at first, but I haven’t had a cigarette since Easter weekend 1994. Twenty-one and a half years ago! I’m proud of this success.

It amazes me what people do to their bodies. I started in 1973 to slowly kill myself with cigarettes (and other vices). But I’m still here 42 years later. I believe it’s because I stopped smoking when I did.
