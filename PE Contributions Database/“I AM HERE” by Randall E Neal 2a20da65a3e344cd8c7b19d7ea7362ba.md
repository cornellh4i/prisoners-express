**“I AM HERE” by Randall E. Neal**

“I am here God. I feel so alone. I’ve been dangling from a rope of incertitude for many, many years. Now the rope has come unwound and I’ve fallen into a darkened pit of despair. I feel trapped behind a mountain of fear that I cannot move. The fear of your rejection mortifies my soul. I also feel trapped behind a mountain of doubt. I want to believe God, but how could you love me or care for me after all the wrongs I’ve done in my life? I do believe that you are real - but who are you? I never took the time to learn anything about you - I thought I could handle everything myself. I believed that since I was suppose to be in control of my life, I didn’t need anyone to help me. I was wrong God - I did need someone. Now God, I simply cannot hide behind this mask of bravery - I’m scared. There is nobody I can turn to that will understand - nor can I fully trust. So, today I have come to this place of solitude and separated myself from the hustle and bustle of this boisterous world in hope that you can hear my concerns - my plea for help!”

“I’ve heard it said that if I humble myself before your throne of grace, you will hear my voice. Yet, I feel so unworthy to call upon you God, unworthy of your love or mercy. Still - I am here.” As I sat trembling on the edge of the dock, I closed my eyes. I felt the utter silence engulf my soul. Suddenly, my eyes popped open as my head swiveled around to see whom had snuck up behind me. Nobody was there. How could that be? I felt the presence of someone and I heard him whisper, “I am here”. Didn’t I?

“I am here my child. Lay your heavy burdens down and tell me your concerns. Today, I will move your mountain of fear. Put all your trust in me and I will move your mountain of doubt.”

As if for the first time, I noticed the two mountains before me and the mountain in the far distance. Then I heard the whispering voice once more. “Do not focus on the mountains that stand before you my child, put your focus on the canopy of freedom above”. First, I looked down at the reflections on the waters that surrounded me. The two mountains appeared to be even further apart. It felt like someone was leading me through the valley that lay ahead, yet, I felt no fear. Then I looked upward and fixed my eyes on the pearly gates of heaven’s beauty and I felt a blanket of peace embrace my soul. I closed my eyes and began to picture God in my mind’s eye. After a brief moment, it seemed as though I could see Him sitting patiently on His golden throne of grace awaiting to hear my concerns - my plea for help.

“I am here” whispered through my mind from beyond the realm of my earthly existence. As I sat in the silence of awestruck wonder, I knew my concerns were many. Where could I even begin? “Just love me” I softly whispered. I felt the tears trickle down my cheeks and suddenly, my concerns began to flow freely from my broken heart of despair.

“God, are you able to peer into my eyes and gaze upon my very soul? Are you the light of love that can pierce my inner darkness? Can you see the iron gates that imprison my broken heart? Are you able to break the chains and fetters that so sternly bind me down? Can the power of your love open this dark tomb that blinds me from your truth? Your word says that you love me - yet, are you able to feel my pain? Can you see my inner struggles, my hidden secrets, the depths of my scars?”

“Could you possibly know my dreams - my deep desire to fly free? Is your mercy able to forgive my faults and receive me as I am? Will you cleanse my hidden shame and wash me whiter than snow? Will you hold my hand with fingers locked and guide me through my trials - my tribulations? Just love me God - though I am hidden - a diamond covered by darkened sin. Show me compassion, that I too may show others compassion. Heal my pains, that I too may heal the pains of others. Dry my tears, that I too may dry the tears of others.”

“Shatter these iron gates that imprison my broken heart. Open this dark tomb and let my soul fly free! Just love me God, that I may learn to love you. Give to me your tender mercy, your gracious grace, the sweetness of your passion. Teach me God to show others tender mercy, gracious grace, and sweetened passion. Give to me the unfeigned love that I so desire, That I too may learn to give you the unfeigned love you so desire. Today God, I surrender my broken life at the throne of your grace. Just love me, my Father, my Savior, just love me.”

As I cried in the serenity of my Creator, I heard His quiet still voice whisper on the winds of change, “I am here. I will never leave you nor forsake you. In your times of need, call upon my name. I will uphold you with my right hand and lead you through the valley of the shadows of death in your turbulent world. When you seek me, you will find me. In me you will find peace. In me, my child, you will find rest for your weary soul.” The weight of the world lifted from shoulders as I wept in freedom. Oh that day! That wonderful, wonderful day!

I opened my eyes and stared at the pearly gates of heaven. I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that I had been basking under the rainbow of God’s radiant love. God heard my concerns - my plea for help - He led me to His golden gates of freedom. As I confessed my sins, God faithfully forgave me of all my sins and washed me whiter than snow. He broke the chains and fetters and opened the lid to my dark tomb of despair and now I fly free in God’s kingdom of indescribable joy. Oh, the splendor of God’s amazing grace - how sweet the sound. I once was lost - now I’m found. I was blind - now I see - my Heavenly Father’s love for me!

My friends, if you too feel trapped behind the mountains of fear and doubt, simply go to a place of solitude, close your eyes and humble yourself before God’s throne of grace and ask Him to forgive your sins. He will be faithful and forgive all your past sins and give your life a brand new start. He will lift your heavy burdens and open your dark tomb of despair. God will allow you to spread your wings and fly free in His majestical kingdom of unfeigned love. My friends, there is no sweeter melody than that of God’s tender voice whispering on the winds of change - “I am here!”

Love Always In Christ,
