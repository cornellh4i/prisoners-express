**Window by Cesar Hernandez**

The word window comes from the Old Norse “vindauga,” which means “wind-eye.” The Old English word for window is “eag-pyrl,” which means “eye-hole.” From birth, our eyes are the inborn windows through which we know the world.

The earliest windows were holes in a wall. The human journey between opening and closing has always been about the relationship between our walls and our windows. In a cob house, an ancient type of dwelling built of mud and clay, there was always a wall that had a truth window. This wasn’t a window to the outside, but an opening that showed what the wall was made of. We should do well if our walls had truth windows, so we should be honest about what they’re made of.

When shut in or closed off, we need windows we can rely on. Our health and ability to dream depend on having life-giving windows. Like a window through the dark clouds when they come, or a truth window to show what our walls are made of, or a window to the soul so we can access what is eternal. It helps to remember that windows go both ways: letting things in and out, and letting us see and be seen.

Windows worth opening fill us with truth for another time. Each moment that touches us is a window to the vastness of life. We begin to see that trying so hard to keep our moments of love, mystery and wonder. From going back into the unseen depth of life is like trying to keep a whale from re-entering the sea once it’s breached the surface. Better to have windows that face the sea.

We’re each left to live our days with the windows of our hearts open, so that grace has a way in. Whenever the majesty of life presents itself, it’s our humble, simple work to open our windows and receive it, fully, with gratitude.

Ultimately, each of us is a window through which the great forces of life enter the way light fills a home. Through us, the source of life can revive those who are bruised and those who are waiting to find their way. So, hard as it is at times, leave your window open and become the opening itself until your walls come down. When the walls come down, the openings are everywhere.
