**“Tricky Business” by James Bauhaus**

I came late to a party at Tenkiller Lake one time. This was at six-shooter camp, in the Cookson Hills, where we had 200-foot cliffs. It is the most scenic place in Oklahoma: a beautiful place tucked away deep in thick hardwood forests. All of this beauty was hidden in the dark when I drove up on my Yamaha at around midnight.

It was the last day of school. The moon was full. The campfire was raging. All of my friends were staggering, or at least wobbly - drunk. They offered me beer and spirits, but, being kind of an outsider, they mostly couldn’t know that I don’t drink. More properly, I didn’t drink in 1965. My parents liked to drink, so I didn’t. One of the jocks tried to insist.

“You gotta try this, man. It’s Seagram seven; real smooth!” His big buddy told me, “This is Canadian Windsor. You won’t puke this up!” (Like I’d take advice from people who packed their lips with tobacco and spit reddish-brown filth everywhere while they talked and wiped their chins with the back of their hands.)

A friend noticed me getting sideways of the ball-chasers and rescued me with a shout above the babble of 30 classmates and the crackle of the fire.

“Jay! Come here, man! We’re over here! Hurry! You gotta see this!” The jocks liked it when I saluted them before making my way around the fire. Both were hot to join the service and kill people in Vietnam. Taylor got fragged by his own men while he slept with the ROTC: Monty triggered a betty while on patrol and wished he was dead the rest of his life.

Off in the dark, 50 feet from the bonfire, the Hippie group stood in a circle, laughing, chuckling and passing a joint. In the middle was Smittie. He was drunk and swaying back and forth, eyes slit, smiling, trying to enjoy his high through the alcohol without quite falling off of a big, 900cc Harley Sportster. The joint made it to him. Smittie wiped the spittle off the end, reared back, sucked in a big hit, then lost his balance. He fell over backward, feet flying up in the air, coughing and hacking his lungs out, all the way to the ground. He hit the grass head first, flipped over onto his belly and lay there, groaning. We all roared together with laughter. Wendy went to aid him; see if he was really hurt. She helped him up. Smittie blinked, squinted all around, stopping at me. “Jay!” he gasped. “Good to see you! You’ll do me a favor, won’t you?” he had a really disarming smile, which is probably a big reason Wendy was with him. Lowering his voice, he told me, “I need you to get rid of this scooter for me. I never should have bought it. If I keep it, it’s going to kill me. See what it did to my knee, man?” he showed me his road rash, all puckered and scabby.

“I’m not stealing your wheels,” I answered flatly, guessing he wanted to pull an insurance scam.

“No,” he replied. “It’ll be fun. Just drive it off the cliff. Nobody will do it for me, and we’re too drunk anyway. You’re smart and sober. You can do it easily!”

I am not a sucker for flattery. The other wanted to see some, Diot tried to kill himself doing something stupid. The idea did not appeal to me. They all believed the drop was 200 feet, the limit of Mexican cliff diver. Everybody seemed to know people who had jumped down and survived, especially the jocks. Of course, everybody could be liars, fools or instigators. The more they tried to talk me into it, the less I wanted any part of it. “No, man,” I finally told them, “I’m not the thrill-seeker type.”

As the party continued, the subject kept coming up, mostly as dares to friends who kept telling us how easy it would be. The higher I got, the more I thought about it. Throwing boulders over the side took six seconds for the noise of the splash to come back up. The math said that this was indeed 200 feet. It also told me that I’d hit at 132 miles per hour. One of the other guys who paid attention in school was Fred. he made his own calculations. They were just as harrowing as mine. All the survival-believers switched sides to join the death-cultists.

People began passing out, slinking off into the privacy of the forest in pairs, or driving off and back for more supplies. One of our groups, a tiny, swarthy Italian girl named Linda offered me a white cross. I laughed at this, then convinced her to let me buy four from her, which I dropped all at once with a swig of Budweiser. We talked for half an hour. Then we had to get up. Our minds revived up even faster than our bodies. We gathered two armloads of fallen branches out of the forest while we cooked up a plan. We threw them both on the dying fire. It blazed up to new heights as we stirred the coals. Soon as it began crackling, I loosed my plan, shouting, “who wants to see me ride this big, heavy piece of shit into the drink?”

“You mean over the cliff?”

“Hell yeah!” I replied, “But I’m not going to kill myself for free! Smittie! Pass the hat around! See what you can get for me.” the “hat” was a greasy Fritos bag. When it came back, it only had $36 in it.

Linda sneered at them, her lip curling with the cutest amount of contempt. “This is shameful!” She scolded. “How about if I go with him? I’m taking the sack around once for me, and it better be full when I finish - everybody!” she shrieked. “Wake up and come back to the fire! You’ll want to see us smash into the water!”

Linda, Smittie and I worked for the crowd until false dawn arrived. Soon as we could see the bottom, it was on! The old trash-fire was hard to start, but fast to warm up. Taking it down the road and around the bonfire gave me a sense of what kind of soggy dog is was. It was like driving half of a car. Linda hopped on back, clamping her arms around me tightly. The thing was so damned loud that I couldn’t hear anyone gasp as I revved it up, popped the clutch and sprinted over the lip. But I could see their eyes pop and their mouths gape before we sailed into space at 40 mph. I shouted “Whee!” for effects, though I doubt anyone heard me but Linda. She screamed involuntarily, but quickly got control of herself. Six seconds of free fall is a lot of time to pass while making sure we got it exactly right. Step one was to gas the engine, which makes the rear wheel twist the bike into an almost vertical wheelie. The Harley was so obese that it took half our fall to do this. Then I ricked it loose; pushing it ahead of us. Linda knew that we didn’t want her to stay on top of me, and behind, to knock our heads together when we hit. It did scare me for a moment. When I kind of panicked, thinking she had frozen instead of remembering the plan. Before I could shout “get off me!” and try to peel her hands off my chest, she released me, pushed loose, and joined me in screaming “Point your toes!” She knew exactly what to do and did it perfectly.

The scooter hit first, making a huge splash 30 feet ahead of me. A quarter-second later, I hit toes first with a slight backward tilt to keep the water from jackhammering up my nose. While I was underwater, I heard and felt the shockwave of Linda hitting the water behind me. We went so deep that it took a moment to struggle back up to the surface. The Harley was a shadow, sinking to the bottom. On the way up, I turned to see Linda. She stroked like a mermaid, her lithe, curvy body strong and sure. We laughed together at the top, then raced to the rocky shore. We took our time winding our way back up the trail to the top, each an arm about the other’s waist. The speed we had eaten still revved our minds and bodies. It had made our insane little trip comparatively easy. Without this little boost in intelligence and planning, our crazy escapade would have truly been some really tricky business.
