**… Getting Back to our Roots by Shawn Miller**

It’s very important to understand ourselves and our ancestors. Not just looking within, but connecting with our ancestors. By doing what they did to understand life. One day I’ll be able to do this again when I go home. What better way to get connected with nature and our past ancestors. By doing, like I said, to experience what they did, to experience them and the divine. So let’s get out and enjoy nature, our past, ancestors and the Divine. Let’s get back to our roots.
