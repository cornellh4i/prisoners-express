**“Double Exposure” by Steven P. Arthur**

****My first experience with a dark room was with my dad, and he took a photography class at the local community college. I’m not sure why, but he has been taking pictures and collecting cameras since the early ‘60s. He showed family photos he took as well as pictures from his days in the Vietnam War.

I don’t know if he was allowed to, but he brought me to class with him one evening. There was only one other person there who didn’t pay any attention to us. Dad gave me a tour of the classroom and he projects displayed on the walls. He took me to the back where the dark room was.

Even at seven years old, I had a pretty good idea of what happened in the dark room, and why it was necessarily called the “dare room.” I can’t say I wasn’t a little afraid. It was called a dark room, and there was a red light just outside the door, and the door was black and locked from the inside. Dad wanted to show me how to develop a photograph so I followed him in.

Inside was a small room not much bigger than a walk in closet. There was a sink with a long countertop and what looked like a really big microscope. The smell was strong but not unpleasant. Developing chemicals, my dad called them. He told me what they were, but my child mind didn’t absorb them.

Dad put some rolls of undeveloped film on the counter and turned to me, “You ready?” I nodded, and he engaged the deadbolt on the door and flipped off the lights. Darkroom was right: I couldn’t see anything. Even after a few minutes in absolute darkness, my eyes adjusted, but unlike dark rooms at home, there was no light coming through the crack in the door jams or from underneath. Just when I felt the first moments of terror creep up on me, the room lighted up in a blood red luminance.

“This is the light we can work with while unexposed film is out. Any other light will ruin the exposure,” Dad told me. He moved like a surgeon over his patient. Deftly opening the film, he took down bottles of liquids and poured each of them out into large, shallow trays. He did some other things so fast I couldn’t keep up, so I let my eyes wander around the room. There wasn’t much, but there was another little door in the far back that looked like a storage closet. Some shelves with boxes marked “left-overs” and “special care” were around, and directly behind us and across from the counter was a small wall painted an unusually dark, dull black paint. As I stared at it, I felt like it was staring back. The paint was perfect and had no flaws to show depth, almost as if nothing was there.

When I looked back at Dad, he had film loaded up in the big microscope-looking device. He said this was an old technique, but it was the best the school could afford. Most pictures don’t get developed anymore because they’re digital.

He turned to the machine, and it made a noise. “OK, that’s it,” Dad said. I didn’t say that I was disappointed, but all that work and that was it.

He took the piece of paper out from under the machine and told me it was special, photographic paper. He put it into one of the trays filled with chemicals, and I watched as a picture of our trips to Santa Monica beach appeared from the blank white abyss. It was magical: I couldn’t help but smile, and Dad smiled back at me. “That’s like magic, Dad.”

“Yes, not many photos are developed by the photographer anymore. That’s only part of the reason I brought you today. You wanna see something really, really cool?” I did.

He took a silver box with some fancy carvings from a shirt pocket. It was about the size of a cigarette pack, and it didn’t have any obvious hinges that I could make out in the dim red light, but with a twist of his wrist, it opened. From it, he produced a large but single photo negative, and he loaded it up like before then asked me to step back. Instead of putting photographic paper on the counter beneath the machine, he pointed the image at the black wall behind us.

The image was of a small mouse near the bottom of the wall. I recognized him immediately. The all white fur except the little black spot on his forehead reminded me of Indian women. The image was of Mickey, my pet mouse. He was my first pet, and I loved him even after Mrs. Kitty decided he was lunch, leaving me to find his remains smattered all over my room. He had been dead for a few months, but to my little heart, he would always be my friend. “Dad, I miss Mickey.”

“I know. He was a good mouse as far as mice go. You ready?” I nodded, and he turned off the red light. The only thing visible was Mickey, the ghostly image staring bright from the wall. Dad clicked the machine, and the image disappeared as we were immersed in total darkness.

Then I heard a squeak. The red light came on again, and sitting against the wall and twitching his little whiskers, he was all white with a little black dot on his forehead.

I put Mickey into a box and took him home. That was 30 years ago, and though Dad passed away recently Mickey is still with me and not a day older. Dad left me the little silver case which was empty when I first opened it, but I have a large negative that was with it. A picture of Dad before the cancer, and thankfully, the school still runs the photography class.
