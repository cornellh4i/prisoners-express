Some say the good old days are only the good old days because people are so old they can only remember the good parts. I think the struggles of former generations made us pull together as a nation. We as a country haven’t seen the common struggles of our former generation. And I think that’s because our ancestors thought over or around the problems. That suffering helped them often outthink issues. Which is why we’ve evolved and technology reigns. Coming together over struggles has become part of our culture. Even when we can’t think over or around our problems. I was born in 1983. So I’ve seen the tech transition as I grew up, I used to go over to Mamans and hang out for hours just talking and drinking coffee. Those aren’t things commonly seen any longer. And they’re memories many of our youth won’t make any effort to create. And so they won’t share memories of their elders after they pass on. They won’t learn a lot of where they come from or much about their culture unless it’s online. Then it’s lifeless, without empathy or expression. Without the human connection and experience. There was a lot of hard living in the old days. And there has a lot of parity in pulling out all the obstacles to over it in love! In the old days that’s how it was. Even if it meant callouses or shed blood. Because it has something like a pious act. Some may say I’m old, I’m not. When I was free my cellphone didn’t have a color screen. My first TV was a small black and white hand me down. I grew up country. I was taught to honor faith, love, family, culture, and a fighting american spirit. I do my all to epitomize that. The world will attack goodness. The enemy of light is always available. I am optimistic that this will bring our country together to stand against it, just like in the old days. Even if we don’t see it as much as we should in prison. Our nation needs leaders. Our prisons need leaders! As long as we stay true to just principles and the lessons of our elders we still haven’t lost touch with the old days. May they live on in our hearts.
