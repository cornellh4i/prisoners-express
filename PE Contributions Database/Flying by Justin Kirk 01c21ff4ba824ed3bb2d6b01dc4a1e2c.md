**Flying by Justin Kirk**

I know very little about flying. In fact I’ve only flown twice my whole life. Once to Disney World in Florida when I was two years old and on the runs from a juvenile facility. Not much to be proud of in my 38-year-old existence. But Klaudia told me that Americans don’t do much traveling, not compared to Europeans. Klaudia’s probably flying right now.

She flew all the way from Poland to see me. It’s one of the highlights of my life. And the stories she’d tell me of all the places she’d seen while in America it was amazing. She’s seen more of the country I’ve called home my whole life in three months than I ever had. She would tell me how beautiful the sunsets are in California, but they would be better if you were here, she’d say. Sometimes her words would kill me. So beautiful and yet so heartbreaking. Because honestly I would have rather been with her than anywhere else on earth and it just wasn’t as possible.

You see I’m a lifer. 155 years to life actually. Was it the distance, the flying, or the time that ended things? Perhaps I’ll never know. She taught me so much in such a short time. Three years goes by so fast. And somehow this last year without her seems like a dozen if you ask me. And maybe that’s what love is, time in slow motion. Well I have nineteen years before I qualify for elderly parole. I’ve been down fifteen. The time goes by so fast. I don’t know what planes can get me to Poland but I know the Latitude is 52˚N and the Longitude is 19˚E. That’s for Warsaw, Poland’s capital city. I have never flown out of America and it’s something I think about a great deal now. I want to see the world. But most of all I want to see Poland. I want to give back to Poland for what the Polish woman has given men, Hope.
