**"Simple Pleasures" by Janie Elliott**

With a beautiful sunset and a mother drake with little ones near by. After painting it I sent a card to go with it and these were the words I wrote...

To me

The best things in life are free

The sunset

The lake

The birds and

The drake

The peace of the morning

A fish without warning

The feel of a summer breeze

The sound as it blows in the trees.

The love that we share

The knowing you care

The best things in life are free.

They're the simple pleasures you see.
