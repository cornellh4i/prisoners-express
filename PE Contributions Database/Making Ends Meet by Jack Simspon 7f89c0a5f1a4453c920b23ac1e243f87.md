**Making Ends Meet by Jack Simspon**

Managing your money can make you or break a person. To eat out everyday or to buy things on an impulse will leave a person with nothing.

I will not lie, I have stocked up on food since this virus has hit. I’ve learned to tighten my belt, only if I had a belt. A cup of soup which costs fifty-nine cents becomes a healthy meal. Of course we get three meals a day. Some aren’t that bad.

My brother and sister have been very helpful to me. Around January I had a little money put in my accounts and still have some of it at this point. I spend what I really need. Most is on court papers. So far it has or hasn’t helped. I’m still here and really must hope this will be it.

Making ends meet from one month to the next is what everyone is doing on the streets. Unemployment is high, food banks are asking for help. Our local news tells us five dollars will feed twenty-five families a meal for a day. There sure couldn’t be much food in that bag -  if there is then sign me up! I will help with money.

Working in the yard or compound, it is according to how you look at it. We will have a small garden this year. Won’t be a lot, but things are looking up here. Since the area I work for is in the bottom of the list to get things fixed. Money is given to all areas. We work out in the sun all day. Even in the rain, cold, and snow. We can’t even get a nozzle for a garden hose. A less than six dollar item. It is like pulling hen's teeth (which hens don’t have.)

One thing I can say, making ends meet isn’t very hard for me. There are days I am just happy with a pack of toasted cheese crackers, or about ten saltine crackers. Our bodies need solid good food. I have eaten so much tuna that I dream of fish and the Ocean. We pay one dollar and eighty-three cents for less than four ounces of fish.

A cup of soup (shrimp) and the tuna with a little mayo goes a long way. It will make three healthy sandwiches. Of course, I drain the liquid off and some of it for mashed potatoes. No more than one day and you will have to throw out the liquid. It will turn sour.

I know that when you are in college or prison a budget is a thing that has to be controlled. Not everyone comes from a wealthy family. I work to have money to buy the important things. We all have to learn to do without.

Making ends meet has taught me that there are more important things in life than just putting food in my mouth. It is a way to learn and to pass it on to others, our future government, families, and the world needs to learn to tighten up. Save a little and eat for a better day. If not then we all will be holding a hand out for leftovers.
