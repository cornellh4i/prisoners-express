**A Way Out by Juan Delgado**

Life is a rough patch like a cave inside a rock; everything is claustrophobic. Sometimes we feel like we can’t catch a breath, and every inch of the surface we touch is rough, and as hard as a rock - like being trapped inside a cave, trying always to find a way out of situations that life throws our way. Whether it is a meeting we don’t want to attend or the rent is due, or the bills are piling up, or going to the in law’s house, or just looking at our own personal bank account, or nosy neighbors, or the loud barking dog down the street, or the boy or girl that likes us, but is too shy to say hi, or the stress from the day’s work, or the work to finish. The things to accomplish, the goals to meet seem too far away, but as time passes, we learn to maneuver our way out of things until we feel safe or get our courage back, always looking for the light at the end of the tunnel, the closer we get, the better we feel. Our stress goes down, and we feel more ready to accomplish and achieve, and even to appreciate ourselves and learn to share our time with everyone in our path once we find a way out of our entrapment.
