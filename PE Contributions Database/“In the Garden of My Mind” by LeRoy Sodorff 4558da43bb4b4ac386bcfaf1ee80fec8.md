**“In the Garden of My Mind” by LeRoy Sodorff**

Neath a sky-blue canopy in this garden of mine bringing to fruition avocado and lime; Winding then the maize in a field abloom a range of vibrant hues in the stillness loom; Coffee and cream, lots and lots, pumpkin and plum, oranges and apricots; Lilac and lavender, sage and saffron, dahils and daffodil, peach and citron; Myrtle and dogwood, tangerine and cherry, primrose and indigo, grape and strawberry; Sorrel and cinnamon, orchid and fuchsia, walnut and mahogany, poppy and petonid; No thistles or thorns, brier nor bor weeded out will ever endure; For every fall brings a new yield, a blessing or calamity but garner your crop without a thought of finality; Enrich your garden, remove the weeds, align the rows, and sow new seeds!
