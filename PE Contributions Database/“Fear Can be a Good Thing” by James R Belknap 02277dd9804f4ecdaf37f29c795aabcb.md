**“Fear Can be a Good Thing” by James R. Belknap**

A cool breeze blows across the water. Waves crash gently against the soft sand. I can taste the salt in the air. The distinct smell of the ocean assaults my nostrils. Gulls call out and drop from the sky.

Lounging in the end of day sun, I sit watching my six year old son, Steve, play in the surf. He chases a crab until he tuckers out, and upon returning to where I lay, he touches the three scar on my back and asks how I got them.

I’ve always felt honesty is the best policy with children. They always seem to find out the truth if you try to lie to them. So I proceed to tell him that I was shot after being robbed.

Steven gets this excited look and tells me that I’m very brave for not being afraid of those bad men. The look melts my heart because it conveys that he believes his dad is a superhero, a feeling that only a proud child can give a parent.

However, I tell him that I was very afraid. Fear filled my mind during the whole ordeal. Before I can finish trying to explain things to my son, his face fills with disappointment as though I just crushed him.

I pick Steven up and sit him on my lap, telling him that fear isn’t always a bad thing. It saved my life: if it wasn’t the driving force of fear, I wouldn’t be here with you today. I can tell he doesn’t understand. I know I’ve got my hands full trying to explain fear to him.

Knowing this is a great opportunity to teach my son a valuable lesson, I decide to tell him the whole story because maybe it will help him in the future. I’ve learned that fear isn’t a bad thing as long as you can overcome it and face it head on. “Daddy was very scared, Steven.” I could have lost my life, and there will be times in your life when you have to face your worst fears just as I did. He looks at me and asks why those bad men shot me. I tell him that some people try to use violence to get what they want. Here’s why your daddy was shot: I was working out of town doing construction work, and it was pay day, and I’d work six 12 hour shifts that week. I was ready for some fun to unwind.

I met this pretty girl at a bar, and after a few drinks, she asked if I’d like to take a walk. We headed toward the beach to find a secluded spot to watch the sunrise bring in the new day. Only minutes after we sat down, two men came out of the dark headed straight for us at a job. I realized one had a pistol in his hand.

When they arrived, fear filled my thoughts, but I didn’t let it paralyze me. I was trying to figure a way out of this situation, and then the man raised his pistol and put it near my face. He demanded my wallet and cell phone.

I tried to keep thinking and looking for a way out, and so I handed the two items over, trying to delay the outcome I was sure was coming. The woman, whose name I don’t even know, says, “Kevin, let’s go.” Kevin starts yelling because she said his name, and now my fear level reaches new heights. But I don’t freeze. I tried to jump out of the way, but I was still shot three times.

I can tell he still doesn’t understand what I’m trying to say. I tell him that fear worked in three different ways to save my life. First, it gave me the adrenaline rush to keep going. Second, Kevin’s fear of being caught made him run off before checking to see if I was dead. Lastly, the fear of never seeing you again gave me the strength to live. I had to alternate walking and crawling to get help. The fear of losing you gave me the will to keep on, and I found to see my son again.

Never let anyone tell you that fear is a negative emotion. The only time fear is a bad thing is when you let it overcome and paralyze you. There’s nothing wrong with being afraid, and it can be a valuable tool as long as you overcome your fears and face them head on.

Fear is actually good for you. It keeps your senses sharp and helps you find the drive to overcome it. Always respect fear and use it to your advantage. It will be a great asset in dealing with the struggles you will surely encounter over your life. It will help you overcome dangerous situations. It helps you give your undivided attention to your problems.

On the other hand, never lose the emotion of fear. Once this happens, you will make costly mistakes. A lack of fear will make you careless. It will cause you not to respect and give proper attention to dangers. You’ll be more likely to encounter tragedy and get hurt without some fear.

You see, son, fear is why I’m here now. Always control and overcome your fears: never give into it. Use it to your advantage, and you’ll have the upperhand in life.

The way a child can brighten your world still amazes me. The look of Steven on that day will be in my mind as long as I live. When he told me he was proud of his brave daddy, he melted my heart. To top the matter off, he told me he would never let fear overcome him and that he would tackle his troubles head on.

All in all, remember fear isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The difference between a coward and a brave man is being able to overcome your fears. My greatest fear was never seeing my son again, and that gave me the energy and fight to survive.
