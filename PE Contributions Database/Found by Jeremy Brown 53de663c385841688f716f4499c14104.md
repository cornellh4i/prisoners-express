**Found by Jeremy Brown**

My dad Donny and I were driving in the mountains of Northern California. It was cold. We pulled off on a shortcut. We were trying to get to Mount Shasta. Well, let me tell you we hit this road, and it never stopped. My dad finally said, “I think we might be lost.”

“Well, it’s too late to turn back. Keep going until we meet someone,” I said.

“You’re right, son.” We drove for what seemed like forever. We passed old gold mines and felled trees; the whole place just felt spooky. It was like nature just didn’t want humans to be there. You could feel the trees whispering. As a Cherokee native, my father taught me how to feel with my intuition, listen with my eyes, hear with my spirit, and see with my ears. Finally, we came to a small mining town’s gas station. It was old with number dials: no digital. It was like going back in time. Very cool. An old geezer found us and told us where to go. We finally made our way to Mount Shasta. Still, it was spooky.
