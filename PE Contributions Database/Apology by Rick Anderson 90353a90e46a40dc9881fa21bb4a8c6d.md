**“Apology” by Rick Anderson**

Webster defines apology: “an admission of error or discourtesy by an expression of regret.” I will admit that saying “I’m sorry” is not as easy as it sounds. Saying it and meaning it are two separate things. I can say it from my head and say at the same time “yeah right”. Or I can say it from my heart and mean it and prove it in my actions from then on. Saying it is just words. Saying and proving it involves action on my part to prove that I sincerely mean it.

I’ve also heard that saying I’m sorry is not an act of weakness, but an act of strength and courage.

Over the years, I’ve had many opportunities to apologize for my words and/or my actions. There were many times that it came from my head and I just went on doing whatever it was. It had no meaning to me nor were there any feelings or emotions involved. It was just 2 words in my vocabulary. Whomever was the recipient of those words, be it family, friends, co-workers, etc knew that it was just words I spoke to appease them for the time being. They waited until I committed the same act again knowing again they’d hear those 2 words that meant nothing.

Since I’ve been involved in a 12 step recovery program for over 30 years, I’ve learned to apologize with feeling and regret and learned the actions I needed to connect the problem. The main problem was me! I had to apologize and make amends to a lot of people for my past and the things that I said or did to harm them, physically, mentally, or emotionally. I still have a long way to go, but I’m getting there. I’ve learned that personally it is better (and sometimes harder) to apologize face-to-face. “The eyes are the windows to your soul”. I believe that and if the other person can see my face and look into my eyes, they’ll see that I am serious and feel the remorse or regret for my actions or words.

I’ve had to apologize to my family (parents, siblings) for words or actions that I did or said while growing up together and even after I left the house. They might not have been the direct recipient of the issue, but they are the victims of my actions as what I say or do affects all of them one way or the other. The biggest issue that this pertains to now is my crimes that I committed to put me here in prison. The actual crime did not involve them, but the after effects did. Their son/brother/uncle/cousin is now in prison. Their father is a sex offender. Did I think about them as I downloaded the child porm? Was I worried about what they might say if they knew? The answer to both of those questions is a resounding No! Do I care how they feel now that I’m locked up doing time for my actions? Yes I do.

I am apologizing to them every day. But this time my actions are proving that the apologies are meant with feeling. I am working on my main problem, me!, by working the 12 steps of recovery for all my addictions. I am putting God into my life more and more every day. I am accepting responsibility for all my actions in the past to today. My journal is entitled “It’s Not All About Me!” And that is so true today.

Today it is easy to say those 2 words, I’m sorry, and put into action what needs to be done to fix my situation. When I get up in the morning, I pray to God for the strength to do his will and for him to guide me on the right path.

I always have to remember that the first apology I have to make to Him and ask for His forgiveness. Only then can I forgive myself and be strong enough to apologize to those I’ve hurt. It’s not easy, but it’s what needs to be done if I want to be a better me for all concerned.

As I sit here writing this, more apologies need to be made to people that mean a lot to me. Starting with my 11 year old daughter (who is without her dad for 4 years) to my parents. Some of the apologies are for minor issues and some not so minor. Unfortunately as I’m so far from home at the moment, I can’t make face-to-face apologies.

When my older kids were toddlers, and they did something wrong, I didn’t yell, I didn’t spank. I would sit on the floor with them, at their level, and we’d talk about what they did wrong, and I’d explain why what they did was wrong. Then they’d apologize to whoever they needed to and do the actions required to prove the response. It took a while for me to learn to practice what I preach. I have friends and a Chaplain here that can talk to me on my level and help me to apologize when needed and the actions needed to prove my sincerity.

Apologizing is a sign of strength - not weakness. Be strong and say I’m sorry for… then prove it by your actions.
