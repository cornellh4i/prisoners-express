**“My Last Move” by Jack Simpson**

The day I moved out on my own, I was just turning eighteen. Single and looking for adventure in a large city. I had visited large cities when I was young with my parents. I have always loved New York and how the people are so in such a rush.

A friend of mine had left at my age and was now working for a large law firm in the city. She had studied on the side to be a paralegal. I had figured if she could make it so could I. Headstrong and with a lot of determination. I knew it could as well be my turn.

I was in my third month and could only find low paying jobs. This was not going to cut it. My meals had become small and few. If things didn’t make a change, I would have to find a better way to pay my bills.

I contacted Anita and to see if she could help or give some advice. She really couldn’t promise me anything, she did say she would check around and make a few phone calls.

“Give me a day or two and I let you know,” she said.

Then the phone went silent. She could be my last hope. It was Friday the 13th. In no way am I superstitious, after hearing all the negative people who believe. One has to think outside the box.

Monday morning I got up and had a coke and a honeybun. Not much of a breakfast, money was tight, my savings were getting low. Once it is all gone, I’d be out on the street or on my way back home as a failure.

Sitting on the window box looking over the city, I was wondering how many others had the same problem. They would have to leave everything behind and return to the places they had come from. How many kids were involved with their choices?

My heart had become heavy and I sure didn’t want to return home. I wanted more to prove to myself and others this was my dream. I would love to have my life to be fulfilled with all I have ever wanted.

I was watching the clouds float by. They reminded me of cotton balls. They were so close you just wanted to reach out and grab one. The constant noise of sirens traveled up to the seventh floor. The building had a total of twenty-two floors. Not included in this was the penthouse. It was owned by a couple, I had never seen before. They had their own private elevator.

The phone rang, it was on its third ring by the time I held the receiver. “Hello,” I said. It was Anita. “Wanda, I have good news for you,” she said. I listened as she told me about the new job. “My boss is willing to hire you as an intern, you will start this Thursday.” “What will I wear to the job?” I asked. “Come by to the office and I will have a voucher for you to pick up some clothes.” “Ok, I will be there within the hour. I hung up the phone feeling secure this was going to be my home.

It has been two years now since Anita helped me get the job with this law firm. So far I have worked my way up the ladder as they call it. This woman has left the internship behind and has studied real hard for the paralegal course. I passed the exam for it and will be working on getting my law degree soon. It takes a little effort to get things done in life you don’t give up. Believing in yourself and putting time into it will always be rewarding in the end.

Now that Hamilton, Snyder, and Associates believe in me, I could very well see my name on the door also. This is one of the largest law firms in the state.

I really can say that I have a place of my own, closet full of clothes, shoes, bills paid, and money in savings. Most of all, this is my last move.
