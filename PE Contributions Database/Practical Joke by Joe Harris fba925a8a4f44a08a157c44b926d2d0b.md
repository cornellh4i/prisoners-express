**"Practical Joke"** **by Joe Harris**

As a kid, I was always told to “be a man”.

But no one had a clear idea of what that means.

As I got older, I was still being told to “be a man”.

They started coming up with ideas, each on conflicting with another.

As I became an adult there were more telling me to “be a man”.

They even fought and argued about what this meant, among themselves.

When I finally figured out for myself, what it means to “be a man”,

I, then, realized that I should have stayed a kid.
