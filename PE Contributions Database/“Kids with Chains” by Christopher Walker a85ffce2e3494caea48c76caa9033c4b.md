**“A Freakshow Called Life”**

**“Kids with Chains” by Christopher Walker**

I sit here in my cage 20 years later looking at a picture of me and my brother Cy. I see us there in our hand-me-down tights, the ones from the Trapeze Artist’s Children. I remember how I preferred them to the Midget Clown’s old shirts we originally had. I was so grateful to have something to cover my rough and discolored shin and Cy stopped itching from his polkadot wool shirt.

“Ty and Cy the troll twins” is what people called us. The Others would say that I was the only troll while my brother was a cyclops, which I didn’t understand back then. We were a part of the “Greatest Show on Earth” according to our ringmaster and Owner. He would also say that even though we weren’t Merrick we still made him a mint, which I never understand. The people in the crown usually said the worst things ever thought, but I try not to think about that anymore. Except the screams, I still hear them in my dreams sometimes.

I look at Cy, all bent over and I know I did the right thing. When they let us out of our cage the others asked that we covered our faces. That made it even harder to Cy to breathe with his messed up mouth and flat nose. We had to cover his eye when we went for walks because if he saw something move he wanted to chase it. After Cy bit the Strangeman the Owner chained us together and said if I wanted out I had to watch after my brother. So I took care of my brother as best I could.

Over time, the Others warmed up to me, but never to Cy. The Bearded Lady taught me how to read and write, but Cy couldn’t even talk let alone understand letters. The Clowns would give me books and toys to pass the time. The toys were usually broken the first time Cy got ahold of them so he wasn’t allowed to touch the books. The Other’s kids would sit outside our cage each night while I read to them and Cy until he fell asleep. Even though I was in the cage I still felt like a part of the Others.

As the years passed and we grew older things got easier for me and harder for Cy. He kept getting sick and his eye would swell shut for days. I could tell that he was in constant pain from his sinuses when he would pull on his ears and hold his head. During the night he would wake up choking and gasping because he had rolled onto his back in his sleep. If we had a mean crowd then he would whimper and cry in his sleep ‘til he woke up screaming and howling.

They say “Man inspires literature and literature inspires man” and I fully believe that. I have been The Creatures that Mary Shelly wrote of. I have experienced the fear and paranoia of “Crime and Punishment,” and understand the mercies of George when it came to Lenny. So reenacting the part of that great Indian in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” I set my brother free. So, I sit here in my cage 20 years later looking at a picture of me and my brother Cy.
