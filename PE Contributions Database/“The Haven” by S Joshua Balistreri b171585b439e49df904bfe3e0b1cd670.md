**“The Haven” by S. Joshua Balistreri**

****The heat of the sun baking off of the desert sand is almost to the point of being unbearable. Yet, for the last three days, we’ve marched through this Godforsaken shithole nonstop. Until this morning, that is. That’s when they attacked.

Old Squiggy and I were camped out on the northeast side of one of the big dunes out here, preparing to strike camp and make our final push toward the haven. We were not alone: with us, there were four others, making six in our party. Of course, Squiggy isn’t his real name. I don’t know what his name is, and so I gave him one. We are not friends. Quite the opposite.

You see, Squiggy and his friends were my escorts, and I, their prisoner. I am wanted by some pretty nasty individuals in the Haven. Squiggy and his friends happened to be the lucky ones who captured me and were to collect the bounty--until they were attacked by Dwellers that is, anyway.

Personally, for me, it couldn’t have been a better stroke of luck. During the struggle, three of the bounty hunters were killed fighting Dwellers. In the battle that ensued, more Dwellers had been killed, thereby leveling the playing field. Another bounty hunter was severely wounded, and in the chaos of the fight, I managed to knock out Squiggy and get free of my restraints. Weapon in hand, I shot two more Dwellers, and the rest of the Dwellers decided that we were no longer worth it and ran away. I walked up to the screaming injured bounty hunter and ended his misery.

Now, you may ask why, since I was free of my captors, am I carrying Old Squiggy and still heading toward the Haven? Simple. Getting captured was part of my plan and my only way into the Haven. So I’m not done with him yet. Only now, I have to carry this sack of shit.

One way or the other, he is going to get me into the Haven. And may whatever God there is help those sons of bitches when I do!
