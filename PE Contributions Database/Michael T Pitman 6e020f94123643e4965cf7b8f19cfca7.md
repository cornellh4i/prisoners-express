**by Michael T. Pitman**

My first real job, with benefits such as paid vacation and sick days, was when I was 13-14 years old. There weren’t child labor laws then besides not working late on school nights. I was a houseman for an upscale hotel in New York State and worked full-time all year around, even while school was in session, in the housekeeping department performing various tasks such as restocking the linen closets, distributing chemical cleaning supplies, cleaning the laundry shoot, and even setting tables and chairs for meetings and conferences.

After a couple of years, I was made the head houseman of the housemen, with several off-duty GIs/soldiers from the nearby army base as my crew. We worked for the “executive housekeeper” (and don’t you dare lessen her title, it was *executive*!), a lady by the name of Miss Quinlin, although her husband had been the proprietor of an old fashion travelling medicine show, selling “Magic Elixirs” to cure whatever ails you. She was old-fashioned in her thinking, but I didn’t realize how badly.

I had been the head houseman for quite a while when on one pay day, I discovered that my crew of part-time GI workers were being paid a nickel an hour more than I was, despite my added responsibilities, length of employment, and dedication to doing a good job. I took serious offence to this inequality in pay since the GIs had to be trained by me every time one of them left, which was often. It was just a part time job for them.

I asked Miss Q about this slight in my pay and requested to at least be paid the same as the others and was astonished in her reply: no! She reasoned that since I was full-time and unmarried, unlike them, I made more and didn’t “need as much.” No amount of common sense reasoning would change her mind, and so I gave her my two weeks notice and secured another position with more money and opportunity at a nearby inn.

On my last day, Miss Q changed her mind and offered a raise: “I’ll pay you a quarter more.” I laughed and left!

A nickel doesn’t buy much, but it sure meant a lot!
