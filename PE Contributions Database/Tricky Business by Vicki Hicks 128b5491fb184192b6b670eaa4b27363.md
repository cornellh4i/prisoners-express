**Tricky Business by Vicki Hicks**

My oldest daughter was born on October 28th and the town we lived in always held trick-or-treating on the last Saturday of October, so naturally her birthday parties always fell on that night. My husband goes all out for Halloween. Our house is decorated with cobwebs, black lights, and a smoke machine. He even sits in a chair dressed in all black with a black cape, a scary green mask with sharp teeth and holds the candy bowl as he sits very still. When the children grab candy, he moves to scare them.

I am the scaredy cat; my own shadow scares me. On our daughter’s 8th birthday we had a Halloween party for her and got everyone in the trailer on the back of the golf cart to go trick-or-treating. The last street in the neighborhood was very dark and as the girls walked up to a house; right out of the ground a man covered in leaves sat up, stood and walked up behind the girls. This man was dressed up in a blue jumpsuit with a hockey mask on and big heavy black work boots. You guessed it, Jason from Friday the 13th complete with a chainsaw.

It frightened the girls and myself so much that we jumped on the golf cart and left everyone else there to walk home. Back at the house we were sitting on the front porch and at the corner I saw a vehicle stop and none other than Jason got out and began to walk over to our house. The girls and I ran inside slamming and locking all windows and doors; screaming all the way to my room. One of the mothers knocked on my window to make sure everyone was ok and I went to the window and peeked out the blinds and there Jason was, trying to get In the window. Not only did I get bit on the shoulder by the little four year old bumble bee I was holding, but she pissed all down my side as well. I guess the expression “you scared the piss out of me” is true because not only did she piss on me, I pissed myself as well. After a shower my husband told me that he went and asked Jason to make a visit to our house and crash the party. I have to say that was the best birthday party ever.

Trick-or Treat from Jason!
