**“Heaven Sends The Cure Before The Disease” by Robert Clayton**

When I was little, my granny and poppa used to take me fishing in the Sulfur River, Mount Pleasant, in the monument.

Before we would set out, she would make us all take two sulfur tablets because the mosquitoes were so terrible there, they would eat you alive. Especially the kids. They can somehow sense younger blood.

Mosquitoes within the tree-lines would not, and could not, transfer diseases though. And that had to do with a number of variables. Just as moss works only when certain other things line up. But regardless, the sulfur tablets made us smell awful.

I told you this so that you might be saved from the pestilence. That shall come to be near us all because we’ve violated the commands of the law. You see, it tells you in the forty-ninth chapter of Exodus, that you should not take any unclean animal out of their habitat. Not eating them was a precursor.

All those unclean species within Leviticus Eleven weren’t supposed to be taken from their home. Because they clean our Earth for us. Taking within themselves every bad-negative thing. Then it becomes a CANCER when it metamorphosizes into their meat. But the truth in the fact only comes when it dies. For that wastefulness does not return. No, never again does it contaminate. That, due to the fact of what comes to get it.

Please be kind enough to at least consider. Our swamps clean our fresh water, but when you come to see a swamp looking healthy, that means it is dying. Ours is dying because of overfishing.

A swamp is supposed to look like the gloom, smell like the unbathed, taste like terrible, and cause you to feel like the greatest of depression. But, today's do none of these. Because we are stealing all of the crawdads. Now, the moss is dying.

My granny and poppa says to me when I was still itty-bitty, “The Bible was never supposed to be changed, but they did it anyway.” I didn’t know it then, but it’s due to the fact that there was not any light left in them.

The cure must always come before the disease. So please be so very kind as to at least try me. As silver is the hardest to refine. Do not take any unclean animal out of its habitat. Leave it be. Just because it is already out does not mean you should go ahead and purchase it either. Nor eat it within another’s home or place of business either. Check also, all usable products, to see if anything unclean is within it. That you will not use that at all. But be mindful that tricky laws are in place so they may still be labeled as kosher in varying ways.

Now, take this just as seriously--for the sake of your children. Please, keep yourselves cold at all costs. A mosquito hates the cold because of what it does to the blood. Don’t put pesticides in your yard, never ever again. They kill the bugs that eat the mosquitoes. Have a male start your cars. Be sure to have him stay in it until it gets cold. But never open the sunroof, nor let the top down. Especially, if the windows are down, due to the fact that the air conditioning doesn’t work. Don’t use an outside vent in place of cold air, never.

Also be sure to fully submerge yourself in ice water once a week (your entire body because it shocks your system by training it to look out for danger); do not ever put any bug repellant on yourselves (it contains sugars that attract mosquitoes to you as well as a chemical component that keeps a few of the others from working together); put bug zappers on the sides- one about three steps from the front on the right the other one three steps from the back on the left of your home, put brass windchimes on a hanger at your front and back door because they call to the good insects, and spread sulfur in your yard once or twice a week.

Please be so kind as to keep listening. That you will not send anyone else to Brazil. For the Olympics, I mean. Because that’s where the hive is. Even though it is not the source. You would have to go to Asia for that, by way of Nepal. Yakuza, just as Triads are putting dangerous chemicals into the plants to cause them to burn poison emissions. Or, Crimean Mafias are sending Nuclear waste into certain parts of our sea. Because they know our groundwater comes from the ocean pushing itself through the Earth.

Our fracking is destroying us as well. Because we refill all the gaps with mud and this and that. But that water must pass-in every bit of humility and sincerity I say this- through those gases to carry on the natural selection cleaning process of our groundwater. As all elements live harmoniously within one another once you reach a certain depth. Just as if you go down to a certain level within the ocean you will implode, but if you keep on you will explode. (A specific type of weight with a sensor within will teach you this, if only you add a few cracks)

The currents in water change at various depths because it's our true source of gravity. It literally makes us spin. And just as the waters above teach us- PLANKTON- the source of eternal life- is far too important to let slip away by way of any contaminations whatsoever.like allowing any country-like the entire continent of South America to use DDT pesticide- destruction rights. We need plankton more than all life. Including ourselves.

Eff is the only pesticide you need for the vine. Just as you truly should allow ivy to grow around your fence line because it attracts both bees and ants.(the farmer’s guardian and secret protector.) Please know though, if you place an egg by a tree, you must do so on three- I will leave it to you to figure out- sides onl. And, a bush, none.

They’re not here to trickle down aid on us anymore you know. All of the governments of this, our world. There is no exception to what I say. We know this is the truth based on the fact that each race’s leaders are promoting racism now more than ever. As divine intervention only comes by way of those who do not: look, think, act, or even profess faith as you do. Can you believe this even though you know for certain I have always been poor?

Moses (Moshe) is a mitzrite name. In mitzrayim, all the firstborn of the Hebrew livestock- and mixed multitude which included white slaves-did not die.Pharoah’s daughter to the sister of Moses, named Misiam, she would pay wages to her mother for caring for him. Now please, read from now on for a reason of. Not: reasoning, purpose, way-of-life. For that is what we ourselves must give scripture.

Slaves do not get paid. Mixed peoples were created to be servants. Even still, they have the time. So he allowed them animals as well. For: milk, cheese, and butter. They were not though, allowed to eat meat, not eat animals in any shape, form or fashion. Controlling this law keeping butchering connected to the temples. So the lamb’s blood couldn’t have been the protector. Ask my cousin Ivy because I don’t comprehend black egyptian folklore. But I do know that no person’s race as a whole has never worked up a sweat unpaid. Not since the silver win was invented.

You must look within, or the pestilence will remain. The: white lies to white, black to black, red to red, yellow to yellow. Redeem your firstborn by having them save the speckled gray. As your women save all swamplands. And children, unclean. Oh yeah, they don’t yet know how to clean Nuclear waste from seas nor Lyme from air.
