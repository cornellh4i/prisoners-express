**Bargains and their Hidden Cost by Marvin C Jones**

1985: As Emma sleeps blissfully, her mother moves about the house like a tornado: she is looking for her coupon book, today is shopping day, a day she lives for, catching all the bargains she can afford.

Finally! She yells excitedly after locating her coupon book between the cushions of her favorite old chair.

“Emma!” she yells, “Emma baby get up, I need you tuh takes me to duh sto’s across town…”

When she gets no response she goes down the hallway and knocks on Emma’s door.

“Emma? Baby you up in nare?”

Emma, startled out of her sleep by the pounding on her door sits bolt upright.

“What’s going on momma?” she yells at the door.

“I need you tuh takes yo momma tu duh sto’s befo’ they gets crowd’d!”

“Okay momma, I need to jump in the shower first and have a cup of coffee.”

“I’ll makes you some coffee.” her mother responds.

Emma loves her mother but sometimes she just wishes she had her own place. Out loud, Emma says “I’m so sick of driving her all over town for these stupid bargains, all she do is penny pinch, all my life she says “let’s go catch these bargains.” She should have gone to school instead of chasing bargains, walking around here talking like a slave, so embarrassing.”

Emma opens her door to head to the bathroom and stops in her tracks, startled to see her mother standing there with a steaming cup of coffee and tears in her eyes. Without reaching for the coffee Emma asks, “Momma what’s wrong?”

“You wanna know wha’s wrong baby? Let me tell you wha’s wrong…” With trembling hands, she places the cup of coffee into her daughter’s hands. “Eva since you wassa baby I swore you would neva want nuffin’. I was 13 when yo daddy found out I was pregnant and took off. I had no family, no place to go, strangers givin’ me a few dollas here and there to clean they stinky clothes and smelly houses. I saved every dime and lived unda a bridge fo a long time until ole Ms. Mack took me in one day, she was blind and so ole she could hardly walk, but she taught me how precious a bargain was. This was how I was able to put food in yo mouth and clothes on ya back, thanks to what she taught me. I learned to save enough money to put you through school and keep a roof over ya head.”

“So you see, my darlin’ Emma, I gave all I had for you, an I’s talks..like dis...so you wouldn’t...hafto…

“I’s chase bargains because bargains saved our lives!”
