Growing up, I did not have a nickname until I got to high school. I had several credit cards in my name, while almost nobody else had even one credit card. One girl in my freshman class started calling me Money Stacks and it stuck. Everyone would call me Money Stacks, including some of the teachers.

Everywhere we would go I would usually pull out one of my American Express cards. My favorite was my American Express Platinum charge card with no pre-set limit. Sometimes we would be at restaurants where the waitstaff would seem somewhat indifferent toward us students. Usually one of my friends would say, “Money Stacks, pull out your Platinum Card.” When the waitstaff saw that my complete name matched on both my driver’s license and Platinum Card, they would treat us a whole lot better than another patron of a great tip.

We often took school trips out of town. At school I got plenty of attention from the girls but got lots more attention on school trips. The girls always called me Money Stacks. With some work on their part they would usually be able to persuade me to buy them things. There were plenty of times that the girls would tell me the boys were envious of me getting so much attention from all the girls. I found that odd, since the boys did not ever mention anything. Yet I could believe it, since girl after girl mentioned it. I did drive a brand new Cadillac while most of the other guys had no car. They rode the school bus or got dropped off by their parents at school.
