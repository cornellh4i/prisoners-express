**Debts by Bernard Wroblewski**

When we hear the word “debt” we tend to think about monetary value. Being in debt to the bank. To a friend. A car company. To the credit union or such. It’s always money.

But let’s step away from the money and material things. Step outside the normal thoughts of debts.

I speak of debts that we cannot possibly repay. Or maybe we can. At least we’ll strive to the old promise “I’ll make it up to you.” We all individually owe our parents debts. Debts of love, patience, security, and knowledge. So much they gave us so much so they taught us and out on the line for us. Just because we may have a nuclear fallout with one or both of our parents. It doesn’t exempt that debt. We owe them all those debts. To be patient and understanding, to be forgiving and compassionate. To give all that we have in support. We owe them honor and respect. And they are allowed to have lapses. To fall. To fail. To stumble and break. And our debt to them is to be there through every moment of it. For our parents and grandparents. Remember you are a wayward child. And they stuck it out for you. They loved you and forgave you. And they still do. Also we owe debts to ALL the First Responders who go above and beyond the call of duty to help us. To come running when we cry out. To ALL THE SOLDIERS who have fought for this country, for you and me. Who put their lives in jeopardy so we’ll stay safe and free.

To ALL the teachers, the foster parents, the men and women who work in children’s homes. Teaching, loving, protecting. Standing and fighting for the children who the world has forgotten.

And parents, you have debts to your CHILDREN! If you decide to copulate and have children, you owe it to them to love them every moment, to put their needs and safety above your addictions and fads. You owe them love, affection, honesty, attention, and adoration. After all, children don’t just fall out of trees into your arms.

Finally, and most importantly, above everything else. If you are a Believer of Christ. If you know who He is. We owe Him debts we will never be able to repay. For Him laying down His life for us, so we can be saved. So we can know God’s Mercy, we can know Grace, Forgiveness and Eternal Life. And we owe God for the audacity to ask such a price of His only son. How painful that must be. How sorrowful. And what’s crazy, what’s so awesome. They don’t ask for much. Just to love them, to accept them, to speak to them as a Father and a friend. And to introduce them to other people, and show our neighbors. The Love, the Compasion, Mercy, Grace, and Forgiveness They have given us.

And just imagine whether you’re a Christian or not. If you believe in Jesus Christ or not. If we were all to humble ourselves enough. Be brave enough to read how he loved and helped others. Without judgement, without price. Without reprisal to those who would harm Him. If we could walk like that. Live like that. Love like that. How much more peace we could know!! He is The Prince of Peace after all. So when you consider DEBTS, stop and think of all that we really owe, and maybe we’ll learn to be more thankful.
