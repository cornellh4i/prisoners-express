**A New Path by Hunter Widner**

Alone and scared, I thought back to the boast I had made about being able to find myself a new trail. I had marked each tree as I passed by so in case I chickened out, I could turn and run back. There seemed to be a slight problem now, all the trees bear the mark. On trembling knees, I fell to the ground as I began to weep.

As the tears fell, I asked the ground if it would send some help, though in my mind I knew it would not answer my plea. Punching the ground as hard as I could, I felt like giving up which was something I rarely did. As I let out another cry of anguish something caught my attention.

The sound of footsteps shuffling with a cane drew near. Drying my face so the person wouldn’t see my sudden lack of machismo. As I looked up to see an elderly woman making her way to where I was, I felt devastated for she had followed me.

“Son, would you like to take a stroll with me?” The woman’s voice was soft. “I am in need of some company.”

Nodding as I stood to brush myself off, I couldn’t help but wonder who this woman was or how long she had been walking. Talking step for step with the woman seemed like an adventure all on its own. She told me stories of the Great Depression and raising eight kids while working on a farm. Somehow I felt like I knew her, but where or how I didn’t know. Before I could ask her for her name, I saw light coming from the trees. In what seemed like several hours, but was only one, we had carved a new path back to the start of the trail. As I realized the identity of the woman she had disappeared with a blink of an eye. Making it back out with a smile for the Lord God sent my great grandmother to not only keep me company, but to show that He cares and will show a way out of any problem.
