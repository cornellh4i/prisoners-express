**“Some Things Bloom” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

“Then help me understand,” his voice breaking. She looked at him. Hands out, palms up; tie loose and sloppy; sleeves half up, half down; rebellious hair and long faced. Eight years of marriage, two wonderful children, a decent marriage, and everything most women would kill for. She hugged herself, eyes downcast. Sunlight pouring into their bedroom.

“I can’t,” a small voice.

“What about me? The kids?” Accusations harsh as cobra venom. Aghast, she met his bemused eyes.

“I love our children.”

“And me?” He was left looking at a familiar profile. “And me?” echoing in the gulf between them.

“He left me,” she said through the telephone receiver.

“I won’t,” strength vibrated from him. Solid, certain, fearless. Fierce. She touched the 2-inch shatter-proof glass separating them. Only cold greeted her when he responded.

“Time’s up, bud,” announced the prison guard.

“We’ll make it through this,” he said through the telephone.

“I love you,” tears threaten.

“I don’t deserve it.”

Once home in her apartment, she read his latest letters. Smelling lavender orchids, her tears blossomed.

“Nobody wants to see anyone get hurt,” he pleaded. “Not today…”

“Speak for yourself.”

“Ah, f---!” he thought, “It’s gonna be another long day. S---!”

“Alright, have it your way.” Throwing his hands up, he gave the order. “Sometimes you just can’t reason with these animals,” he thought.

“On three,” commanded the entry squad’s team lead. On three six helmeted, camo-suited, rowdy, gung-ho correctional officers rushed through the prisoner’s barricade. Entering the darkened cell, his domain.

“Offender, you are being charged with a rule one dash one, on attempted one dash one, four, one dash fives, and another one dash eight violation. How do you plead?”

Silence. A small grin.

“Answer me!” Roared the Warden. “Do you think the murder of my officers is funny? You think this is a f---ing joke?!”

“Well,” he began, “I was considering a very serious matter ju-”

Suddenly, the Warden was breath-stinking close. Cords straining in his neck.

“What in the hell is more important in that pea-brain of yours than my dead and wounded officers?!”

Blink. Blink again. A smile tugged his lips. Pleasantly he replied “I was wondering if I’d get the bean-patty or tofu loaf for lunch…”

“You can’t speak to the WARDEN like that,” an officer said. It’d taken four guards to restrain their boss. Uncuffed now in his new coffin. The prisoner turned around, shackles jingling.

“Well, he shouldn’t ask stupid questions.” Unbelievable. Who would’ve thought a prisoner, a criminal, would have such nerve? Didn’t he know he was less than human? A number on a file? An item on a list of things? An object?

“You’re nuts, guy,” another guard half-chuckled. A curtain rose from the prisoner’s face. Frost covered rage blended his eyes. Pupils and irises becoming one devouring abyss. A jaguar would’ve seemed more humane. Insane he wasn’t, far from it in fact. He was too intelligent and methodical, too dissembling to be crazy. Dangerous, though… he was that indeed.

An officer watched him sit at his concrete desk, tofu loaf dismissed. A bottle of lavender oil. Sheets of dark and royal blue paper. A half formed origami flower. A week’s worth of letters and flowers awaiting mail call to be sent out into the world.

Tears blurred his words, running the ink. Her apartment. Dark, save a single lamp. Six weeks since their last visit. Now, there’d be none. They’d buried him under the prison. No sunlight. No human contact. Only books and mail that he’d written. Curled on her sofa, rocking, she clutched his letters and flowers. Kissing his words, ‘Love always, A Villain.’

“I do love you,” she sighed.

“Hey uh…” she hesitated, “uh, what kinda flowers are those?”

Amused, he stared over a shoulder at the new guard. Finally, he smiled, “they’re orchids.”
