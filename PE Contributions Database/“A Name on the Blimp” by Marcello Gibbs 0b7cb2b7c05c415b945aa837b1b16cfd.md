**“A Name on the Blimp” by Marcello Gibbs**

Like Scar Face in the movie, he has a statue that said, “The world is yours.” Can you imagine having your name on a blimp? Wouldn’t that make you feel like the world is yours? It would show ownership, and as it flies across and around the world, everyone would see because it’s flying high everywhere with your name on it. I personally wouldn’t mind having my name on a blimp, because that’s like me being royal or something. No doubt, everyone would look once they see it floating high in the sky. They would look on with curiosity and definitely remember the name, because everybody will be talking about it. If you’re a businessman like me, you could put a brand or a business name on it and promote the name across the world. Either way, people will see the name on the blimp.
