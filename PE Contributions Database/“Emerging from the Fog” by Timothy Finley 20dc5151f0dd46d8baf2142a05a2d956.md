**“Emerging from the Fog” by Timothy Finley**

****It’s funny how our government will tell you our nation is founded on democracy and our Constitution, and how it sets us apart as being the greatest country in the world. So today I intend to contradict the government.

Now I could spend days dissecting the Constitution one amendment at a time, but I’ll focus solely on the Fourteenth Amendment. This amendment is predicated on equal protection of laws and the right to be free from discrimination. So I ask all the ladies reading this… do you feel like you’re receiving the full protections of this amendment?

Going back through the history of almost all governmental declarations, they read things like “all men were created equal,” words like brotherhood, him and he, but not once have I ever read “men and women were created equal,” or her or she when it comes to addressing our nation. Nothing in the Declaration of Independence, Declaration of Human Rights, or “we the people” comes close to whispering equality. The government’s tune is fraudulent. Men of the world, not just this country, need to ask themselves: where would we be without a woman?

Fellas, it’s time to show these women respect, if they’re showing they respect themselves. We need to acknowledge their intelligence first and then their physical beauty. Not to mention they’re tough as nails. You think you’re tough, try pushing a baby out of your body and enduring such pain. Ladies, you got my vote.

We tend to judge women on two fronts: emotions and sexual exploitation. We believe that because they’re overly emotional they make irrational decisions. We only think this because as men we are not commonly wired with emotions so when you’re not equipped with something you lack understanding of it, and this leads us to judgment. Emotions are what make you human and separate us from the wildlife.

Also, maybe you’ve been wronged by a woman before, or seen it happen. Don’t let a few faltering incidents set the tone for your reception of women as a whole. “Judge as you want to be judged.” Because if you’re being honest and fair, then you should take no offense if a woman judges you on the actions of, say, a “Harvey Weinstein.” Would you rather be known as an emotional or a sexual predator? Me, personally, I’m going to get started on crying a river.

Harvey Weinstein… this name is why I find myself participating in this theme. To me, “emerging from the fog” means women are finally getting recognition publically for what’s been happening since Eve stepped out of the garden. The “me, too” movement is just the beginning. But I think there needs to be more, we need to be tracking more than just celebrity profiles. What about those that aren’t being heard? There needs to be a network channel based strictly on sexual harassment, assaults and abuse. Sex offenders being broadcast, support groups on the network, issues on trafficking. The tracking of a criminal and civil cases, a wanted list, etc. Maybe Ellen could start a network like Oprah started her own.

Until this issue is tackled as a whole with 24/7 coverage, these issues will continue to exist. It’s going to take a collective group. And ladies, don’t be scared to lose your job or promotion. Stand up for yourself, keep the momentum going. Also, ladies, don’t take offense but some of you need to quit adding fuel to the fire with the voluntary prostitution, porn, stripping, exposing your bodies. All these things plant seeds of preexisting fantasies, which plays a role in how men operate sexually. You must limit that arousal so that you’re not putting yourself at risk.

The bottom line is “you” have to change men’s perception and until that’s done it’s a perpetual vicious cycle. Now I understand that some or a lot of the times an assault will occur that can’t be stopped because of force. There’s only one answer to those types of men, and it’s called a firing squad! So focus on the things you do have control over and “emerge from the fog”...
