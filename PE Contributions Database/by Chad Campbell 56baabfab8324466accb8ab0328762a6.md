When life gives you lemons make lemonade. Yeah but you still need sugar and water and other stuff. But that’s not the point and thats problem. That saying, repeated so many times , is about optimism. It means doing something to make life better instead moping.. I’ve met so many people that have just given up on living. I mean I struggle with depression, some days are better than others, but I keep going. I got sentenced to 16 years 8 months at 85, I was fuck up for a little bit of it, but now I am 9 years in with 4 and some change left because I decided to change myself for teh better and on my terms well mostly my terms. We also can get these things called milestones that give us time off of our sentence for doing things like college course, obtaining a GED or going to substance abuse classes. I can’t believe how people in here won’t take advantage of this shit. I mean a free education, a chance to become something more ad time off your sentence for doing it what are you thinking? I started taking college classes as soon as I found out they were free even before milestones, same with NA. Defeatism, they think there is no escaping the clutches of this system. well , good news, you can, all you have to do is want it. I home that people caught in this system will find a way to rise above this pace. There is people trying to put an end to mass incarceration and it’s time we do our part to crussh the prisons industrial complex.
