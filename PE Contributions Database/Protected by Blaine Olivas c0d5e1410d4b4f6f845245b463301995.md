**Protected By Blaine Olivas**

The night is cold and dark, the moist air chills my heart as it beats against the quiet light seeping into the caged windows. The pale moon glowing at the edges, soothes the sorrow that has threatened my heart. Its compassion for love, for you. Seeing you in my mind glowing from the sunlight cradling the leaves and rolling through the hills of our ways. Closing my eyes to savor the warmth we shared as we experienced one another in a smile, a shy gaze, or even a stern look. All is a dream now, but knowing that you are still there, I feel protected.

We made it! Your magic, my values, your principles, my ethics- we danced in the twilight at the whims of Respect and Responsibility. We cross over to a new day. Side by side, together, united in the life we live. It has been 13 years, 10 months, and 29 days since our defined worth was thrust into each otherâ€™s trust. With 6 months and a few weeks left, I have everything to thank you for, for the privilege to feel protected.
