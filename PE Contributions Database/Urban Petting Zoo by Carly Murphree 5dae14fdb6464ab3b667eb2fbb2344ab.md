**Urban Petting Zoo by Carly Murphree**

I’m driving north on Tamiami Trail through Sarasota is an area better known as The North Trail. I try to collect my thoughts but the methamphetamines have my mind skipping like a scratched CD making it impossible to tell what is real and what is imaginary. There’s a girl in the trunk trying to kick her way free but I don’t remember how she got there. Her muffled screams tell me she doesn’t like the seat I’ve picked out for her.

I pull into the Goodwill parking lot. It’s been closed for hours and the lot is deserted aside from an old guy getting a BJ in a car a few spaces down. I pop the trunk.

There are two girls in there. One is real and the other is inflatable but they are both tied up. The one breathing is pretty hot–bottle blonde hair, nice rack, slutty clothes...my type of girl. I wonder why she quit kicking and screaming–maybe it's the knife I’, holding. Her airheaded friend won't stop staring at me so I stab her in the chest and watch her deflate. I’ve never been a fan of fake tits anyway.

I tell the blonde I’m going to untie the scarf from her mouth and if she makes one wrong move I’m going to redecorate the trunk with her gray matter.

I tell her I have three questions–who are you and why do you think I put you in the trunk?

I tell her if I don’t like the answers for questions one and two then three is irrelevant. She looks like she’s about to scream so I punch her hard enough to knock her out but probably not kill her.

I get back in the car. I find a baggie of shards in my pocket so I make myself a shot. I shoot.

I don’t know how I got here but I’m driving on the trail again. I stop at a red light and a minivan pulls up next to me. There’s a kid staring at me from the backseat with mickey mouse ears on his head. I stifle the urge to get out and punch him in his stupid face when he sticks his tongue out at me. Doesn’t he know I’m a fucking rockstar? The light turns green so I hit the gas instead of him.

The night is full of terrors. I pull over because the hallucinations are hitting hard now. A zombie walks up to the window and asks for a dollar. I jump in the backseat and lay on the floor to hide from him. I hear music. Kendrick Lamar says Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe when I notice the Samsung under the seat. The screen says it’s my brother Mitch. I hit the answer button and a voice says I need to tell it where I am. That it will forgive me if I bring back its car. That I can keep the money as long as it's wife doesn’t find out what I’ve done. That it wants me to go to rehab. The voice is pissing me off. I hang up on it.

Kendrick starts rapping again but I ignore him this time. There’s something I still need to do...some loose end that needs to be tied...ah that girl.

I decide to give her to the zombie. When I got out of the car I see gime next to a bicycle laden with overstuffed

Hefty bags. I wave him over flashing my most charming meth mouth smile as I open the trunk and tell him I have something for him. He’s apprehensive but eager for a handout. This zombie is clearly homeless. The girl isn’t in the trunk–only the withered vinyl skin sack stares at me, her mouth forming a perfect o.

I can tell by his face that he has fallen in love. He ties his limp lover to the garbage sack and pedals away muttering sweet nothings into her partially chewed ear along the way.

I'm not as bothered as I probably should be by the disappearance of the other girl. Maybe she was never there but just in I used my pocket flashlight to scour every inch of the trunk for her. I find several possible shards and a spent bic lighter but no girl. Grateful the situation has resolved itself. I get back in the driver’s seat.

Hours of tweaking apps while I’m stuck in this spot. I have seventeen missed calls and one very long text message. I’m such a fucking loser. I’ve relapsed again. I’ve stolen from my brother again. I should get help. I should call Mitch and beg for forgiveness. I’m such a fuck up. I’m hopeless. I should kill myself and save my family the heartache of watching me fail time after time.

I pull the bag of crystal out of my pocket. Do I want to be a loser or a fucking astronaut. I choose outer space over real life any day and reach for the needle under my seat.
