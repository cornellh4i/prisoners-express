**“The Portal” by Calvin Clarke**

“Here’s another one.” I said, flipping the postcard-sized picture onto my manager’s desk.

“Whadaya talkin bout?” He asked through his tightly clenched, yellow teeth busily chomping on a half-smoked cigar, not bothering to look up from his typewriter.

“Just look.” I explained, pointing to the picture on his desk. “And this time I was able to enlarge it some with the Xerox.” I told him, pulling a folded sheet from my coat pockets.

Gruffly, he replied “Let me see.” I stood quietly as he turned the picture this way and that, trying to break the reflection of all the fluorescent tubes above.

The picture was an image of a long, wooden pier leading into a lake surrounded by mountains. At the end of the pier, a shadowy figure appeared to be sitting down, feet possibly dangling in the water.

“Here, here’s the enlargement,” I quickly told him, unfolding the Xerox and handing it to him. “Look at the head.” I instructed him. “Someone is coming out of the water!”

After a long moment of consideration, my desk manager said, “You’re right, there is something here. Looks like a nose and lips. Dim, but pretty unmistakable.”

“I found it posted on the bulletin board at the Woolworths. It’s just like the one from the Western Auto two weeks ago except in that one, it was an unknown pier leading into the ocean. And it’s very similar to the picture I saw on the safeway board a couple of months ago, only that time the shadowy figure was walking up a beach.”

“You know the difference between those first two pictures and this latest one?” He asked me, interrupting my rambling.

“No, what do you think?”

“I know where this one was taken.”

“Where is it? You have to tell me.” I said, placing the pictures back into my coat pocket.

“Me and the ol’ lady took a vacation a few years ago. We stayed at a resort called The Overlook. Down the road from there, there was an old restaurant we ate at called the Prairie Schooner. I took a smoke on that very pier one night after dinner.”

Giving me directions, I realized it was only a few hours drive. I gassed up the Packard at the corner Pointers and hit the road. It took me longer than expected and after having to ask directions twice, I found the Schooner. I parked my car beside the building just as the sun was coming up behind me.

The stone covered parking lot crunched under my shoes as I habitually lit a cigarette with my Zippo and made my way into the mist covered lake. The crunching turned to silence as I left the parking lot and made my way quietly across the dew-coated grass. My cigarette made a hiss when I flicked it away in the distance and I stepped onto the pier. The smell of the water was intoxicating.

Reaching the end of the pier, I saw nothing unusual at all, just the glassy surface of the water reflecting the dim sky. I took a step back and reached into my breast pocket for another smoke and pulled the Zippo from my right pocket, scanning the distant horizon as the sun steadily rose behind me. Halfway to its intended purpose, I closed the Zippo and dropped it back into my pocket slowly. The unlit cigarette dangled precariously, from my bottom as I stared in awe at the hole in the water that had silently appeared without my notice. It was right at the end of the pier, not large, probably three feet wide and five feet long. The water stopped right at the edge of the hole. I didn’t see any drips. It was as if something was holding it back.

I dropped the forgotten cigarette onto the pier when a set of rust, metal stairs slid slowly up out of the opening in the lake with a wet, muffled clanking sound that reminded me of the old wooden roller coaster as it climbed up the first incline that I used to ride in my childhood summers.

Curiosity being my game, I stepped down onto those rickety steps taking a quick glance over my shoulder to the safety of my Packard still parked beside the closed restaurant. The stairs lead down 30 or 40 feet at a pretty steep angle and the underwater passage had a luminescence of greens and blues that shimmered from the morning sun.

I continued down until I reached the damp, sandy bottom. Curious of the walls, I took notice of an extraordinary issue; the walls looked like they were held back by a chain-link fence, only with much larger squares and the fencing material was transparent and fine like 10-pound fishing line.

The water this “fence” held back bulged considerably inside each square as if struggling to break through but restrained by an incredible surface tension.

Taking several steps up the sandy path, I began to feel an incredible sensation of lightness, a buoyancy as it were, almost as if I were actually in the water. The further I walked, the lighter I became. This was madness. What trick of gravity was I witness to?

Reaching out, I examined the weird wall of water that reminded me of the pastel orange seat backs in the diner at the Howard Johnson’s. Like a pleated cushion, but this one transparent, not opaque orange. I probed it with one finger, lightly touching one of the pillowed centers and found that my finger easily penetrated the surface. Quickly pulling my hand back, I expected the water to come crashing in. I was surprised to find only a couple of drops followed my shaking hand back. These drops floated for a moment before slowly making their way to the ground with a soft plop.

I kept looking back, towards the stairs, half expecting them to fold back into their underwater position, and found I’d come quite far from the opening at the end of the pier when suddenly, from the unexplored depths of the passage, a voice.

“There’s no need to be frightened,” came the low grumbling of an ancient terror. “You are with us now. Those of nature forced to hide from the sun, no longer in our coffins, but protected by the fathoms of water above.”

The greenish-blue shimmering light reflected off of his marble-white face as he took a step closer. His eyes glowed a dim yellow, penetrating, mesmerizing. I felt fear but I could not turn to flee. A part of me wanted to step forward into his embrace.

From over his shoulder, I noticed several more figures, each with those dimly glowing eyes. Far, far away I heard a sound not unlike the rollercoaster of my childhood summers: clank, clank, clank.
