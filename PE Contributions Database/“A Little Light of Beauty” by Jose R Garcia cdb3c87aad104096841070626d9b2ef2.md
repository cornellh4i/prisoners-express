**“A Little Light of Beauty” by Jose R. Garcia**

Lt. Nevils breathes heavily before he knocks on the warden’s door. He relaxes his muscles and calms his heart with his breathing exercise. He gently knocks on the door. “Yeah, who is it?”

“It’s Lt. Nevils, sir.”

“Come in and shut the door.” Lt. Nevils comes in, noticing right away a bottle of whiskey on the warden’s desk. The warden is slumped on his chair like life has been drained out of him. He looked defeated and tired because of one man he might never see anymore. The warden turns toward the Lieutenant.’s direction, and his eyes were bloodshot, probably from tears or the whiskey he’s been drowning in. “Did you find anything, Lieutenant.?”

“Yes, I did, sir.” The lieutenant leans forward to hand him a small picture of a mountain view and a Bible. “All the rest of his property is being searched thoroughly by the officer.” The warden looks at the lieutenant a little bewildered because of the items he held.

“So why did you give me a picture and a Bible, Lieutenant?”

“The reason why I brought these items,” Lt. Nevils says, “is because the officer I interviewed gave me the same story. Every time they will do their security check, they would see Offender Joe just laying on his bed, staring at the picture. And when they will come around on their second round, Offender Joe will be in the same position, staring at the picture. Now here’s the weird part: when I interviewed Officer J.D., he told me that Joe will always be studying the Word and reciting Rev. 3:8. Now, if you open in Rev. 3:8, you will notice scriptures written next to it.” The warden examined Rev. 3:8 and also noticed John 10:9, Rev. 3:20, Proverb 8:33-36, and Luke 11:9-10. “Here’s the thing, Warden,” the lieutenant interrupts the warden’s thinking. “They all lead to a door.”

“You know what I found odd, strange, and weird, Lieutenant?!” Lt. Nevils steps back a little, sensing another one of his famous outbursts. “How can an inmate escape from a high security prison?! Especially when he is locked within a cell, and all you can tell me is that you found a picture and a Bible?! I have Huntsville and the Governor up my ass, wanting questions.”

*Boom! Boom!* Both the warden and the lieutenant jump and face the door. “Who the hell is banging at my door?!” The warden screams. A scrawny person enters the office: he is short with red hair and big classes, making his eyes 2 times bigger. “What the hell do you want, Officer Redwood?!” The warden roars.

Officer Redwood cringes when his name was yelled and moves a little forward, “We found something.”

The warden jumps out of his seat and yells, “You found him!”

“No, sir. We found a letter,” Officer Redwood says.

“A letter,” the warden repeats.

“Yes, sir. A letter addressed to you,” the officer answers. He leans over to hand over the letter, and then he immediately leaves the office. The warden begins to read the letter:

“If you are reading this letter, Warden, I wanted to let you know that when I first arrived at your facility, I truly felt evil within this prison. A good friend of mine once told me that prison is a seed of destruction to the people who fall victim to its ways. Prison also takes away hope, joy, and life. The only thing it can’t take away is the soul, the spirit, and God’s love. The Word of God helped me open new doors. Look at me--I’m gone! I successfully passed through into a beautiful world, a realm that many have been trying to destroy for so long. But yet, it still stands true, tall, and majestic in its own way. You are probably saying bullcrap! To you, it might be because you will never understand. When I read Rev. 3:8, I was determined: I put all my strength, meditation, and prayers into a small picture I posted against the wall. For days, I stared at the picture, seeing myself walking at the base of the mountain and gazing at the creation of our Creator. How the clouds blended with the blue skies, and the sun shines through, caressing the mountain with its touch and illuminating the snow-covered peaks. After a while of meditation and patience, I was able to walk through the forest. I felt truly alive and free. It is an awesome experience to leave your little hotel to a home of peace.

“You could either believe or keep on searching, but you will never find me. The only thing I could tell you, Warden, for your own good is that time is getting near. You need to make a decision with your life. Joshua said, ‘Choose for yourself this day whom you will serve.’ It’s time to let go of the flesh ways because we put a lot of effort in this human flesh. The Word tells us that the things that are seen are only temporary, but the things that aren’t seen are eternal. You are probably saying bullshit! To you, it might be bull because you’re still subjected to the regulations and principles of the world. ‘Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle, blinding you from the truth because of your blindness, you will never understand.’ Take care and keep your head up.”

The lieutenant grabs the picture and looks closely, and he spots him--Joe--walking along side with someone else. The lieutenant’s heart beats rapidly and yells, “Warden!”

“What do you want, Lieutenant?” The warden yells back.

The lieutenant pauses, realizing what he was about to do. He decides to keep it to himself. “I just want to know what you want me to do with these items,” the lieutenant says.

“I don’t care. Throw them away and get out of my office,” the warden replies.

The lieutenant steps out of the office and out of the building and looks up to the sky. He says, “I’ll be joining you pretty soon, Joe, because I believe. I see the truth written in this creation. The lieutenant smiles and pushes forward.
