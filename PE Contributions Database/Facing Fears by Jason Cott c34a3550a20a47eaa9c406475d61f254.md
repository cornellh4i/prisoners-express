****Facing your fears can be a very rewarding experience. Take, for instance, somebody who’s afraid of spiders, then goes out and buys a tarantula. Or someone who’s afraid of heights, then goes skydiving. The feeling of accomplishment can be intoxicating.

Fear is in us all, from the little wimpy kid in elementary school hiding from the bullies, to the 16 year old girl afraid to tell her parents she’s pregnant, to the grown man in prison paying someone for protection. Fear is just a part of life, but it’s how you respond to fear that sets the cowards from the courageous.

When I first came to prison, I’ll admit, I was scared. Anyone who says they weren’t is a liar! But that fear I had to face, I had no choice in the matter. Of course, I could have gone into P.C., but then I’d be running for the rest of my life. So P.C. was not an option for me. I knew I’d have to fight, and I knew I’d have to prove myself. Everything else was a mystery.

As soon as I got off the bus, I got into a fight with a guy trying to exhort me. I came out of that fight with more battle scars than the other guy did, but I gained a ton of respect. So in the long run, I may have gotten beat up, but I was the winner because I earned the respect of my peers. And no one since has tried to exhort me.

After that, I ran into a lot of buddies from the streets, and so it was kind of a reunion of sorts. Of course, I had to prove myself, and since then, I’ve been able to just do time. It seems that my fears were unfounded.

Some people, though, don’t fare so well in facing their fears. Like the person afraid to fly, going on his first flight, and the plane crashes. Or the person afraid of heights goes on his roof and falls off and is paralyzed for life. Of course, these instances are one in a million, but sometimes, that one is all it takes.

Also, some fears are irrational, like the fear of dying or getting skin cancer. You become a hermit and stay inside your entire life. I know these fears are real because I’ve heard their stories, even met a couple people like that. These people live in perpetual fear, never experiencing the joys of walking through the grass or smelling roses that have freshly bloomed. For people like this, I truly feel sorry because they are missing out on so much, and they just don’t know it.

Some fears are healthy though; being afraid of some things keeps you safe. If you’re afraid of fire, you’ll never have to worry about being burnt or being afraid of heights can keep you away from tall buildings and cliffs where you could fall and be injured, or worse.

In today’s day and age, some people say that if you have fear in your heart, you’re a coward. I don’t believe that, though. No, I think the real coward is the person who’s hiding his fear instead of facing it. The guy that everybody thinks is so tough, so brave, but secretly, he’s afraid to face his biggest fear. He’s afraid of what he might find in himself. That is the true coward!
