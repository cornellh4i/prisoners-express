**“In a Perfect World” by Robert Taliaferro**

I am not a religious person, nor am I one to celebrate events that most people feel is a necessary thing.

One of my biggest pet peeves is when some smiling face, whether prisoner or staff, comes up to me out of the clear blue and asks, “Hey Mr. T, how are you doing today?”

I generally look at them with disdain. Years ago I would often retort, “How the fuck do you think I am doing? I am in prison and only fools or people who are institutionalized are having a good time in prison.”

Another time, after a sergeant asked me the same question, I replied, “Well Sarge, it’s been 25 years since the last time that I killed someone and I have sure run across some stupid little pricks on both sides of the fence that could use some killing, so I guess I am doing okay.”

One of the jailhouse Christians once noted that I should be thankful that I am alive and that I have my health. Another jailhouse Muslim agreed with him and they tried to invite me to come to a Jumah service to see how one could give thanks for that health and life.

As I get older, and perhaps wiser, I tend to be a bit more tolerant of those who simply follow blindly to a particular theology whether it is religious in nature, an idealism regarding why a specific ideology is practiced on the streets, or worse, those who follow anything regardless of how foolish it is, simply because they want to belong to something.

Don’t get me wrong, if people want to give thanks at Thanksgiving or Christmas or Valentine’s Day or Easter Sunday, that’s all fine, and that is something that they have a right to do. My question is, however, why does one have to just wait for a specific event, or a specific day to be thankful?

In a perfect world, for me, people would be thankful for things that would be sensible. They would be thankful when young men in Chicago stop killing each other over street corners.

They would be thankful to see the smile on their child’s face on a visit and be thankful that someone answers the phone when they call, especially after they cursed out their mom, dad, girlfriend, aunt, wife, sister, brother on the last call.

They would be thankful to gain their freedom and the decision never to come back to prison again. They would be thankful that they were born who they are, and not subscribe to be someone else because that other person has more money, or better clothes, or a newer car or a bigger house.

As the 1970s song went, “Just be thankful, for what you got.”

In my world, the only thing that I can be thankful for is that I have beautiful, intelligent children, grandchildren, and now great grandchildren, and even with that thought, there is the tragedy that 1) I selfishly took a life to get where I am today and 2) because of that action, I cannot truly share in the lives of those young people whom I love so much...but, as this is not a perfect world, I suppose that I can give thanks for one thing: The fact that when I do die someday, I will not have been just an asterisk in the cosmic book of life and that my line will not end with me, as it will happen with so many of the people in prison today.

I often think about that and hope that one day one of my daughters or sons--or their progeny--will do great things. Perhaps one may find a cure for cancer of HIV/AIDS. Perhaps one will become a judge or win a Pulitzer or Nobel. Perhaps one will simply show the world how to make an unselfish sacrifice that will have a global impact some day.

Or...perhaps they will just be proud to be my progeny, regardless of the foolishness that landed me in prison.

I guess now I can conclude this treatise with a smile. That one guy was right...after all, in order to have those great children in my life, I have to be alive and healthy…

Damn!
