**“My Duty” by James BooHoos**

It seems to be trendy for people to shirk their duties nowadays. To actually adhere to a sense of purpose is a thing of the distant past. If you’ve got direction, you’re likely to be called “lame” by some

I refuse to let modernity of any sore, form, or fashion hinder me from my sworn duty: to be the most honest, intelligent whiner on the face of the earth.

I have reached the pinnacle of grievance artistry. No administration, office, policy, agency, political party, or party organizer is beyond my wail-power.

Thank me now or later, you are not welcome.
