“Everybody’s Frustrated” by Deadrian Gainous

Try sitting in prison a decade when you could’ve been home in 2 or 3 years. Try holding onto a girlfriend the whole decade you’re in prison. Try being a factor in your kids’ lives when he/she is 18, but was only 8 when you left the world. Try respecting authority when authority doesn't respect you. Try being rushed out of your cell for chow, medical, rec, church, commissary, some type of appointment ----- just to WAIT until the door is opened and you can go.Around here it’s, “Hurry up and wait.” Try talking to these younger guys (sometimes older ones too), giving them “Game”, a method for achieving an objective. About doing time, about life, etc. But the more you give ‘em, the less they take heed to. Try going to the commissary window, just to be told you don’t have any money on your account. Try telling the doctor you have some type of problem and they tell you the only thing they can do is prescribe you ibuprofen. Most times they don’t do that. Try having to live with a cellie you could live without. I can go on and on with this that frustrates us in prison.

But on the flip-side ----- who do you think is frustrated with us? Me, I’m 34 years old, been on-lock 10 ½ years EVERYBODY is frustrated with me. My mom, I know she’s tired of her son being in prison. (This is my 2nd time) I did 2 years the first time, stayed out 9 months, and was back in with a 10 year sentence. Both times she has been there for me. My sister, she’s 3 years older than me, there’s nothing she won’t do for me. She writes, sends money, even get in contact with people. My grand-mother constantly displays her love for me. My Daughters, Azia and Tavie, have had to grow up the last 10 years without me in their lives. It’s frustrating to be a young lady without the guidance, knowledge, and wisdom from your father because he’s in prison. I’m sure their mothers are frustrated having to raise a child as a single parent.

People are tired of having to write letters, visit me in prison, and put money on my books. They’re tired of celebrating holidays and birthdays without me. They’re tired of getting cards and drawings, it was okay at first, but now it has become repetitious. They’re tired of parole denying me year after year. I’m tired of getting denied year after year.

Being frustrated is the reason I’m still in prison. I came to prison in 2007 with a 10 year sentence, by me not knowing how to deal with the pressure of being back locked up after being out for only 9 months, not knowing how to deal with the disappointment I caused by coming right back to prison, I took my frustration out on a guard and sent him to the hospital. I got 10 more years for “Assault of a Public Servant” stacked on top of my original 10 year sentence. The frustration was so built-up I took it out on the guard ----- that wasn’t healthy, it was straight dumb!! If it wasn’t for that I would’ve been home years ago on parole or discharged a few months ago. Either way, I wouldn’t be sitting in a cell writing this.

So the next time you feel “frustrated”, take a deep breath, do some push-ups, pray, or write a letter. At one time or another, we all feel thwarted, but you never know how strong you are until being strong is the only option you have!!
