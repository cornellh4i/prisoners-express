“**What I am Thankful For” by William H. Sprayberry Jr.**

I thought I’d never get to experience it. I’d been married before and my wife and I tried. I tried with a couple women too. For whatever reason, it never happened. I started to feel like something must be wrong with me.

For as far back as I can remember, I wanted to be a dad. Everybody plays house when they are kids. The game where a little boy plays dad and a little girl plays mom. I always loved being a dad, even as a little boy. I couldn’t wait until I got to be an adult and become a real dad.

So you can imagine the frustration and hurt I felt, when as an adult, it wasn’t happening. My younger brother had kids and so have my friends. Yet here I was, childless, and I’d wanted to be a father more than anyone else I knew. I felt like a huge failure after every pregnancy test my wife/girlfriend would take that came back negative.

I’d almost given up on my dream of being a father. I’d started to think maybe it wasn’t in the cards for me. The worst part of it all was seeing all these guys who did have kids that didn’t want them.

They were always complaining about child support, or problems with the mother of their children. Deadbeat dads always pissed me off. They had these wonderful children that looked up to and relied upon them, and they ran from that. All a kid really wants is a mommy and dad who loves them. They didn't ask to be brought into the world. Now their dad is too busy to spend time with them. He complains because they need money. A kid can’t get a job and support themselves.

You’d think a man who created an innocent child would want to give money to the little person who carries their last name. You’d think they’d want to guide those little people in life so they can grow up to be good big people. But way too many in our world today look down at those babies they created and see nuisance.

When they hear them cry, they only think of the noise. They don’t stop to consider that maybe the baby just wants to be held by their daddy. They run away from their responsibilities.

Those dads ignore the children they brought into the world and complain because the government garnishes their wages. While men like me would die to have a child who calls them daddy. It would be a dream come true. The government wouldn’t have to take my money because I would love to give every penny I have to make sure my child has everything they need.

I never thought I’d get to experience being a daddy after trying for so long to have a child of my own with no success until I met Barbara. Even then, I didn’t get to have children the typical way. They technically weren’t my daughters. But you wouldn’t be able to tell them that. No, to them, I am daddy Jay.

I cherished every single second I got to be a dad. If you want to know what I’m thankful for, it’s pushing two little girls on a swing set. It’s talking to the baby through Barbara’s belly when she was still pregnant with her. It’s laying between them on the living room floor reading the “Wizard of Oz.” I’m thankful for every smile we ever got to share. I thank God I got to be daddy Jay.

I may only be their stepdad and I might not ever get to see them again since Barbara and I aren’t together anymore. She left me when I came to prison. But when they started calling me daddy Jay and I told them that it was okay; it’s a responsibility i accepted for the rest of my life.

If they ever need anything, I’ll be there. I’m going to put money in three separate accounts for them for college, even if I’m not allowed to see them anymore because their mother moved on. Then, when they are older, they will know daddy Jay always loved them like they were really my daughters. I’m thankful for every single memory I got to make with my little family. I’ll always be daddy Jay and those baby girls and their mother will always be the reason my dreams came true.
