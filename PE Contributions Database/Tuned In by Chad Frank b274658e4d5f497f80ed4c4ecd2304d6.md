**“Tuned In” by Chad Frank**

I’ve always been tuned in to the zeitgeist-- often before pop culture changed the channel from their regularly scheduled programming.

When I was two, in 1983, I latched onto the Hulkmania bandwagon months before Hulk Hogan beat the Iron Sheik for the World Wrestling Federation title and the phenomenon got its official launch. My mom had a hard time finding Hulk Hogan and other WWF merchandise on my Christmas list that year because pro wrestling had yet to become a fad.

A year or so later, the same thing happened with **Transformers:** The show hadn’t tsunamied its way onto American shores, when I discovered it. I was the first boy in my neighborhood to have the Optimus Prime action figure.

When I was about six or so, I got cable TV in my room -- a luxury that allowed me to explore pop culture’s vast landscape at my own leisure. The kids at school were always envious when I’d catch them up to date or tell them about shows their own parents wouldn’t let them watch. My grandfather was shocked when I told him that I watched **The Howard Stern Show.**

As a preteen, I stumbled across MTV shows like **Headbanger’s Ball, Alternative Nation,** and **120 Minutes**. It was through these shows that I found out about Nirvana and Green Day long before those bands topped the Billboard charts.

Through Green Day, I discovered bands like Operation Ivy, Rancid, Offspring, and Bad Religion and the like who were about to ride a second wave of punk popularity into the mainstream. By 1995-1996, the same kids who kicked my ass for having a pink Mohawk now had pink Mohawks of their own. A punk rock civil war of sorts broke out, as my friends and I took up arms against the newly self-identified punkers, with both sides accusing the other of being posers.

As a teenager, I’d once again found myself on the cutting-edge. I was spending the night at my friend Mike’s house, when he suggested that we watch wrestling. I’d not watched wrestling in years, mainly because it had gotten too cartoonish for my punk rock sensibilities. But since I was bored and nothing else was on TV, I reluctantly agreed. My expectations dropped when he tuned in to the cable-access channel. I was expecting to see the usual schlock that gets relegated to the land of infomercials. What I was assaulted by shattered my expectations of what pro wrestling was:

Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) lived up to its name, with matches featuring barbed wire, thumbtacks, fire, tables, and wild brawls through the audience with fans handing wrestlers weapons like cookie sheets, frying pans, and even plastic dinosaurs. Its homebase was a rundown bingo hall in South Philly-- the hometown connection made it all the more alluring. I sat on the edge of my seat for the next hour, mesmerized. ECW was punk rock incarnate: The bastard spawn of **Rocky Horror Picture Show, Jerry Springer** and slasher movies. Suddenly, wrestling was cool again, and I was hooked. Friends and family ridiculed me for “being too old to like wrestling.”

A few months later, my wrestling fan friends and I started our own promotion, staging matches in our backyards and basements. Just like in ECW, our matches involved blood and weapons. This was in 1996, long before the backyard wrestling craze plagued the nation. So I guess my friends and I can be counted among the pioneers of backyard wrestling.

The WWF would come along with it’s Attitude Era, which was basically a watered-down version of ECW. Like with punk rock, all I could do was shake my head in disgust at all of those who’d talked shit and heated on me, only to fall right in line once pro wrestling became mainstream.

It can be argued that I’m ahead of the curve even with the criminal charges. I was busted in 2003, just as US CUSTOMS was transitioning to ICE and developing a cyber crime unit -- in fact, my case was only the second or third child pornography cases investigated by the unit. I was also among the first to receive a stiff sentence for child pronography-related charges (420 months).

Currently, I am leading the way for sex offenders to be treated equally. I am doing this by being outspoken and honest, all the while shattering the stereotypes associated with sex offenders by carrying myself with dignity and respect.

Some people may say I’m “tuned in”; I just consider myself being fiercely independent. If what I like becomes popular, fine. If not, I could care less-- the fact that I’m being authentic is all that matters to me.
