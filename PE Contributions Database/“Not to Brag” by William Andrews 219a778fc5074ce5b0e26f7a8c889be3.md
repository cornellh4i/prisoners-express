**“Not to Brag” by William Andrews**

I’ll be fifty next month, outliving my dad and most of mankind prior to about 1870. In a somewhat morbid way, I am a winner.

Not to brag, but I’ve got all of my limbs, and my five senses still work fairly good, considering all I’ve done to be counterproductive in preserving them. So I’m winning.

But by no means “winning” like a well known but washed up Hollywood Actor that captured the word. But if he felt as if he were winning then let him have it. One man’s winning is sometimes another’s losing. But the flip side is when one door shuts, another opens.

More than a handful of years in prison have left me desolate of that winning feeling that is sought and sometimes found by athletes and gamblers, since I am neither. Since I am still lucky enough to be able to read and write, unlike most of Europe prior to the Renaissance, I did find some of that spark that winners feel for a little while. Actually, it is rekindled each time I open my Summer edition of PE and see my themes essay among the few that were chosen for the newsletter.

Now that made me feel like a winner, not to brag, of course.
