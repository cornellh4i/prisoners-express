More than a decade ago, my aunt hosted a family Christmas Eve party which I’ll never forget. Over an hour late, we showed up just in time for our “family tradition” which is to gather around the Christmas tree while everyone opens their one present and sings Christmas carols. Taking our seats, my mother joined the other women on the couches as my stepfather grabbed a chair and sat next to her. Standing up, I watched my younger siblings spread around the colorful tree in search of their presents, then I took my seat in between my older male cousins and stepfather.

After everyone opened their gifts, my 16 year old cousin handed me a plastic candy cane filled with chocolate Hershey kisses. “Here, give this to Josh.” Oblivious to what was going on, I handed it to my stepfather. A minute later, while everyone was in the midst of singing, my step dad started spitting furiously at the tree. Wide eyed, everyone turned their attention to him except for my two older male cousins who had small smirks on their faces. While my mom tried to console him, my little sister stole a Hershey kiss then bursted into a tantrum. My aunt noticed my cousins’ smirking faces who claimed they didn’t do anything, but she asked them to leave once she and my mom found the source of displeasure. They left the room in smothered giggles, and my stepdad mean mugged me as I flopped on the floor, laughing hysterically.

The next morning, my step dad called me into the bathroom to trim and edge up my baby gro. Barely a few seconds into the cut, I felt the cold clippers graze my skull: “Damn! It looks like I forgot my guard,” he said in a sneering voice. From my peripheral vision, I saw his wicked grin as he continued, “Unless you wanna go to service like this, I’ma have to chop it all off.” Producing a mirror, I was instantly brought to literal tears. What I saw resembled a driveway surrounded by a well-tended lawn. Wiping my tears away, I told him, “Cut it off!”

After the dreadful shearing was over, I found a dark blue beanie and attached it to my head like a wig before leaving for church.

Once inside, we were greeted by the many new faces and the pastor as we found our seats in the back row. A deacon, my step dad went and relieved the pastor of the podium. After a few words, my stepdad announced, “The amazing choir is going to perform a blessed song!” Clapping, the entire church watched as the choir formed together. With me being the lead singer, everyone urged me to take my post. Hesitant, I made my way slowly. As soon as I walked out into the aisle, an old woman snatched my beanie off. “Child talk,” she started to say before she saw my head. Embarrassed, I walked out of the church as people gasped and commented, “Is he OK?” Another replied, “He looks like he has cancer.”

My head needed a couple of years of tanning to match the rest of my skin tone. :(
