“Thankful” by J. Bauhaus

I’m thankful that these greedy, cost-cutting corporate prison shitz haven’t yet brainstormed a way for them to eat us and have us too. Or, more properly, feed us to ourselves and still have us to collect their blood money off of us from the state politicians’ tax herd. They’d all love to grind us up into mystery meat instead of have to feign expensive rehabilitation programs. One proof of this is the new corporate (and state, if it works) prison food strategy which is sweeping your way. Get ready for your warden to suddenly take away all of your fruit. This is what the GEO prison corp CS-ers did here on August 18, 2017. If you’re not a muslim or a jew, you now get zero fruit.

How did the prison corp manage to steal away with an entire food group that is required for a healthy diet?

Very cunningly, their HQ in Florida paid a dietician to scribble his indecipherable signature on their no-fruit menu. Then, to make certain that his anonymity cannot be cracked, they “copyrighted” their new menu, adding the lawyer clause, “Proprietary! No copying allowed!” This way, they can pretend that it is illegal for them to permit you to buy a copy to show to a judge. Pretty clever, yes? We can’t get a copy to show the judge, so the judge can say, smugly, “No proof, no crime!” We can’t find out which dietician approved the illegal, no-fruit menu, so we can’t sic the dietitian certification board on him for malpractice. Good God, these sleazy bizcrats are slick! They’ve thought of everything this time!
