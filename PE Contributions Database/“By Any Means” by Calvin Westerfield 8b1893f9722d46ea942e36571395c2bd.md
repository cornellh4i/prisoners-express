**“By Any Means” by Calvin Westerfield**

****This morning, I woke earlier than normal because an officer knocked on my door to tell me the transportation truck would be here in 20 minutes to take me “somewhere.” It’s 4:30 AM, and having no other choice but to comply, I got up and hurried to get dressed to be transported “somewhere.”

The worst feeling for me is not knowing what I’m about to walk into, but on the dot, as I just finished getting ready, two giant transportation officers were at the cell door barking orders. I happen to live in a Level 5 facility which is maximum security in Michigan, and so the whole process of leaving my cell and making it to the transportation bus is very tedious I have to turn my back to the food slot at my door to be handcuffed from behind, and then a five foot dog leash is attached to the cuffs (no kidding). I am literally walked to a tiny caged-on shower and made to strip naked then get dressed again. Now, my hands get cuffed in front of me a black shield is placed over the cuffs, and this metal bar slides through it with a hole for the belly chain to slide through. Then I have to spin in a complete circle to wrap the chain around my waist, and it gets fastened, very snuggly, back to the black box. Now my top half is secure. I’m walked to the control center where further security measures are taken. Leg chains are cuffed to my ankles, and finally, a shock collar controlled by an officer is strapped to my calf. Once all this is complete, I attempt again to find out where I am going. An officer yells “medical,” so I leave it alone.

Four and a half hours later, we pull up to another facility where I’m being seen by an optometrist for a 15 minute eye test, and it’s back on the bus for the 5 hour ride back! Yeah, that’s what I said. You wouldn’t think the State would find more convenient ways to have a prisoner’s eyes examined and save some taxpayer money but that’s obviously not the case.

So there is one elderly man that was also taken along with me to get the eye test. The whole ride there, he was complaining how the leg chains were too tight, cuffing into the bone of his ankle. The officers simply do not “adjust security equipment while their cargo is away from their housing facility.” By the time we got back, I could see tears in the man’s eyes because the pain was excruciating. The officers opened the doors and ordered us inside the facility. The man refused to walk. They gave him a “direct order,” and he didn’t budge. He couldn't move! Guess what? One of the officers picked him up, threw him on his shoulder, and carried him inside.
