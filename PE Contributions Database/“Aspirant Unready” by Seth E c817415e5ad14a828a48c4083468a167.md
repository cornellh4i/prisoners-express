**“Aspirant Unready” by Seth E.**

I kneel respectfully, peering through the lace at the High One. When they open their eyes, my gaze falls - I can’t keep eye contact with them.

“Tell me what happened, why you’ve failed.”

“I’m not sure, High One. The prisoner was...determined. Nothing I said led him from his path.” I swallow loudly.

“Apparently.” Their pause is...pregnant. “Let’s unpack it. What did you say?”

“I asked him to consider how his family would feel if he were to do this. How his children might feel, how his mother and girlfriend might feel. I asked him to think of a little thing that brings joy to him - a cup of coffee, a song. To consider that, even just thinking about how these things can be a salve to our sadness. And if that much could be better, it’s proof that things can be better, so it’s not hopeless.” My eyes are still betraying me - I can feel tears threatening to escape my lashes. The necklace chafes my collarbone.

“...Child…” They sigh gently. “Can you truly think to lie here? In this place? Please, be honest.”

So choked, the words are barely a whisper. “It was *him*.”

“Yes, which only made your task that much more important.”

“After what he did to Alexxa, to take this way out is better than he deserved.”

“So people who hurt our sisters, our family, they deserve to suffer?”

“Yes…”

“And what of the suffering *we* cause? Are any of us truly innocent? Have *you* not hurt someone? Have *you* not been the cause of suffering? Do you deserve to suffer, too?”

I can’t answer. I shrug. They sigh again.

“He did not recognize you.” Not a question, but I confirm with a shake of my head. “But you know him to be the man who raped and beat Alexxa, her ex-boyfriend, father of your nephew.”

Finally, I manage a croaked “Yes.”

So, when you were meant to lift his despair, to ease the suffering of a prisoner -- the same gift *you* received when *you* were a prisoner, let us remember -- you instead chose to prick his conscience, right?”

“Yes, High One.” They waited, and I knew I must explain more. “I brought up his family because I know they’ve disowned him. I brought up his children because I know he’s failed as a father, and his girlfriend because I know he’d been convicted for having beaten his last one to death. I mentioned these ‘small pleasures’ because I know he’d once been a lover of fine coffee and a failed musician…”

“So, what could *seem* to be encouragement to live, was actually calculated knife-twisting meant to push this man into the final act, yes?” They won’t let him off the hook after a mere confession. The High One must know I fully grasp my choice.

“...Yes, High One.” They shake their head.

“Aren’t we even having this conversation because you’d meant to model the … grace you once received?” They knew the answer already; this is rhetorical.

“Maybe I’m never going to make it to the place, High One. Maybe this is as good as I can be.”

“If that were true, child, I would not even be here, would not exist.” They put a finger under my chin, nudge me to look at them, focus on them. “You have potential, child. Perhaps you are only...*unready*. But you must grow, must...*aspire* to be ready. Yes?”

“Yes, High One.”

They nod, rise, and walk away. “You will become ready when you *decide* to be, child.”

“Yes, High One,” I reply, though they are already gone.
