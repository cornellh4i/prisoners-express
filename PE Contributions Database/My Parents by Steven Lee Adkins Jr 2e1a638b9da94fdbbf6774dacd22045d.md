**My Parents By Steve Lee Adkins Jr.**

Where to begin? My parents were great. They were, and I say “were” because my father is dead and prison has placed many physical miles between my mother and I; perfect in many ways and flawed in many ways, like we all are.

My father spent much time with me, sharing his love of the outdoors and passing that quality to me. He’d take me hunting wild mushrooms, where I could breathe deep the damp, old, forest air. Where the tortoise would eye my presence suspiciously and sagely through red-rimmed eyes.

And where rabbits bolted through tender grass that had been awoken by spring’s gentle caress. In the late fall and early winter, I’d literally follow in his footsteps like he’d taught me, so as a child, I wouldn’t make unnecessary noise. Occasionally, stepping on a frost covered acorn where I placed my feet, would gain a frown over his shoulder.

He'd turn and continue after the echoes of the seemingly small explosion died away into the otherwise still, but watchful forest. My mother also had a love of nature and passed it to me. I was her shadow in our vegetable garden and her flower garden. Apparently a green thumb is hereditary, going back to our time untold. My mother is still alive and was recently telling me about her father being crippled when she was younger, and her and my grandmother, Goldie, gathering berries until their fingers hurt.

Keeping their family fed and the lights on and making ends meet. I remember collecting black walnuts with my mother, and what we didn’t share with the squirrels that she had tamed, we used claw hammers to crack open on large unopened blocks of firewood. Cold winters like this one reminds me of the firewood my father and I would cut and split, and eating those walnuts, a much simpler time… the good ol’ days.
