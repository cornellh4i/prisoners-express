I'd give anything to catch that Spring Fever just one more time. To feel that surge of life, of new beginnings and second chances, of raw energy and unbridled passion, would be well worth the cost, no matter what it is. Once the fever grabs hold and spreads throughout your body all bets are off. Your thoughts become almost animal-driven by desire and the thrill of the hunt-and your dreams are filled with wonder and discovery, love and lust. Your days are overcome with sunburnt adventures, subaqueous explorations, and the scents of wildflowers and heavy doses of petrichor. Your nights are ridden with long walks along the riparian grit, hordes of loyal (almost fanatic) hide-and-seekers vying for the ultimate spot, and swarms of flaming fliers racing through the darkness. Its like you become a different person for those few weeks, those feverish months.

I long for those hand painted sunsets, the sound of rain falling on a tin roof, gathering of family and friends, and the heated embrace of that special someone. I didn't realize what these things meant to me until I lost them (yes, It Is true what they say). Like so many things, I took them for granted. I just always knew they would be around waiting for my attention.

A part of me (a cold, angry part) has come to loathe the Spring Fever and everything it represents. That part of me doesn't want me to go outside when it's warm, doesn't want to feel the sun's rays on my face, doesn't want to inhale the scent of fresh cut grass, or watch the deer run across the lush hillside. He only wants to pace to-and-fro-In his cage and hate the world. He’s slowly consuming me, my thoughts, my dreams. It’s as if he wants to drive out every memory of those better days, those frozen moments In time. It takes everything I have- my will, strength, vigor-to hold on, to keep my grip tight, to remain in control. Sometimes I question-In the dead of night-whether It’d be easier to just give in to this doppelganger, this distorted reflection of myself. It would be so easy to hand over the reins and climb Into the passenger seat. Im not sure why I hang on to these fleeting thoughts, these snapshots of a forgotten realm.

These are things I struggle with everyday since being exiled from the real world. The battle is always raging inside of my tainted encephalon, my tormented soul. I literally cringe at the sound of Spring approaching because I know what lies beneath its surface, hungry and ready to pounce.
