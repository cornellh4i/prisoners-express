**“Needle Boy” by Nate A. Lindell**

Benji was a peculiar boy. From before he could remember, when he got really angry, a needle would sprout from his skin, sometimes several needles. Often, after time, the needles would fall away. But some needles, ones that grew when he was especially angry, never fell away.

By the time Benji was old enough to go to school, he looked like a mangy silver-dipped porcupine from all the steel needles poking from his skin. The other children quickly learned to keep their distance from Benji to avoid being poked. This made Benji feel special as he was treated differently.

As years passed, Benji grew used to his condition. He was used to sitting alone at lunch, used to not playing with the other kids ⎯ football and basketball, he quickly found, were out of the question! But, unknown to Benji, a girl, Amy, had been watching and felt sad that he was always alone.

On the first day of the beginning of their fifth grade school year, Amy sat by Benji at lunch.

“Hi,” Amy politely said.

Benji stared at her, his mouth open. The partially chewed ravioli he’d been savoring plopped on his plate, falling from his mouth.

“Hi,” he replied.

LIke a skilled dentist, Amy eased words painlessly, from Benji’s mouth, innocently asking him about his needles. Benji then told her everything.

“Oh my,” Amy said, “I wonder what might happen if you got really… happy.”

“No one ever asked me that,” Benji, mouth agape, observed.

That night, when Benji went to bed, he noticed many of the needles that had been with him for months, some for years, had fallen away!

As months passed, Benji’s needles fell away, until by the end of the year, he had no more silvers of steel poking from him. Often, he walked Amy home, talking with her along the away, with a resistant needle here and there, occasionally dropping free. However, Amy never let Benji walk her up to her house’s door. Sometimes, when they are close to Amy’s house, Benji heard shouting, things being thrown and crashing in the house. Sometimes, Benji saw bruises on Amy or a faintly black eye. Sometimes, Amy missed school.

There was a dance at the end of the year. Benji wanted to ask Amy to go to the dance, but she hadn’t been coming to school for over a week. Although he knew Amy didn’t want him to do so, Benji decided to go to Amy’s house and ask if she was okay.

That’s what he did after school.

Benji observed that Amy’s house was not much more than a shack. Its siding weathered red asphalt shingles. The lights were not on.

Benji knocked. No one answered.

He knocked again, louder, then louder still.

After what must have been over twenty knocks, the door opened. A swollen, unshaven man’s face loomed over Benji, who was nauseated at the stench of spilled beer and old sweat that poured from the doorway. “How,” Benji wondered, “could Amy smell so good and live in this house?”

“Um, excuse me, sir,” Benji mumbled, “I’m a friend of Amy’s and was wondering why she hasn’t been in school for a while.”

“How should I know,” the man said, scratching his beard, looking down at Benji suspiciously, “she hasn’t come out of her room for days.”

“She hasn’t?” Benji said, concerned. A glistening steel needle slowly sprouted from his scalp.

“You’re, you’re that boy,” the man said, nervously.

“Yes,” Benji said, “sir, may I please see Amy?”

He didn’t wait for an answer, stepped past the man and into the house, a house far different from his own.

“Fine,” the man said, “Her room’s upstairs, first door on the left.”

Benji went to Amy’s door. The stench coming from inside was different.

The doctor, ten years later, had given up asking Benji what happened at Amy’s house. Benji couldn’t remember and the needles that shot out from his skin, though slender, had a pesky habit of piercing wood, glass, even steel, and the doctor’s tissues.

Benji never found out what would happen if he became really happy. He didn’t want to remember what happened when he became really sad, really angry.
