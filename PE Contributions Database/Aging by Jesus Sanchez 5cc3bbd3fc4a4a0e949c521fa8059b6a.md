**"Aging" by Jesus Sanchez**

Aging is a process that all of us must go through. A process that comes with much learning and patience through this life's journey.

There is no fountain of youth provided. There is no escape. All we can do is use it to our advantage. Aging is not bad, it's not our enemy, it's part of growing up.

Because of aging, many have become a great part, and of good use to the world that we live on. Many have become great leaders that guide armies to victory. While others raise beautiful families that flourish like daisies in a field.

Aging is not failure, but victory, for you and those around you. Through aging we learn to be wise.
