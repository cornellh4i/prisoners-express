**“Mountain” by Lauren Shepherd**

That ridgeline held so many memories of mine. The remembrance of laughing, the foiling anger when he chose her, failing every hit of the progress we’d made. The loss of the pedestal that I’d held him on for so many interminable years. I remembered how we’d leaned against the hood of that beat-up old SUV, laughing and talking about how I was gonna change and how he’d find me someday if I did. I looked up at that old mountain and recalled the last time I was there, as my herd and world were falling apart as he chose that young child of a woman. I held up the piece of paper with all the things I’d ever wanted to say to him, all the things I should have said, and I held up my lighter and lit that paper on fire. The spark of flame lit up the smell circling around me, then crumbled into ash as I dropped it into the river. I looked around at the trees, the sky above me and took in the silence as I finally realized I had become free of the shackles of the love I had for him had placed on my mind, heart, and soul. I could breathe again as I saw that this was how it was always going to end and for the first time, I was okay with it. The love, joy, hurt, pain, anger, and fear that had accompanied these long years was gone and replaced by a peace that I never thought I’d have. I was free, and it was beautiful.
