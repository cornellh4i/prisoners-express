**“The Player” by Jeremy Brown**

I’ve been watching this boy for ages. He’s an old school player. Every Friday he comes to this classy bar and with his swagger and smooth words always catched a young budding flower. She isn’t falling for it like the others. He may have money but she has more. In fact she ordered a damn water for god’s sake. He, only drinking half of his Don Perigon, thus’d assume he wasn’t here to drink either. She’s a gorgeous one isn’t she. Long fingers, slim limbs, very white teeth and quite modest for her bearing. When she smiles her whole face alights in joy and wonder. She’s a smart cookie. Not showing this old scallywag too much attention but just enough to level the playing field. He left elbow rests on the edge of the table which is body language for a quick getaway if need be. There is 4 and half feet between them. She’s definitely keeping her distance. I’m just the bartender, what do I know. Oh wait she arises and is coming my way now, I’m flustered.

“Hey Jeremy, give me a coke and rum on the double. Oh and I saw you studying us. But there’s no us, he's too old.”

“Well you caught me um . . .”

“Isabella’s my name, yet I never remain the same.”

“I see, well here’s your rum and coke on the triple my dear.”

“You’re a very respectable man, what say we get the hell out of here.”

“Yeah, screw this job it’s become a prison for me.”

“No need to worry my family has mucho moolah baby.”

“Well as long as you take care of me my girl I shall definitely care for you. I’m known to give an awesome massage.”

“I call that.”

A week later we were married. She was too good to just give up.

“I love you Isabella forever.”

“I too and too . . .”
