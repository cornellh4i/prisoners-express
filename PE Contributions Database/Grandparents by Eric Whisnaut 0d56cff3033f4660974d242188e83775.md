Untitled (Grandparents Theme Topic)

I never had all four grandparents. Just my dad’s mother and father, and my mom’s mother. My dad’s father was my favorite and only grandpa. His name was Leonard but everyone called him Hitler-- just because of the hell he raised, not because he was anything like the real Hitler.

I loved my Grandpa Leonard. I can remember as a kid asking him for $5.00 for the skating rink and he would huff and puff, cuss and grunt, then ask what happened to the $5.00 he gave me last month. (LOL) W.T.F?? That was gone a month ago. Even though he gave me hell he always spoiled me. He had a deep freezer full of ice cream only and they had every cake you could imagine and cookies on top of the refrigerator. Every house he had a pot belly stove in his bedroom. And his favorite past time was buy-sell-trade, and fixing up lawnmowers. So now when I smell wood burning in a house or see the Straton & Briggs motor sign I think of him. I was only 10 or 11 when he died. It was the first funeral I ever cried at. Man, I sure miss Hitler!

Now my mom’s mother was my favorite grandmother. Her name was Betty! And she helped raise me when I was little. She used to spoil me rotten. I can remember when her husband used to take her to work on the way to my school we would stop at the store and she *always* got a Pepsi, giant Sweet-Tarts, rainbow colored coconut candy, or a zero bar. And before she got out I got a piece of it all. That was a favorite thing we shared. I miss her so much! I remember when she would have a party at our house there would always be Rod Stewart playing when she got drunk. And we always ate K.F.C. chicken at least once a weekend. I was in jail when she passed away and when the chaplain came and told me I lost it. I never got to tell her bye or how much I loved her. My grandparents were and still are very important to me. I’d give anything to have them back. But maybe, just maybe when it’s all over we will meet again. Until then they will always be in my heart, thoughts, and prayers. R.I.P. grandparents.
