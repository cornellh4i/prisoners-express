**“Awe-Inspiring or Not?” by E.C. Theus-Roberts**

Like any writer worth the ink they bleed, I’m a voracious reader. Reading works by authors in and outside of my field is more than entertaining, it is research. Reading your contemporaries sharpens your skill set. Reading numerous authors widens your perspective and can introduce new approaches to old questions. I find it exciting when a writer words some phrase, describes some scene, or manipulates the plot in an unexpected way. It leaves me thinking, “well, that was cool! Now, how did they do it?” I’m certain you know the feeling.

A fellow writer recently asked me how I came up with my stories? Not the ideas but the “skin, meat, and bones” that go into a body of work. How do you explain the wild machinations of your imagination? Well, I explained it like this: I read.

To understand how to inspire that “awe-struck” feeling, I work in reverse. Take my awe-struck moment after reading “Hit List,” by Laurell K. Hamilton. Up against daunting odds, Anita Blake (the heroine), finds herself at the mercy of her enemies, but somehow manages to survive and triumph. Your first reading holds you spellbound. Hamilton is that good. In your second is when you “read like a writer.” breaking down the storyline, character development, places, length and construction of dialogue, how it contributes to the story, and how the author gets your attention invested in the story. Once you understand these you can start laying on muscles to your skeleton (the story idea), connecting ligaments and wrapping it all in skin.

My skeleton may be justice for crime victims. From here I’ll contemplate an ending that achieves my goal. After I know where I’m going, I can worry about how to get there. My ending is the skin and everything in between is muscle and ligaments. Without all of these connecting pieces all you’ve got is a bag of bones (an unfinished story).

When it comes to muscles, I rely on good solid action. Unless I’m in an experimental mood, I usually begin with action. Some conflict, collision, or problem: a woman screaming, persons arguing, etc. It grabs the reader, but it’ll also grab you. This is what I call “writing like a reader.” I allow the story to carry me however it appears in my head. From the Big Bang to the conclusion. I’ll write, describing the scenes as I imagine them. Then I’ll go over it several times because the initial story is normally quite terrible.

A process of toning and building my muscle (redrafting) is essential. During this process I’ll apply what I learned by reading like a writer. Dialogue, scenery, character development, plot, twists and turns, pace, flow, and sense of purpose. After it becomes readable, I distance myself. I need to read my story with fresh “reader” eyes. Another round of toning and building and then I’ll send it to some unsuspecting victim: my advance reader. If my advanced reader responds awe-struck then, I know I have a story ready for polishing before I start submissions. If not, well… I’ll go back over it, eventually…

But such is my formula for creating stories. After I’ve got a skeleton I’ll cover it in skin, slap on muscle and connective tissues. Give it some vital organs, never forget its heart. Send my body to the gym. Slim down here, bulk up there, get quicker, or move slower, etc. Check results: awe-inspiring or not?

If not, it’s back to the gym. If yes, then it’s shower time. Your work’s done for the moment.
