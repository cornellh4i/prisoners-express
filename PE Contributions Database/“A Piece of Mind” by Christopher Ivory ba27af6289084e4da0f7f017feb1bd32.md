**“A Piece of Mind” by Christopher Ivory**

****Everytime I get really upset, I look for a soothing view. Looking at this picture reminds me that nature is beautiful: the mountains, trees, and clouds in the sky. Looking at a soothing view while angry is something to do. This picture somehow helps me keep a peace of mind. If I ever went on vacation, it would be passing this place, probably on a train or in a car, and taking this picture. This picture relaxes my mind, and I think of nothing but Mother Nature and peace.
