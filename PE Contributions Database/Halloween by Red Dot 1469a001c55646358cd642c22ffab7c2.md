**"Halloween" by Red Dot**

I remember dressing up for Halloween and remember one year I had the Jason mask with the overalls and a hockey stick. I smacked a kid in the arm that was carrying his bag with so he dropped it, and I picked it up and ran home and changed into a superhero costume and went trick or treating with the family. I was diving down the hill like a superhero. We had to watch what we got because there was a scare of people putting stuff in the candy. But I used to have so much fun on Halloween going door-to-door trick or treating and getting candy, and I’m going to go out when I get out. Now it is so much fun doing your costumes; there’s an art to it. That’s why I love it; it’s not only for little kids, anyone can trick or treat.
