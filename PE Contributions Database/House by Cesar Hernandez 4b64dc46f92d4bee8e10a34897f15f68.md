**House by Cesar Hernandez**

Some people are highly skilled at flattering and complimenting others. In particular, people in positions of power often have obsequious aides who cater to all their likes and dislikes, singing their praises. Such flattery may be appealing to vain or insecure people, but those who are wise feel uncomfortable with such treatment.

A young woman who has just graduated from college is on a train home while waiting to find a job. She is eager to go home again but also wonders about her future. At one station, a woman in plain clothes holding a baby gets on and sits in the empty seat beside her. After exchanging glances, the woman starts a conversation.

“Young lady, you look like you were born into a very well-educated family. You must be a scholar or doctor.”

“No, I just got my bachelor’s degree.”

“In any case, I envy you. Actually, I wanted to go to college when I was younger, but my family was so poor I could only go to school for a couple of days. I can’t even write my own name. It makes me sad. Later I started a small business and made some money. Friends advised me to start another company, but I’m afraid I’ll be tricked, because I have no real business knowledge. Right now I’m going to the city to sign a contract. Could you please help me? I will pay all your expenses. I have money and clearly you are very intelligent and bound for success.”

Feeling flattered, the college graduate agrees. The woman invites her to get off the train with her and makes a phone call. She says, “you must be tired, let’s rest at my aunt’s house.”

They take a bus and arrive at a village in the suburbs. Walking into a high-walled courtyard, they are led to the house by the master, a middle-aged man. After a short conversation, he gives the woman a pack of something. Then the woman tells her, “Please, make yourself at home. I’ll be back in a minute.”

The young woman waits, but the woman never returns. In fact the woman was luring and selling people. She had sold the girl to that middle-aged man as his wife. Later, the college graduate manages to escape and tells everyone about her traumatic experience.

Nowadays some people aren’t careful when making friends. They are lured in by smooth words and empty promises. Later they lament, “I was so naive! I didn’t know!” Don’t let flattery blind you and impair your judgement.
