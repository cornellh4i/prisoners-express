**“When Life Gives You Crap Make Sandwiches” by Anthony Kenley**

If you’re going to have to swallow it anyway you might as well make the best of it.

When I was thirteen my dad went to prison. Okay. choices when life gives me crap. 1. Blame the world and become another piece of crap pleasuring the world in my self pity. 2. Get on with life as I want it to be. Grab two pieces of bread and choke it down and keep changing.

I chose number 2. I went to live with my grandparents. I graduated highschool and joined the Army. I made sandwiches instead of swallowing life’s messed up offerings as they were.

I have the Army and have to take a job as a mall janitor. My training didn’t translate well to a real world job. Now life is loading on the crap with a shovel. I actually drive a 300.00 dollar car every day. I’m working as a janitor. The mall sent me to sweeper truck school, so I got my certification as an operator. I’m making sandwiches.

I saved my money and pawned my car to rent a truck to take my CDL license test.

I hired on at a national trash company as a driver. They put me on the rear of a residential truck as a loader. No driving. Boy, crap is still rolling in.

I’m allowed to train on commercial trash trucks on my free time. I’m steadily making sandwiches.

I love that job and have to start over at another at half my salary. I was just desperate for a job because of family responsibilities. Whoo! I’m getting my fill of life’s sandwiches. I’m telling you. I move from delivery driver all the way up to assistant manager at that job. I’m eating pretty well now and there aren’t any sandwiches in my diet.

I catch this case and now I’m in prison. I’m having to eat a huge pile from the bottom up. Oh, and there is a shortage of bread too!

I’ve used this time to become a much better person. I’ve used this time to learn, learn, learn. One big thing I’ve learned is even when life gives you crap, you don’t have to take it. Go hunting for something better. You’ll nearly always find it.
