**Decisions, Decisions by Edward Cortez Williams**

Mintya the Etzi peered at the wild plant. She was trying to decide whether or not to eat it. If she wanted to eat it, she would have to call her sister Grashya so they could share. Normal little girls would not dare to eat random flowers, but Mintya was an Etzi, a plant-girl, or whatever else the humans called them. Etzis could eat any plant matter they wanted, be it shrubs, sticks or trees, and it would all taste good to them. Surely this flower would be a tasty treat, too.

Mintya’s skin was usually a spearmint green, but she had munched on some Locoloro berries earlier, so she looked like a caucasian youth. Mintya had no fondness for the terms “white” and “black” when it came to skin color, for the “white” and “black” Ishes (humans) were quite clearly not white and black, but were rather obviously shades of pink and red, pale butterscotch and cottage cheese, light and dark brown. Couldn’t they see their own colors?

Mintya still couldn’t decide whether or not to eat the plant. After all, most of the plants on this planet were GOOD, but they weren’t quite RIGHT. This planet’s organisms were greatly corrupted and they even DIED on their own! Without someone eating them! How weird! But if she just waited twenty minutes, the super Ish would return and take them back to planet Etzi, a place where the plants lived forever, or at least until you ate them. Planet Etzi was far, far away and the food was much better. But maybe she could sow some seeds real quick after eating it.

Eh… well… she guessed she’d have a snack.

“Oh, Grashya!” Came her tinkling voice.
