**“Peer Pressure” by Richard Watts**

****“I’m scared,” Kim said. “I don’t know if I can do this.” She had always listened to other people, but this time she was unsure. “What will it make me?” Everyone always told her to embrace her other side. To fit in, she needed to become stronger. She was too kind-hearted for this world. “But what if my other self is evil or corrupt? How can I be sure that I will remain the same person?” They all laughed at her question. They told her to grow up. Everything will be the same; everyone does it--don’t be a chicken.

Kim finally gives in and commits… She sits and waits on a bed in the prepared room. She is nervous. She starts to get up to leave, but the door slowly swings open, causing her to stop from running away. Mystified, Kim watches as another girl silently enters the room. The newcomer looks to be her twin image: her other self has the same soft features and kind-eyes as her. The other walks over to the bed. Once there, she asks, “Is this the world you really want?”

“... Y-yes…” Kim hesitates. “I believe so…” Without another word, the other girl sits down next to Kim. Slowly, she braids their hair together. Soon, a warm feeling builds as the braids folded in place. The warmth creeped over kim. Suddenly, it was as if a floodgate busted open. Before, unknown thoughts played through Kim’s mind, thoughts that she never even dreamt people had. Envy! Jealousy! Hate!

Kim screams, “No! … No… This is horribly wrong!” She reaches to stop the other girl’s hands. To Kim’s horror, when their hands connected, they stuck together. Without pause, their fingers entwined and merged together just as their braids. WIth a mocking, half-evil grin, the other girl says, “It’s too late… You are no longer yourself… There is no going back.”

With new founded rage, Kim realized it was all lies! Everything they told her was a lie. *I was to stay the same--a lie.* *I would be able to control my other self--all lies!*

They pushed her and told her it would be OK. Why? Why did she listen. Why did she give in. Kim’s last thoughts from her original self were now past. All she thought now was to get ahead or to get even with those who lied. Everyone, everything changed because she could not say no. Can you?!
