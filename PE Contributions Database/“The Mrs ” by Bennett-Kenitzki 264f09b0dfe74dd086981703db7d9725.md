**“The Mrs.”** **by Bennett-Kenitzki**

There’s nothing like the comfort of a warm, soft, hair dog on my lap. Love. Unabandoned. Adoration. Happiness in all capital letters.

The wet nose.

The soft brown eyes.

The fuzzy face with cold ears and a warm heart filling this four-legged lover of my friendship, fills my soul with compassion.

Has she been waiting for me all day? You bet!

Has she laid faithfully all night at my feet when I work late- You bet!

Has she kept my spot in the bed warm while I use the bathroom in the middle of the night - sure!

I would have to fight her for that spot back, with a low growl, and a yielding whimper.

The short legs and long leaps on a snowy landscape.

The long runs across the grass in the Spring or through leaves in the Fall.

How about across the sandy beach in Summer where she’d dive to the bottom of the lake, or river to retrieve a rock I’d thrown in.

I remember the look on her face when she smelled the load on our first baby’s diaper. She looked at me in an anthropomorphic interpretation of disgust, as if to say “I’m not allowed to do that inside.”

From early on, as a pup, I will always choose you from the others of a litter.

Even today as you lay your head on my lap I try hard not to think about life without your head to pet, ears to scratch, or cold wet nose on my hand.

As I left her at the house, with the family that once gave her to mine, there’s a panic in those soft, brown eyes that I shan’t ever forget.

As I leave her there for the first time ever leaving her anywhere outside of our car for 9 years, I cry.

I shut the door, but I don’t say good-bye.

I’d hoped to see her again in 5 years. (That didn’t happen.)

For the first 2 weeks that’s where she lay, by their front door. As every car approached she would stand up to see if it was me.

When it wasn’t she’d laid back down to wait.

They took her to the vet because she hadn’t eaten since I left and gave her an I.V.

Soon enough she learned to love, again, the family that once gave her to mine. Loving her back while I went to prison.
