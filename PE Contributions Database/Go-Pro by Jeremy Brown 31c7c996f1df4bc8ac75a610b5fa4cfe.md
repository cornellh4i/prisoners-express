**Go-Pro by Jeremy Brown**

Well you see he never actually made it into the cave. A few weeks prior I had placed a go-pro camera on a bear I tranquilized for research purposes. I was in the process of figuring out what bears actually did while in stasis or hibernation. Well, they eat a lot beforehand. The man was torn to shreds. On a positive note however, local authorities were called immediately. Only the arms and legs were consumed. The man escaped with his life and we all had dinner with his family once he was out of the hospital. For dinner we had the bear. Vengeance was all his. On Halloween Tom dressed as a bowling pin. The laughter prevents him from reclusive melancholy.
