**“Long To Short” by Anthony S. Romero**

July, 2003- I was released from the Texas Youth Commission (T.Y.C) and as soon as I entered the city, I went to my negative influences in my life. I was 17, lean and fit, and just wanted to have fun.

Summer as usual, is hot and humid back home but that didn’t stop me from running in the street while still on juvenile parole. That summer and into my senior year in high school, there was only a few thoughts in my head: money, selling drugs, robberies, and sex ( I’m grateful for not catching any diseases and amazingly, I didn’t procreate).

To a certain big degree, you can call me egotistical because for the most part, it was all about me, especially since it was my senior year, so that meant partying until school was over.

Everyday, it seemed like it would take forever for the school bell to ring; I was always worried about the activities of the street life over the educational opportunities that I could have taken advantage of.

Since I was young, I was always helped, encouraged and lectured by certain school officials, who really wanted the best for me and took the time and consideration to mentor me the best that they could.

Me being me, I didn’t care for a high school diploma and everyday, I just wanted that stupid bell to ring so I could go running wild in the concrete jungle.

Even though my last year went by faster than the others, I still didn’t look forward to finishing; nothing there caught my attention besides the girls.

Everyday after four, I would hit the gym, selling drugs, and when night came by, it was time for a robbery. The hooking up with women happened in the times in between. Occasionally, my friends and I would get into fights with other groups, but that was nothing new with people from my barrio (neighborhood).

The only one who talked any sense in me was my uncle and we had planned to go take a vocational trade together at the local community college. Unfortunately, I did not make it nor did I graduate my senior year. All the good times came to a halt the minute I got caught in a stolen SUV by a swarm of police officers. I almost stayed out for seven months.

This seemed like a long time compared to the 14 years I’ve done in the Institute of Corrections. Now, I see how fast, how short time really is. Little cousins now have families and established households- nephews and nieces going to the same schools that I went to. Talking about dances, Iphones, or having just graduated. I missed out on the things that I will never experience with them, when I should of been there for them in their youth while their fathers were locked up.

It seems like every five years that passes, time speeds up its flow and I hear a lot of people talk about how when they get out, they’re gonna catch up with time. It’s sad because that’s just an illusion- we can’t catch what’s gone. All one can do upon release, is catch and live in the moment.

Every year, there’s people here who are committing suicide or attempting, some are losing it mentally, some get called to the Chaplain’s office to hear about a dead relative. There’s a lot of hate and sorrow here and the staff could care less.

I learned years ago that one should be patient because an instant reaction to the first thought that pops inside your head can have drastic results that you may not be ready for/ or you may not want. A lot of the time, what one gets incarcerated for is not worth the time spent.

It took me a while to learn certain teachings that I used to not believe in or that I would cast aside, but the main thing I have learned is to not worry about the problem but to know how you are gonna move forward in a better, more prosperous way.

LIfe’s too short to cry over the petty things. There’s bigger things to fix and life is bigger than me and you. We can either build one another up, or fall down faster than a blink of an eye.
