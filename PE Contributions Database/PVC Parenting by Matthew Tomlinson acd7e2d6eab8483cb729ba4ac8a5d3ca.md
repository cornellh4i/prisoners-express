**“PVC Parenting” by Matthew Tomlinson**

****Parental oversight could have prevented a recent train derailment. That high-speed passenger train was traveling 80 miles an hour in Washington State. Tacoma area track speed limit was 30 miles an hour. The train entered a curve and derailed. A system called Positive Train Control (PTC) could have circumvented this deadly catastrophe. PTC could have sensed an overspeed event and then turned off the locomotive. So says the news media, anyhow.

Congress needs to exercise its parental oversight. Congress should mandate research into Positive Vehicle Control (PVC) for cars. Crazy conduct like driving 80 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone in a curve, no less could be countermanded. The PVC system could turn off the car. The PVC system would need to be designed so that only a cap could wirelessly reset the system. Download of PVC data would document where the overspeed event took place. The speeding fine plus the PVC reset fee along with punitive excise taxes would be electronically paid before the vehicle moved. Parenting an unsafe driver could generate fines, fees, and taxes. Like barbed wire, PVC could keep a cat safely within bounds.

Parental oversight has already proven its potential. Ankle monitors track movements of criminals. That generates an income stream for monitoring companies. Parental oversight can be profitable. Criminals are cash cows waiting to be milked dry. Extra layers of financial barbed wire could keep a cat within bounds. For criminals who have no moral values, Positive Values Control could parent them. Fines, fees, and excise taxes could feed a family of industries. Manufacturers of ankle monitors would profit. Parental monitoring companies would make money by “riding herd” on client criminals. The installation and maintenance of these Positive Values Control systems would make many dollars as well as good moral sense.

The potentials of parental oversight need to be soberly measured. Rebellion Against Parenting (RAP) is an underground economy ready to emerge. Sooner or later any cat will tire of the barbed wire of a PVC system. Spoofing any GPS receiver already is a common sport. False data transmitted on 1575.42 MHZ will cause any GPS receiver to say you’re “Over There” when in reality you’re “Right Here” basking in the sunshine, encircled with barbed wire. Look on the Internet to find out how GPS spoofing is done. Parental monitoring companies would assume the Positive Values Control system was accurate. The client criminal’s ankle monitor would prove he was at church. The spoofing PVC client could instead be Pulling Vicious Crimes. Any client criminal would cough up considerable cash to be able to spoof an alibi. To beat this Rebellion Against Parenting (RAP), the parental monitoring companies must be prepared to engage in counter-spoofing. Counter-spoofing is a Revenue Adjustment Technique (RAT). Client criminals who are spoofing off are damaging the revenue of the parental monitoring companies. RAP costs them money. To beat the RAP, counter-spoofing RAT Patrols need to be ready to verify that the cat is, in fact, where his ankle monitor reports. The confrontations between RAP clients and the RAT Patrols will generate fines, fees for RAT Patrol service, and punitive excise taxes.

Positive Values Control systems need to be studied. Sufficient layers of financial barbed wire could keep any cat within bounds. PVC parenting could shepherd us all toward a safer, more just society. We all could spend more time basking in the sunshine, safely surrounded by plenty of protective barbed wire.
