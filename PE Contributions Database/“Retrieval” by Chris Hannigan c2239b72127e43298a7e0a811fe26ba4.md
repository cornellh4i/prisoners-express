**“Retrieval” by Chris Hannigan**

****It started with the ash falling from the sky. They called it the grey rain. They had known it was coming, but it was always in the future, someone else’s problem, and then one day, the future became the present. No one was prepared for what it brought. Sure, there were people with their bunkers and months of food stored, but none of that was enough to see them through the disasters.

The rains moved, and some areas were drowning as others were dry as a bone. The lightning still came. The government was able to handle the first few fires that broke out, but the resources were quickly stretched too thin and dwindled. More and more land burned, and firefighters consigned whole swathes of land to the flames.

The great clouds of smoke standing over towns engulfed in flames carried the ashes of civilization high up into the air. There, they met with the jet stream which carried the grey particles to every corner of the globe. As the ash spread, it began to rain down, and it appeared as if a giant blanket had been thrown over the earth. Its very being poisoned all it touched, clogging up the streets and rivers and burying the ground.

Once again, humanity made an exodus, only this time in reverse and back to the birthplaces from whence it came. The endless stream of people marched to the lands drowned with water where the fires couldn’t burn. The reddish orange glow of the flames reflected by the clouds of ash lit their way as dark, billowing columns of smoke rose in the background like the fingers of the hand of hell come to snatch them down to its fiery pits.

Soon after the people made their march to the distant lands, the gangs made their appearance. Hyenas preyed on the weak and those stupid enough to think they could outlast nature’s fury. Thousands of lives were put to the toil to eke out an existence for the privileged few in the barren wastelands. They were put in chains and staked out in the desert, made to dig holes searching for water or to cultivate gardens of the few surviving desert plants.

Every now and then, one would get it in its head to shake off its leash and run. And that’s where I would come in, sent to retrieve those that escaped. Most of the time, it wasn’t hard to do. A starving bag of bones can’t get very far out in the wastelands without any water and dragging chains. Usually, you could find them the next morning a few miles away, dead.

But the last time, no. The last time was different.

He (I told you it was a he, not that it really mattered much) was staked three days out into the wastelands. Late teens, brown hair, brown eyes, nothing special about him. I figured he shouldn’t be too hard to find, especially because not too many guys walked around the wastelands dragging a chain around their neck. Go out, find him, bring him back (preferably alive). Just another job.

I got my gear and set out on a 450cc Honda 4-stroke dirt bike with an extra gallon of gas. Finding gas wasn’t hard: all the old gas station tanks underground were close to full, and a map of how things were before the disasters showed where to find all the stations. I also had a tent to keep sun the off me during the day, a mask to filter out the ash and dust, a double barrel shotgun with plenty of ammo, and most importantly, a week’s worth of water.

I opened the throttle wide and rushed out to where they said he had been staked. I could waste fuel on this run because of plenty of stations in between. Time and water, though, were my enemies. They said they wanted him alive, but there’s not much chance of that if he’s wandering the wasteland on his own for three days. The bike ate up the ground, carving a trail throughout the mounds of ash. Stopping only for short breaks or a quick nap, I managed to make a three day trip in 36 hours.

I spent the next six days looking for him. At first, it was easy given the clear tracks in the ash and sand to follow. I had seen only one set of footprints leading away from the stake, which had to be his, and I figured he was carrying the chain. However, the second day out, the winds blew a wall of dust and ash high enough to block out the sun for hours and erased everything on the ground. His tracks wandered back and forth but always headed east. When the winds died away, I set out opposite the setting sun, hoping to see signs.

Three days later, I picked up his trail again. I don’t know how he managed it: after the dust storm, I had to ration my water. He had gone seven days with what little he had saved or the little he managed to find. The chain around his neck must have grown too heavy to carry anymore, but the trail it left, dragging behind him, was a road beckoning to me.

I found him the next morning, and to make sure it wasn’t easy for me, he managed to make it into another gang’s territory. And that is why I always carried the shotgun. They didn’t give me any trouble because it’s not worth it for a run away, especially one half dead.

My remaining water barely got us along, until we came across a watering team. I got him back alive, just as I was told. When I dumped him on the flood at their feet… laughter. You ask why they laughed. So did I.

“We bet the son could outlast his old man.”

When I tell you to go, pull on the chain and be ready to run with me.
