It was my second day of my LA vacation in the 2005 holidays, ready to head home the next day. I picked a seedy gas station/convenience store in downtown Anaheim, California to wash my car that had a car wash machine. Five bucks! No problem...

Until I find the red and green indicators are not functioning once I finish entering my code into the keypad! Thus, slowly I move my car ahead until I hear the machine starts to operate. I quickly shift into “park” and apply the breaks. Only to find I had positioned my car wrong; a little bit too backward and CRACK! The car wash bristle contraption smacks the upper part of the window.

The car wash machine detects an accident and up goes the bristle contraption. Damn it! I look at my watch/cell phone: 4:32 PM. Double damn it! I race back to the hotel and search for an auto glass shop and call them. I race to the highway to find...traffic! By the time I reach the appropriate exit it is 4:52 PM! *The shop closed before I got there.* GREAT!

Then I see a raggedy sign: *Auto Glass!* I am discouraged by the seediness of this establishment and the model of car I have, a ‘97 Chrysler Sebring Convertible. They wouldn’t have a windshield for my car! Impossible! I pull into the establishment, a broken down old house and a junkyard.

The owner greets me and I tell him what I need; he makes a call...*success*! It is A MIRACLE! $125 he says! And an hour of work. While the work is in progress, I go to a deli up the street, ATM withdraw $200, eat a sandwich. Go back...his eight year old son and the owner are hard at work, RESCUING MY CAR! *Thank you!*

You’ll never know when a miracle will appear when you’re in a bind like I was! Carefully planned by your guardian angels. Once miracles happen once in your life it is a catalyst for more miracles to come to rescue you, and I have counted two after this miracle. All it takes is the belief that miracles do happen.
