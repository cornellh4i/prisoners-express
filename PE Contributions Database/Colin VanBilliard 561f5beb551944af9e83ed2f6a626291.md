Funny as it sounds, but working at the Department of Correctional Services programs was my first job. I worked in the mess hall where I served food. Then I went to the yard porter and had to sweep and keep weights on the mats. Then I took school (physical education) and learned about working out and safety. Then I worked in the gym, cleaning showers and hallways. Food service, washed pans and learned about food. Porter in a block. Custodial maintenance and learned about floors. Printing I loved the most because we had a computer we could type with, and I would type my poems and stories. This is when I firsted started writing, and it was so much fun. It kept me hungry to learn and write more. Guess I took a bad predicament and turned it into something good. My job now is staying alive. Iâ€™m on my job, writing and thinking about papers. D.O.C.S. saved me my first job.
