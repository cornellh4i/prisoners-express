**A Close Call By Marco A. Williams**

Walking down the street on a beautiful summer day, in Detroit, along Plymouth Road when I was a 17 year old pseudo tough guy. I had a lot of bark back then but very little bite. Yet, back then my street name was “crazy.” And people knew that I couldn’t fight well, but they rarely messed with me because I was the kind of kid that if you wronged me in any way, I would wait you out and then get you with a brick, rebar, on 2x4 when you least expected it.

However, on this particular day, I was just going to the corner store to get me and my daughter a few “Laffy Taffy’s” to snack on. This day was one of those laid back summer days in Detroit where everyone is out sitting on porches and taking leisurely strolls up and down the street. But no one was actually doing anything. No touch football or basketball sessions in progress. Some sporadic laughter but nothing that sounds like a gathering. Nevertheless, someone decided to shatter the tranquil camaraderie of the day by trying to kill me.

As I approached the store, I noticed a dark blue 79 Montecarlo ‘55 slowing down and nearing the curb as if it was about to park in front of the corner store. However, as I realized a moment later, this was not their intent.

I was briefly oblivious to the car, as my mind just perceived it as on-coming traffic, until someone yelled,

“Yo, CRAZY”

From the passenger seat of the Montecarlo. As I looked to see who was yelling my name I noticed that. He was bringing something up lap, and me being very street wise, instinct took over when I saw the dark gray tube of metal rise to point in my direction. I knew at that moment that I was in trouble.

In my mind, I couldn’t figure out who it was or why they were aiming a gun at me or who it was or why they were trying to kill me. A myriad of thoughts swam through my mind. As these thoughts were swimming through my conscious mind my subconscious was taking over my body. I dodged right and then I ran left toward oncoming traffic. Which was in the opposite direction in which the assailant car was pointed.

There was a cacophony of sound all around me. I was in mental turmoil. I experienced a mind-body disconnect. All thoughts were separate and simultaneous. I devolved into an animal state for a split second that seemed like hours. And for the moment, I thought life was at its end for me.

Until I came back to my present sense and noticed that I was running. So I ran faster. And bullets kept coming. I ran faster than I have ever ran up until that point in my life. Yet I was hit. Then hit again. But I didn’t stumble or fall. I ran along the front of the apartment building next to the corner store. The end seemed miles away. I was struggling to make it to the end so I could round the corner and be out of harm’s way.

I made it to the corner followed by a hail of bullets. I cut a left at the corner then another left into the alley behind the apartment to a friend’s house. I made my way through their yard to their back door and began pounding on it yelling for them to open up and that I was just shot at. And that I believe was hit.

They let me in seeing the blood on my face and neck they quickly rushed me to the bathroom to clean me up and check my wounds.

As it turned out, I was not shot. I caught some brick shrapnel from the bullets impacting with the buildings facade that was embedded in my head and neck. Very small pieces. But scars that I still have nearly 30 years later.

After I was cleaned up, I went back to my mother’s home to check on my daughter and to let my mother know what happened and to make some phone calls, strangely I did not feel any fear what I felt was rage.

After I informed my mother as to what transpired, she wanted to get the family involved. Which entails getting pony down involved (pony down was a ruling class family gang that controlled the westside of detroit in the early 60’s 70’s and 80’s to which I am related to). And I said “No mom, we can handle this on our own. I don’t want war.”

My phone calling came up with no leads. So when it was dark, I went back-out and asked people around the neighbors if they knew who those guys were. And to my surprise, everyone heard about the shooting of course, but some people actually knew the guys that shot at me and the car they drove. My thoughts were only on revenge and why.

I found that they lived in Southwest Detroit. Which we call Latin town or Spanish town. Because of all of the Spanish speaking people who migrated there, and I found a mutual acquaintance of ours to get us to meet about a week after the incident. To get to the bottom of this.

As it turned out, I was the wrong “crazy.” They wanted the “crazy” that lived off Meyers and Plymouth Road. I stayed a mile and a half down West of Plymouth road off Hubble. And someone pointed me out they knew my name was “crazy,” so they almost killed the wrong guy.

And since they almost killed me for reasons unknown I was allowed to fight all three of them one by one. Because I asked if I could. And to my greatest delight neither of them could fight well or it was my rage guided me, and I won all three fights.

I was so filled with rage that day. To be nearly killed by accident. Through mistaken identity because someone had the same name as mine. So instead of verifying their info, they’d just decided to start shooting. And I still didn’t find out why I was being shot at. No one ever told me why I was going to be killed. Talk about a close call.

That just goes to show that some things are accidents and some are close calls.
