**Untitled by Cesar Hernandez**

Spiritual growth can be experienced just like anything else. You may have experienced a time in your life when you felt a lot of negativity, anger, and resentment. You know how that feels, and you know how you feel toward others when you are feeling that way. You know how your heart feels, and you know what your thoughts and actions are like. You know that space. It’s not a philosophy; it’s a direct experience.

If you grow past that part of you, over time you will actually drift away from the feelings of tension and anxiety. The entire cloud of lower vibrations will appear further and further away from where you sit inside. The could may still be there, but if you don’t identify with it, or hold onto it, it can no longer hold onto you. As you release the lower vibrations, you naturally stop thinking they’re you or that there’s anything you have to do about them. As you let go of them, your spirit drifts upward.

How do you know your spirit drifts upward? You know the same way you know that you are breathing, the same way that you have thoughts. You are in there and you directly experience it.

What does it mean to drift upward? It’s an experience of being drawn further back inside yourself. You are no longer held down to your earthly self, so you begin to feel more spaciousness inside. You feel that there’s more of a distance between you and the thoughts and emotions inside of you. You drift back, and then in and up.

How how does it feel when you drift up? You don’t feel as much anger, fear, or self-consciousness. You don’t feel resentment toward people. Things still happen that you don’t want to happen, but they don’t seem to touch you as much. They can’t reach back to where you are because you are drifted behind the these are actual experiences, not merely something you were told about. It’s just what naturally happens when you let go of the lower vibrations of your being. You drift in and up to the deeper vibrations.

Where are you going? Even if you have no basis for understanding what is happening to you, you are still having the undeniable experience of going somewhere. What you begin to feel is that you are going into your spiritual being. As you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy.

What does it feel like to identify more with spirit than with form? You used to walk around feeling anxiety and tension; now you walk around feeling love. You just feel love for no reason. Your backdrop is love, openness, beauty, and appreciation. You don’t have to make yourself feel that way; that is how spirit feels. If you were asked how the body normally feels, you might say that ‘t;s generally uncomfortable about one thing or another. How about the psyche? If you were being totally honest, you’d probably say that it’s generally full of complaints and fears. How does spirit normally feel? It always feels good. It always feels high. It always feels open and light.

Because of this, you naturally begin to center more and more on the spiritual part of your being. You do this not by reaching for spirit, but by letting go of the rest. There is no other way. The personal self cannot touch spirit; you must release the personal self. As you realize it, you drift back. As you go further back, you get higher. You get higher in vibration and higher in the amount of love and lightness that you feel. You just begin to soar. This happens in an ever-increasing, continuous progression.
