**"Fear" by Darnell Ballard**

I sit here and look at the picture of people running from the terror in their country. The fear of the smallest noise giving away their position. It reminds me of the fear of my childhood. The fear when the next beating would come from a drunken father. The fear that if I did something wrong it would make it worse.

One day my window was broken in the middle of the night by a beer bottle thrown through it by an unknown vigilante. After that day, whenever my father came home drunk I would slowly pull the nailed board from the window. Every time a nail made a noise, I nearly passed out in fright. The worst fear was that when I finished crawling through the hole in the window that my father would be waiting there for me to beat my face in for running.

When I turned seven, I was saved by my aunt and uncle...or I thought I was. For the next five years, I would face abuse from them and eight different foster homes before being adopted by the family I have now in 2012.

How does one overcome such fear? It is unknown to me. I look at such idols as Oprah and Dave Pelzer and wonder how they were able to let such fear and hatred go. How were they able to turn it into what they have today?

I sit in a prison cell trying to contemplate the physical and mental determination it must have taken and I am lost. I am 25 years old and I try everyday to forgive those that hurt me. I try to forgive those that left external and internal scars on my body and just canâ€™t.

Now my life is scarred by: PTSD, antisocial disorder, bipolar and split personality disorder. All for living with that fear and not learning how to forgive and trust again.

Fear is the ultimate abuse. It does more damage than any human could do.
