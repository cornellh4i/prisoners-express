**“Emerging From the Fog” by Cesar Hernandez**

My best friend and I flew to a party at a mansion. She would not tell me how she was invited or who invited her. Most importantly, she would not tell me why she absolutely had to attend this party. She finally convinced me after telling me this mansion would probably have lots of runway and bikini models.

Me agreeing to go with her was a foregone conclusion. She already had all the arrangements done. She handed me the invitation and some Calvin Klein shopping bags. The invitation was very fancy and looked like it cost twenty dollars to make. The dress code was all white attire. In the bag was a white Calvin Klein suit, shirt, shoes, socks, and boxers.

Flying is such a hassle. I noticed there was a heavy fog when the plane took off. When we landed there was light fog at the airport. We picked up a white Dodge charger rental car. We checked into our suite at the Hilton. My best friend wore a white Calvin Klein dress that looked very good on her.

We pull up to the mansion that has valet parking. This white mansion was valued at just slightly under five million dollars. This nine bedroom mansion sits on the tropical shore of Sarasota Bay. It has a 1,200 bottle wine room, white oak floors, marble fireplaces, and two elevators. A 65 foot balcony overlooks the water. The 2.4 acre property features a koi pond, a 125 foot private dock with boatlift, and a pool with a spa. My best friend had plenty of details of the mansion yet would still not tell me anything of the party itself.

There were lots of people in attendance. There definitely were plenty of girls who probably were bikini models. In fact, all the waitresses were girls in white bikinis. There was lots of food and every possible type of alcohol you could think of. At the party I quickly noticed there were all kinds of drugs flowing. I told my best friend to closely watch her drink and not take anything that wasn’t poured out of a new bottle. She wanders off.

About twenty minutes later my best friend leads me to the bathroom. She says we can leave the party now. She hands me a Sandisk computer thumb drive on a lanyard. She tells me to put it around my neck and not lose it. She still won’t give me any details about what this whole party is about. I don’t want to leave since we have been here less than an hour and there are too many perfect tens at the party.

I meet Serena who is a perfect ten. We are having a great conversation and plenty of vodka. One of the waitresses tells me my best friend is in the bathroom vomiting. When I see her I think somebody put something in her drink. It is time for us to leave the party.

I am mad at my best friend for allowing something to be slipped in her drink. At the same time she wanted to leave three hours earlier. I put the computer drive in the suite safe.

I put her down on the cold marble floor in our suite. I got some apple juice from the mini bar and pour it on the floor next to her. When she wakes up she’ll think she urinated on the floor. I know she’ll be mad about me not putting her in bed so I sleep on the rug.

We both wake up about the same time. She sees the “urine” and tries to clean it up before I wake up. I tell her it is not lady like to pee on the floor and she turns bright red with embarrassment. I don’t tell her it’s apple juice. She did not ever tell me why she had to pick up that computer drive at the party. All she would tell me was her boss paid all the expenses which was about five thousand dollars.
