**“Person Sitting On Dock” by Terry Lytle**

So...how am I to explain this to everybody? And will they understand me, what I’m saying? Because, really, it’s not them---or me--- that’s done this. With over 30 years of jail and prison, I still feel as if I’m sitting on a pier, alone.

My life’s kinda like this, too, you know? I’m either in the water---or not. Even though I’m sitting up here on this pier dry as the sun-setting, cloud sky...my skin’s a waterlogged wrinkle, like old man’s hands. Never mind the work they’ve done---picking corn ears, cropping tobacco leaves until I was too sick to go on...building houses and decks, too, come to think of it. And shingles; there wasn’t a man with a nailgun faster than me, for a time. But all these years, dry-swimming with the sharks...that’s what really done it. Not even pure vaseline can help the dry skin, the wrinkling. It’s as if I’ve done 30 years of work, and not wasted 30, being idle. In the belly of a beast…

See that valley way back yonder? It’s a separator; God’s own natural design. Tis how I feel---separated, you know? I was either knee-deep in the valley---or above it, maybe on one of those hills. Kind of like that horizon there...it’s either fog or clouds. Never was much of a clear sky atop of me. And when there was? Why, it was just as blue as a country tune, snatching them damn tears right out of your eyes. Oh. And the rain---when it came---was sloppier and muddier than any dirt upon my hands. Not even blood was as thick.

It’s like I said---I was damn near drowning, or drier than a pinestraw as brown as my skin. Imagine! White boy like me, mistaken for a Mexican, I worked so hard under that scorching sun. Yellow-blonde hair turned brown, and ice-blue eyes turnt grey...and I don’t even know, was it the sun---or the years I weathered, inside.

And life’s still the same to me. You’re either right, or wrong. Good, or no good. Either you’re a thief, or you’re not. But who gives a good shit-damn about my not stealing for over 20 years? Sure as hell ain’t no corrections departments, let me tell ya...done changed its name, I’ve been in there so long: “Department of Public Safety” they call it---and them that run it, in cahoots with them terrorist groups called gangs, ten ways from Sunday!

So how the hell am I to explain this to my family? The kids? I ain’t got but one myself---but it’s a lot of nieces and nephews, and great nieces and nephews, who think this “outlaw” stuff is all movies. And even though I’m born and somewhat raised in Arizona, I don’t know how to even start talking with all these youngins born and raised in this here “dirty south.” Why, these racist crackers is still stuck in the Jim Crow 50’s! I’ve been out here since the 80’s, and there just ain’t no way to tell my nieces and nephews, that their racist-ass daddies, is wrong. Them knowing that their daddy won’t never hardly there just isn’t gonna be enough! It’s like a damn ole Merle Haggard song---or Johnny Cash even: they “had to be there”, to comprehend.

Look at that water: like the two hollow eyes of a skull, the pier mimicking the heads of death and skills I see everywhere. Psychotic?! Doc, you don’t know the first thing about altered states. Is it black water, or blue? And what about that “figure”, way back there in the clouds: is it a demon, or an angel?

I think I’ll sit here, and wait on ‘im. Maybe he’ll have a painter or two...
