**Rescued by James Hunter**

Has my best communication been broadcast among narrow minds? The past path less worn is also the one one with less risk of being discovered. The next best writer is very much aware of this. The pause button seems to be a time of growth during any age. Race is what cars do. The maintenance record is an autobiography of each number of the vehicle. How many miles has he or she traveled on wheel or feet? O, do not try to compare automobiles to humans. They are much too different, and yet similar. How should my son feel in the arms of an angel? His beautiful mother is an angel. She cried real tears at his birth. He will forever be rescued and protected by the shield of hope, faith, and love. When she makes her appearance everybody is going to recognize the color she wears. He always must remember her gentle loving arms and soft touch. Time is so short on this planet. People fail so often before the final winning game. Time after time losers, failures, loss of value recipients. Count all of my diplomas, certificates, awards, trophies, prizes. How much actual time was spent to illustrate with words, symbols, signs, etc? Ten minutes is all the audience gets; doesn’t seem like enough. Why would the girl with the American flag draped over her casket say these words? She stole my social security and all of my childhood fine arts. All I’ve worked for all my life. Socialism is software, harddrive is communism, computer languages. Democracy is a racecar game demonstration with very few winners.

Desperation, anxiety, depression, stress, pain, suffering, and misery is what entertainment sells every night and day. People keep buying and entertainment keeps selling. Now look at the next screen. Hung over from dope and alcohol. Good friends not alone. Heavy forest cover with plenty of shade trees. Sun during daylight, and so dark at night you can’t see your hand in front of your face. A brave man discovers a bat cave.

Please accept my apology if this is not true. Photographs with much less than 1000 words. Thanks for each number of undivided attention because this is no fatal attraction, so let’s count my money this time.

Gene Kestlarn!
