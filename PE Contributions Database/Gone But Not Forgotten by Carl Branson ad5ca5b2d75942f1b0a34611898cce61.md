**“Gone But Not Forgotten” by Carl Branson**

Dad would have turned 92 this past August (2017) while Mom would be 89 this coming March. Coincidentally, Mom and Dad both died at age 81. Incurable liver cancer took Dad, while Mom passed away a few years later due to a massive, immediately fatal stroke. Both were laid to rest while I was in the prison, making it paradoxically easier and harder to cope with the loss. The conflicting factors in that conundrum are far too complex to describe in the context of this missive.

In retrospect, I would have to characterize my parents as being in the “nearly perfect” category. How they achieved the delicate balance between being strict disciplinarians and caring, supportive motivators, I’ll never know. The “strict streak” no doubt stemmed from their childhood survival of the Great Depression as the first generation born in the U.S. to Polish, German, and Russian immigrants. Arguably, the caring, motivated side of their characteristics came from the “family first, last, and always” principles of the Slavic culture of their parents.

About the only real time in which my parents could be classified as “pushy” was in their quest for knowledge and self-improvement for their children. Although academic excellence was emphasized, it was not the only source of acquiring the level of competence living a self-sufficient life. A set of other skills were stressed, including cooking, cleaning, auto / appliance repair, growing vegetables and flowers, carpentry, plumbing, and electrical wiring.

As my brothers and I matured, we became focused on career choices. By the end of middle school, I knew that electronic engineering (circuit design) was in my future; as for my brothers, they were into medicine and becoming physicians. Again, the open-minded attitude that my parents had provided us insights and suggestions on how to “get the jump on the competition” in our chosen fields. Even when I was still in high school, I was working part-time as a TV/radio repair technician, whereas my brothers were orderlies in local hospitals. My parents’ unwavering support for our pursuing of these interests was ever present. Under my parents’ influence, my brothers and I modified that old adage to: “Jack of all trades and master of one.”

Sounds like the idyllic 50’s era “Leave It to Beaver,” “The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,” or “My Three Sons” sitcom household doesn’t it? In many ways, it was even better because when disagreements arose, heated shoutfests commonly ensued - especially during those turbulent teen years dealing with the Ant War and free love turmoil of the 60’s. I recall those emotionally charged contests as far more gratifying and energizing than the stoic, philosophical discussion portrayed in the sitcoms for conflict resolution.

Even while in prison, the doctrine of self-improvement instilled by my parents persists. Granted, the scope of opportunities to develop new or improve old skills is so severely limited. Nevertheless, Dad and Mom’s motivational principles continue to ring true.

Although now long gone, Mom and Dad will never be forgotten.
