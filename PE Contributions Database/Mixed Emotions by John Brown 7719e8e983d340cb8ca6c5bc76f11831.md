**Mixed Emotions by John Brown**

I've been noticing your confused expression, and was wondering what’s running through your mind? It seems to me that you are becoming confined to other people’s expectations for your life. You are beautiful, intelligent, and strong, so a lot of people will look for support and guidance when faced with struggles they can’t get through by themselves. You can not let yourself become like the people who want to see you fall. You must become like the person you were meant to be.

I am only a tool put on Earth by the divine to be utilized for righteousness. My music is my choice of weapon to battle all that is evil in this world. I escape the harshness thrown at me and shield those I love with unconditional love. I am who you say I am, but will never be anyone other than myself.

Hey! Are you listening to me?  Hell I guess not.

I am just caught up in a mix of emotions and the only person I can think of to turn to is me. This flower never responds.
