Everywhere you go. You are in view of what men create. Even if you were born blind. You still have of it. And, if you were born of deaf ears. Your touch was still in tact. But if I am wrong. If you had not, all three. Then, I pray you might feel it within your heart. Or, define it, within your mind. As definition itself. Is the idea of all conception.

Beauty is determined, by the cultural understandings, established throughout time. Just as most males adore the food their own mothers raised them on. Even though, as one grows, the taste buds within, change. But, not leaving out the fact, that by that time, other culinary delights have been experienced.

Regardless of this. We have all wore masks that once worked to block our sensory preceptors. Even if it was just to momentarily hide behind seeming indifference. And, even though, that particular truth has come to be seen as something proving we’re human. It most certainly creates within itself, an adverse effect. For, it cations our ability to trust. We know this, because we tell ourselves regularly, that nobody does something for nothing.

More than likely, you will shush yourself when entering a new, and unfamiliar environment. Or, wear sunglasses. Perhaps even perceiving them as a way to block out your own light. These beliefs formulating within as a type of defense mechanism. Because, you need time enough to seek out the obvious similarities in clear sight. Even though, when you find some. They could very well be someone else’s masks. Only, it is one you yourself created for them. As I myself have done. Whenever I created a personality without senses.
