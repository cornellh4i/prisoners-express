**Young Men On Couch by Vinicio Garcia**

“Those were the days my friend we thought they’d never end, we thought they’d last forever and a day.”

Grew up poor, didn’t own a car till I was 20. Didn’t drink or smoke in high school.

Went to college in 72 in Austin. Met Henry who owned a 65 white Mustang - Henry looked like Chong. R, a classmate from high school, and I became a threesome with Henry.

Henry and I were both long haired, R not so much.

I am now bombarded with hedonistic delights. Girls, alcohol and drugs. I lived in a dorm on the 2nd floor. The school cafeteria had food much better than I ever had at home. It was Paradise.

With extra money from school, I bought a stereo. R got some purple Micro Dot. Henry, R and I went up to my room and took the hits. I got high instantly. It took Henry and R a few minutes. Suddenly, we started laughing and couldn’t stop - After a few minutes, Henry asked why are we laughing? We stopped, best laughing high I ever had. No paranoia was experienced that night - we went to a local club, don’t remember any particulars.

Back in 72, Austin was the most beautiful city I had ever seen. Fields of Bluebonnets would spring up all over the city. Giant oak trees everywhere. I also remember how few fences people had - everybody was friendly, you felt like you were in the country, not a city of 235,000.

One day, we’re driving on S. Congress, we’re at a stoplight in front of St. Edwards. We had just gotten some good weed - we had two joints and a six pack. I light one up - take a couple of hits, very high quality - I turn to pass it to Henry who was driving - and low and behold, two cops in a squad car at the light next to us are looking at me. I put the joint down and I know they saw me - I told Henry who had extended his arm, “Put your arm down and don’t turn around.” Of course, the first thing Henry does is turn around. He says, “Oh shit” - not very loud, but he keeps his composure. I felt like I was in a Cheech and Chong mouse. The cops then make a no-no motion with their index fingers and drive off. Back then, it was just luck of the draw. Some cops would hassle you, some would not. We got lucky.

We went to the first Z-Z top concert in 73. It was at the UT football stadium, open seats. It began about 11:00 or so, when the gates opened - since we were at the front, even the slow movement of the people at the back generated enough force that the pressure was tremendous. Fortunately, it was a very well behaved crowd and they stopped and everything proceeded smoothly.

My girlfriend was chosen as designated driver - she didn’t drink or smoke. Only incident was a group next to us formed a human pyramid - we told them to stop and that they were too wasted. Didn’t listen - girl from the 4th level fell. Taken on a stretcher by an ambulance.

First group was great - we were high. Don’t remember who they were. Next groups were ok. Finally, Santana came on - he was 2nd Billing - unexpected surprise - Jimmy Paige gets on stage - it looked genuine and Santana was surprised - they jammed - electric - incredible guitars.

As the sun started to go down, you could see the stadium enveloped in weed smoke. BIrds started to circle above. Suddenly, a few at a time would begin flailing and start falling straight down then at about 30 or 40 feet, they would start flying again and circle above. They did this for quite a while - very entertaining.

Z-Z top came on. After 20 minutes, we left after having heard Santana and Jimmy Paige, it was very anti-climatic.

Girlfriend couldn’t drive, so I drove. Henry, R, and I would go mushroom hunting. We always respected people’s property. Never left trash or disturbed property.

One day in the fall, mushrooms were sparse. We went further than usual - got dark, we ate some small ones - Henry says someone’s watching - we suggest he’s high - I pick up a stick in case - when we get to the car, a pack of wild-looking dogs run up to the fence. Never saw or heard them - they were good hunters.

On Friday nights, we would drive to Marble Falls - the only place you could set Coors 40 miles away.

I got a job at Stop-N-Go - got held up twice in 3.5 months - Riverside and I-35. I decided to quit - they offered me another location. I rented a mobile home 100 yards from the shore or Lake Traucs - only neighbors were the shack, a cafe or a pier by the lake.

23 miles from Austin, people would come and trip on moonlit nights after a heavy rain - all types of fossils could be found on the shores - no one else for over a mile.

I was truly in Eden - I tried to buy the lot and mobile home. I was stunned at how much they wanted, but the realtor told me about James L. Stewart and the 37.8 acres of the Angermeier Estate. Henry and I became partners because we were the ones contributing the least money. I decided to invest after having an unusual experience at the property (see Appendix A). Got a contract to look at - first 6 names are Vice Presidents of the Bank of Austin - I’m thinking I’m in. It will take a couple of years to make improvements - I joined the AirForce to make the payments and I had to leave Eden. After all, all good things must come to an end. We got swindled - bankers got some of their money back, but we got zero. Stewart got ten years probation. What’s even more depressing is that the property tripled in value in less than three years. We would’ve made a lot of money. When I look back at those times, they were incredible times. The only thing I would change is the alcohol

Appendix A:

I didn’t know much about real estate or contracts, but I knew Austin. I had been in a hiking class where we walked 15 miles on Saturday and again on Sundays all over Austin. After Mr. Stewart took me to the estate, I decided I needed a sign.

On a Friday night, I took two joints, two six-packs and a weak hit of acid. There were two large boulders near the entrance. On one of them, you could climb up and sit on a flat recess. After about 1 AM, less than 20 feet away, 7 deer walked by me; it was a Big Buck - three females and three bambis. At the same time, they all stopped and turned around to look at me. I was smoking a joint in partial moonlight. Just as casually, they turned around and ambled off. To me, it was a sign.
