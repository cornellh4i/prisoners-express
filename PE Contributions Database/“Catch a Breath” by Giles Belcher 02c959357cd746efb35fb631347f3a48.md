**“Catch a Breath” by Giles Belcher**

I’m winded, just let me catch my breath, okay! I know you want to jump rope some more, so do I! This is fun, but can we just slow it down some! What is the jump count anyways? I lost count way back there! What about the others jumping rope? Did they quit or get tired? How many more rounds to go? Are we going to do the 2-3 jumps, rhyme chant, or cadence run? I’m lost on this one! Just be patient and let me catch my breath and thoughts. We go when I’m ready! It’s a little warm out here right now! Let me cool down, and we'll go again, gotta set a breather!
