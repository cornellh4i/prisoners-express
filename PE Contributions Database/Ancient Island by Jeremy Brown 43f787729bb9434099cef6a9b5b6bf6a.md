**"Ancient Island" by Jeremy Brown**

There was an ancient land floating in the middle of the sea. Trees as tall and high as can be. Ancient old ruins from a time yonder past. All nations rise and fall very fast. Waterfalls abound among the ruins of rock. Time keeps going tick-tock. This might have been Lemuria or Atlantis. All is left is a crawling praying mantis. The shadows creep and crawl at night. Sometimes a sailor drifts by and keeps silent of what he’s seen. A bright shimmer, an apparition with a luminescent gleam. Beams and rays of sunshine flow through the treetops and never stop. When no one is near, mermaids abound onto the shore. Mystical creature of ancient lore for I invoke thee. Unicorns traversing the rainbows, sylphs, salamander, and water sprites come and play. The fairies and gnomes weave their earth magic. Elves build their houses in the trees. The ruins are recreated to form the temple. It’s not so complicated. It’s simple. All of the myths were true; all things are possible. Why did the sailor ever doubt? He knows the truth now. He knows what has been hidden. In mainstream society, this magic is forbidden. “Yet, as clear as day, truth persists and how has all of this gone amiss? Right here, right there. My eyes and mind are all sober. O what peaceful sentient beings these are. Who would dare to deem this an evil? I sense no negativity here. Well, it’s late. This would go down with some lager and beer!” As soon as the sailor said that, his boat was guided in. Dwarves, gnomes, elves, and mermaids gave him praise and welcomed him to the ancient island. They all had a party in the sand. The mists were raised and the ancient island was not to be seen again.
