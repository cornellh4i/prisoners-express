**A Story about Knots by Catherine LaFleur**

During my recovery from COVID I was isolated in Plague Dorm D. I slept a lot in the morning, in the afternoon, and all night long. I was a weak noodle. I tried to walk the tiers, do a bit of yoga stretching, sit on the locker or a bench, and I was still exhausted by everything. I just kept nodding off.

All this inactivity began to affect me negatively. My muscles and joints started to ache. Then they knotted up. I would roll around in my bed of pain, having hallucinatory dreams, only to wake all bent up. Finally I was having something resembling a Charlie Horse in weird places like my upper arms and my back. One morning I awoke and could not turn my neck. I was crimped up in the shape of a flamingo. My cell neighbor, a woman of Wagerian proportions, had to pull me out of bed. Brunhilda said she was going to help me. First, I had to stand in the hot shower for twenty minutes. Then I had to meet her in the dressing room.

Just standing in the shower, dressing myself and creeping down the stairs winded me. The pain was horrible. I noticed Brunhilda had brought my rolled up sweatshirt down. At least my head would be cushioned. I obeyed her instruction to lay face down on the bench. As I started to stretch out a spasm seized me. It was a Charlie Horse breaking diagonally across my back. I tried to get back up, but Brunhilda pushed me down ruthlessly. She is a lot bigger and stronger than me. This unlicensed person then dug her fingertips into the spasm. I squealed really loud and tried to get her off of me. That’s when my shoulders were held down by Loki, who has been standing by unbeknownst to me.

What must this look like on camera? Me lying face down on the bench with my shirt pushed up. Loki gripping me by the shoulders, and Brunhilda using her knuckles and elbows to knead the knots. No response from the officer’s station. Sure doesn’t look suspicious at all.

Only speakey wheezes came out of me. My mouth was buried in the sweatshirt which Loki has stuck under my face. Whatever Brunhilda was pressing paralyzed me. Nothing stopped her. She pummeled me from neck to hips. I couldn’t feel anything but hot anaganozing lighting strikes. By that time I was crying. And whimpering. The more I wept the harder she pushed.

Then suddenly every knot released at the same time. I became relaxed and boneless. Loki let me go and Brunhilda stopped. They helped me sit up. I was dazed. In a slightly slurred voice, I thanked them as I stood upright like a human being for the first time in weeks.
