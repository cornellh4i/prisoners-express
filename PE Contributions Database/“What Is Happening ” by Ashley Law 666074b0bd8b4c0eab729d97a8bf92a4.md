**“What Is Happening?” by Ashley Law**

It's getting dark outside and as I'm walking I see these two little people, completely covered, in some form of latex looking skin tight material, chunky boots and chains on their feet, yet it looks as if the chains disappear into the ground. I stop walking, confused as they start shifting their bodies in a slow snake like dance, as if they can’t move their feet, luring me into their world.

Next thing I know, there I am, slowly in a trance walking toward them - as I get closer, I smell the most sweet smelling scent, it’s overwhelming and confusing - these little people are like reptiles. I notice what I thought was some form of material is actually skin, they have no facial features, yet it's like I can hear them telling me to set them free.

All of a sudden, I’m hit by something and I look around. I realize, duh! It’s Halloween! I start looking around for the two little people and I can’t find them, but I can smell them. I look down and see the chunky boots on the ground, chains disappearing into the ground and what’s left of the chains is covered in a very oily black liquid. I reach down to touch it and the black liquid quickly climbs up my arm, quickly engulfing my entire body. I feel the chains on my ankles. I look and see my feet inside the chunky boots and realize I am trapped. I feel my face, yet I no longer have facial features and I feel myself slowly moving my body in a trance like enticing movement. Who am I? What have I become? I continue asking myself as I look for someone I can lure in to touch me and release me from this weird element I’ve found myself in..
