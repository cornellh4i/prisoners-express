**“Emerging From the Fog”- A Foggy Prison by James Schmidt**

For a good many years this castle, this prison, has stood. Storms have battered the walls, thunder has rumbled the grounds. The fog would roll in like a wild horse, then the next time the fog would roll in like a slow snail. The guard towers can barely be seen one second, and then in the next moment the fog swallows it up.

So many days have gone by from the first day prisoners would be dropped off by train car, then the fog would linger around the tracks and out of the fog, the front of the steam locomotive would be seen or guards escorting prisoners into the prison walls.

More years would go by, new walls would go up. New cell halls made of brick went up, older prison cells were replaced. Fog would consume the prison, then as the sun lit through the fog you could see the year 1906 at the top of the building. Walking through the compound the chapel is masked in the fog, but walking past it the fog clears and there before your eyes is the oldest section of wall. Stopping and touching it, you wonder how many Civil War soldiers, slaves, and sad inmates have come before this wall. Soon, the thick fog rolls in and covers the wall.

Days warm and cold have passed. Looking towards the guard tower the fog releases the section of wall that holds the two huge metal doors. For a few seconds you think about your freedom. Your thoughts are soon interrupted as the fog covers the doors.

Here you can sit in your cell, the fog shall creep along and for a few seconds you may see the blue sky, you may see the other cell hall. You are surely to see the rusting steel bars on the windows and hear the prisoners shout or even scream. Much sadness lingers in the cell halls like a thick fog that won’t go away.

1846 is when this land here in this town became a prison. Inmates would come and go like fog, but too few would emerge feeling any kind of love. Many would kill themselves and their souls escaped the walls, floating through the fog on their way to heaven.

Many before me would call this A-range the North cell block. Surely they’d have to shout out their inmate numbers, but for me they call me by my last name. But yet I sit here in this castle and wonder how many times an inmate would give up his life to be free with the fog or to be a free man to walk through the fog to be with their loved ones.

The state prison that I’m in shall be here for a very long time and for the next seven years of my life it’ll be home here behind castle walls. Inmates will come and go just as the fog does, but not freely.
