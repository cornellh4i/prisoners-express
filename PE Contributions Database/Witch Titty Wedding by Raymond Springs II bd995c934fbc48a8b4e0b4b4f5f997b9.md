**Witch Titty Wedding     by Raymond Springs II**

Reluctantly I wish this piece whose memories and emotions of painful loss meet at life’s busiest intersection.

The year was 1997. I was 19 years old living in California’s finest city of San Diego, for those of you who never heard its slogan. My main thang had graduated that previous June and joined the United States Air Force. Her name was La Shana, she was 5 ft 4, light skinned, thick as a Georgia peach, and her smile created light in a dark room. To me she was number one; I loved her both passionately and logically. With her alone I could create a future. We talked about marriage for two and a half years and I made promises to her that if she joined the service and still wanted to be mine, I would come wherever she was and tie the knot…

A promise I’d keep!

After bootcamp she was sent to Shepards A+B in Witchalaw Falls, Texas to earn her skill training. Her field of interest was medical OBGYN, which was very exciting to me being that she’d been delivering babies into the world. After several long distance phone conversations, she asked me to join her there. I agreed so, and in less than a month I received a key in the mail with an address to our new apartment. In less than A week, I was there inside our one bedroom apartment. I was alone because she had to stay on base while in skill training.

In less than a month we were at the courthouse applying for a marriage license with two of the friends she’d met in basic training as witnesses.

My first American Wedding…

No matter what occurred later, LaShana Brodus Springs, I still love you because once upon a time you were my dream come true!

My second Witch Titty Wedding was to Angelina, a.k.a a lil Bit. We met in 2004 on the Greyhound bus the weekend before Mother’s Day. See, I was fresh out of prison and already on the run due to events that were completely out of my control, evolving family members and some gangbangers actions. My aunt was taking me to Harrisburg PA via the bus stop. My hair was long. I am 6’3’’ and as chocolate as can be. I am very smooth in conversation and a true ladies man. At 26, I was truly hypnotical. Well, I noticed a young boy with his hair done in a spree-well and asked him who had braided his hair. His reply was, “my mom. She is sitting right there.” Looking in the direction he was pointing I saw her with her daughter seated on the back seat, which is right next to the bathroom. I walked up to her and stated more than asked: “You should do my hair”. She asked why she should do a stranger's hair. I said,  “Because god will bless you for doing this for me.” She responded “I will think about it, ask me again at around 6 PM”.  I did, she gave me an appointed time the following morning, which I kept. We talked about everything and God. When she was done I kissed her hands. She began to cry, so I asked her why. She told me her dad told her the man she would marry would kiss her on the hands. Romance took over quickly and we sat side by side kissing, talking and just enjoying each other’s energy. Before she got off, she gave me her number and told me to call her when she returned to California in two weeks.

I moved back to California to be with her. After several months of passionate involvement we went to Witchalaw Kansas, where we were married in a church.

Angelina Warren Springs, I will forever love you no matter what happened to us because you showed me how beautiful spiritual love is.
