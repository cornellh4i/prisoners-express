**“Hooded Woman” by Leo Caldez**

Adam, in all his misery, was finally gone. Permanently.

It’s as if she could finally breathe. She didn’t give a rat’s ass what his family was whispering about; look at what she’s wearing, she isn’t even upset, who acts that way at their own husband’s funeral. They were right though, she wasn’t sad. In fact, she was relieved. See, they only thought they knew Adam, but that’s only because they were never married to him. Never saw how the drinking would turn him into a monster she didn’t even recognize. And the worst part, the absolute worst, was that he never remembered what he had done, where the bruises came from. And then all the broken promises to change, to quit. And for 10 years she had endured him, for the kids, but when she found her youngest daughter half naked crying in the shower...well, things had to change.

It wasn’t easy. Murder never is. She knew she would be the first suspect--the wife always is. But, the dark web is a treasure trove of illicit information. The intricacies of long-term, untraceable poisoning took over a year to plan and another four months to execute. In that time, she only questioned herself once, but when the test came back positive she knew she had no other choice...if not for her then for her unborn. And now it’s done. And she is free; her family safe.

So let them look, let them whisper. She’ll sleep at ease and at peace for maybe the first time in over ten years. And so will Adam.
