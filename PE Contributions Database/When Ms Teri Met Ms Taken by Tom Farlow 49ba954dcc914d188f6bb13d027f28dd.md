**“When Ms. Teri Met Ms. Taken” by Tom Farlow**

You know me, but you don’t know me. You stand there, sneer, and turn your head in disgust, all while claiming some vast moral superiority, looking down from your high horse while thinking I don’t deserve what I have.

Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful, but hate me because I cannot be ugly. In your mind, you assume beauty is some marvelous bestowment graced upon me without a trace of recompense. You could not stand further away from the truth. For starters, jealousy such as yours is but a small entry on the long list of penalties I must confront because of my face.

Overshadowing even your envy is the arrogant disregard your boyfriend has for my feelings, and even thinking I could possibly want him. He isn’t even my type. He and his ilk treat this world as a meat locker. I continually work my way through dodging their lusty and catcall bullets; sometimes successfully and sometimes not.

A room full of pain sits upon the second story of an unassuming brownstone somewhere in American suburbia, the home of an aging middle class couple. Littering the walls are scores of tarnishing trophies, framed and matted certificates, and first place medallions all hanging as a testament to my pain.

Pain that I have endured earning wins as beauty pageants, cheerleading contests and gymnastics meets where my endowments could be recognized.

Pain that I have endured, because even multiple first places weren’t good enough for Mom, who said I could always do better and would see that I did next time.

Can you possibly know what it is like to win and still be told you didn’t do well enough? You would have been lucky enough to find yourself handed a participation ribbon, yet your parents would have remained all agog, heaping praise over how awesome you had done.

Not me.

I have since left that shrine of pain and moved forward. No longer do I seek to please people with my looks or bat an eyelash to woo an inebriated judge. I am, instead, in the real world doing it the old fashion way: hard work.

Yet, there is your boyfriend, serving himself up as a reminder of the past I long to outdistance. So, slap him and wake him from his pigheaded fantasy.

Just don’t hate him because I’m irresistible. Hate yourself because you aren’t.
