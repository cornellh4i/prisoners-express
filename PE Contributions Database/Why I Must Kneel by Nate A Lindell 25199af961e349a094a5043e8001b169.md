**“Why I Must Kneel” by Nate A. Lindell**

Given my experiences in the WI prison system, I was thankful to be housed in some of the federal prisons instead (i.e. Allenwood, U.S.P., Coleman 1+2 USPS.) The food was decent in those places and the staff generally weren’t dedicated to making us miserable (an exception being Terre Haute U.S.P, where the food was trash, as were the majority of the white staff.)

There’s little to be thankful for in this life (the WI Secure Program Facility,) other than the fact that the staff are less gung-ho about using excessive force and tearing our cells apart in search of petty contraband (i.e. over 50 sheets of typing paper or a ketchup packet saved from a meal) than they once were. It’s hard to be thankful when you’re trapped in a system that is dedicated to stripping away as much quality from your life as it can possibly get away with.

At those federal pens, especially Coleman 2, most of the prisoners (including myself) had more pleasant attitudes, which enabled me to tolerate those with cranky ‘tudes. Most prisoners here, on the other hand, have caustic attitudes, no doubt due to the ambiguous diffuse attack on their humanness--their ability to be. They’re looking for enemies: “the man behind the curtain” who is responsible for this Oz. Unfortunately they can’t seem to see that man and end up lashing out at their neighbors.

For Thanksgiving, we will not receive turkey meat. Instead we will receive a slab of “turkey loaf”, which has the consistency of used condoms. Years ago, feeling generous, they served us a ball of processed turkey “products”, which included both “stuffing” and cranberry-esque paste. Our Christmas meal will be similarly sardonic.

From our cells, we can’t see the outdoors. Twice a week, if the permits and the staff can’t think of another excuse, we can spend 75 minutes in a kennel and see the sky, smell the air, and admire the uniformity of the lethal electric fence that surrounds us. Sometimes there’s a sane-ish guy out there whom I can converse with, if the others out there aren’t shouting too loud.

It’s hard to be thankful when the people we might have and who might care about us can only visit us through the TV monitor that’s about 18 inches and sits eight feet away from us on the other side of armored glass. We must speak with them over an intercom system that usually only relays two out of every three words, but often doesn’t work at all. Most visitors stop coming…

Should we be thankful that the neo-lib Judge Barbara Crabb appointed her comrade Ed Garvey (prior Dem candidate for governor) to represent us on a class action suit challenging these conditions? Should we appreciate that his firm was paid nearly a million dollars to force a settlement on us despite over 90% of us objecting?

Can we be thankful that they no longer keep mentally ill prisoners here, in solitary/restrictive housing? Well I knew a handful of strong men who decided that severely lacerating themselves was less painful than spending more years here. I’ve seen others declared sane and kept here, despite spending months in suicide observation status or living in piss, shit soaked cells, unable to communicate with anyone. I’ve seen these men try to kill themselves in various ways at any opportunity, some of whom are currently diagnosed as schizophrenic and bipolar.

Staff sometimes ask me, “How are you doing?” They genuinely sound sincere. It amazes me how oblivious they are to their role in crimes against humanity.

I don’t want to not be thankful, yet it is impossible for me to be given the society that I live in that tolerates this. (I am thankful for PE staff, volunteers and people like you). I understand that not being thankful makes my company less desirable, but I am unable to fake it. I am unable to “stand for the anthem.”
