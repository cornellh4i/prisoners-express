**“Unpaid” by Jeremy Brown**

For many years we have slaved, fought, and worked hard for our African nation. Trying to make it a better place. We get no respect from even our own. They fear us. Our government fears us. We enlisted because there was nowhere else for us to work. Now we regret that action. We have been unpaid for three years now. We started our own Unson No Work strike until we get paid. Our families are starving. There are no more farms for us to till the land. We need this payment. We are but lowly soldiers, basic conscripts at beast. There are a few leaders here.

It’s been six months since our strike. We have gone underground - literally. Right now we are in an underground bunker we built out of concrete. Three thousand of us are here. Currently we are finished with our African government. We are in Egypt, far from our capital. Planning, working, seeking, building up our cache of Russian fifties-era weapons. Soon we will rise against our tyrannical oppressors. We will strike fast and hard and assassinate those who would deprive us of our dignity as humans. Maybe we won’t have to take such violent, drastic measures.

We could kidnap and get a ransom. Yay! Yes yes! This will be our solution. All three thousand of us and our families will go underground. We will build our own sovereign community. And why not. We will purchase solar panels, generators, hydroponic systems. All is possible.
