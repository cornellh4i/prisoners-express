***Blind* by Delvin Diles**

****It probably would have been a better idea to try to hoop with the fellas. I had no game when I wasn’t high, and so smoking a blunt with E, Dee, and Lil’ Sammy made my off-shot, bad handles, and experimental D funnier than usual. That kind of humor was better than the emasculation I was catching, being the only fool on the sidelines. P, the only dude conscientious enough to be a non-smoker in the clique was merciless, pausing before passing the ball inbounds just to glare and growl at me, “What you lookin’ at?!” I could laugh right along with the “Dope-fiend” taunts from those stoner-athletes, but my vision blurred when my boy P checked me. I thought we were cooler than that; I thought, “That’s alright. I’ll just go home.”

I walked in the general direction of my house, which would have been easier if I knew that neighborhood, wasn’t in a sad blunt haze, and didn’t choose a dark street. It was pitch-black for real: I had to walk slowly alongside the curb to find my way, and at times, a lighter would spark from a porch, or a house light would glow and voices came from the shadows. After what seemed forever, I saw familiar lights past an intersection. Oh, hell naw--it was the basketball park. I circled the block, and knowing I would be called a “dumbass-dope-fiend,” I asked someone for a ride home since I was too high to walk alone. Then, in mid-cacophonous-multiple-clown session, I realized I could see the street I was supposed to take the first time. At least that last walk of shame was without mortal fear and was the right way home.
