**Almost By LeRoy Sodorff**

****How close is almost? Is it inches away from a goal and not crossing that line? Is it rounding second and you’re ready to go all the way but you don’t make it to third base? Is it when you go the distance and make a pass, then someone drops the ball and you fail to score? Or is it when you’re out there running in the human race, jumping over all the obstacles that life puts in your path, then in the final stretch you pull up short and your only excuse is “I’m lame?”

But life isn’t always about winning when you cross that line or hitting it big when you make that score. One day, I was on the easy street cruising down the road to life, fell asleep at the wheel, lost control and crossed that line. On that night, I “almost” died!

A moment is over in a flash but a memory lasts forever.
