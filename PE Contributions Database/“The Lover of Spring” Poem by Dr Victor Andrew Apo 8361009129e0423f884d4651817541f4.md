**“The Lover of Spring” Poem by Dr. Victor Andrew Apodace Sr.**

Now you notice the Buzz of the bumblebee. As the flower awakens the shoots modified for the reproduction. The bearing of leaves are specialized.

As the honeydew has caused the wetness, the Rosy-dewy folds spring to life as the hot sun courses through its’ rainy prickly brier of the bushey wildrose….

It sees the bumblebee large and swollen as it parts the dewy folds to allow the Bumblebee to enter into heaven’s gates where all life begins…

The deeper thought is to wonder why the flower and the Bumblebee need to become one, as the heavy aroma floods the air of the open mountain Garden as all the flowers try to bring the bumblebee and bed, but the Rose knows that the Bumblebee will thrust its propagating fluid to begin life anew…

The catyt in its cuplike cavity for the flowering bud, the Corolla of its petals unfolds, the carpel is ready as the Bumblebee has the slamen, as they have the only relationship in which they are so different…

The insect and the flower but the one without the other life would cease to exist…

The pircuture is not so much the erotic content, but the attitude with which confronts the them of CARNAL LOVE….
