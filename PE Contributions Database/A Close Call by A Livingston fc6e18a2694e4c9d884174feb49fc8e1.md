**A Close Call by A. Livingston**

At the age of 22, given five years probation on a burglary charge which could have landed me in the prison system, that “I got by” should have scared me on a straight path. But it was not to be.

Only to find myself charged with murder in the first degree a few years later, sentenced with a death sentence on Florida’s death row, thoughts in Limbo for four full years not knowing how or when that dreaded word would come from the governor “it’s that time” to meet old sparky.

Along came a new trial and I was delivered from meeting an end with old sparky and given multiple life sentences in return. It was a relief for that moment, especially for my parents as well as myself. As the days turn into years and the years into decades and I see the same faces grow old, hairs turning grey, bodies starting to break down from the wear and tear I start to wonder.

I heard it once said that “this is all an illusion” in which our lives in this world consist of, and that the real life begins in the life after. Well, hearing this I yearn to see the reality of this truth at times and even help it come to pass, but from what I’ve been taught and even read in the sacred writings of the scriptures this is a taboo, so I’ll have to stick it out on this rough road I’ve been traveling on for 37 years and counting.
