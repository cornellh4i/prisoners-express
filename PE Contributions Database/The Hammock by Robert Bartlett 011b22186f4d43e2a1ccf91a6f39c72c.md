**The Hammock**

I like my women kinky,

But not so much my rope.

Cottonâ€™s good for clotheslines

But not so much for dope.

I spun some fiber into twine.

Then I wove a net.

I hung it up between two trees

And rolled a cigarette.

I sowed a field of cannabis

A green, delightful plot.

Linnaeus and Sativa,

Past the old woodlot.

I planted grass for fiber

And pot for THC.

Take off your coat and stay awhile.

Fulfill my fantasy.

Get up off the divan.

It holds the desert temp.

Lie down here beside me

And drift on knots of hemp.
