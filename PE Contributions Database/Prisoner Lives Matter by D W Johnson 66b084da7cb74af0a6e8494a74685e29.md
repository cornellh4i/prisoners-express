**Prisoner Lives Matter by D. W. Johnson**

I’m full of unpopular opinions.

Do prisoner lives matter? Probably not.

Not factoring in all the “what-ifs” and “potential” (yeah we may all get released and become doctors and social workers and stuff-doubtful.) As of now you are a net loss to society. A drain on resources. A burden to your family.

What are you giving back?

You may argue “life for life’s sake” that all lives are precious. I agree! But then that means your life has no more value than that of an ant.

I prefer to ask, especially of myself, what are you going to do to make your life matter?
