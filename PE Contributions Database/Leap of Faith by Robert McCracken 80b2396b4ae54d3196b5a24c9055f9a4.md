****We, as a people, need to take a leap of faith and do away with faith altogether. Freedom and freedom of religion cannot effectively co-exist. Vatican City is the wealthiest city in the world. The Catholic Church, at both its core and crust, is an imperialist institution. At ties, it took the road less travelled, utilizing swords instead of senate. Yet their choice of roads taken ultimately led them to the kingdom of heaven on earth. And now, literally all roads lead to Rome, the Holy Monopoly which seeks not to possess the businesses, corporations, and commodities of the people, but the very people themselves.

In my opinion, capitalism by conquest is respectable compared to your standard capitalism by way of manipulation, and I would have no problem with the former were it not invariably tainted by the latter. There is a certain beauty in the honesty and humanity of peoples such as the Mongols and Gauls that you donâ€™t find often today. To conquer one is to exploit one, and to exploit a victory is to capitalize on it. So whether they call it freeing an enslaved or oppressed people, bringing culture and progress to the barbaric, or simply spreading the word of God, capitalism by conquest is the oldest form of both capitalism and conquest.

A perfect example of the oppression and exploitation of a people, born from the foolishness of their faiths, can be found in Ireland. The Irish people rightly recognize their government as the source of their woes, but what they fail to realize is that without unity, they can never hope to bring about any significant change. While their so-called troubles revolve mainly around their half a dozen or so political parties and their paramilitary wings, the real foundation of their disunity is their religious schism. If the people of Ireland ever hope to be free, then they must do away with their religion before they attempt to significantly change their government. The same goes for all nations. For even if the people could, however unlikely, come together in their religious, political, and ideological differences long enough to overthrow their oppressive government, they would still remain slaves to their faiths. Thus, although you may knock down the entire structure of imperialism, the original foundation of disunity will remain and invariable by build upon once again.
