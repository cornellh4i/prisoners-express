**“Why This Time of the Year” by Brian Lowe**

Why is it always toward the end of the year when the word “thankful” (and similar cognates) are thrown around the most? From the limited knowledge I have come up with three main reasons for this and since all three are related they will overlap in parts. Perhaps elaboration upon this subject can provide enlightenment. These three reasons, presented in order of antiquity are: 1) end of the year cycle; 2) religious belief systems framed around that; and 3) our modern perceptions of the holy days (holidays) as symbols of the previous two. These are not the most exclusive reasons to be thankful; however, since the true reason for being thankful is everything.

Let’s go way back into prehistory to discuss the end of the year cycle. Primitive man saw winter as the death of the year and as the precursor to its renewal. He gave thanks for the year and rested until the cycle started over during the spring. Winter, in and of itself, was not to be thankful for; cold, disease, and starvation were all too common, but knowing that all things needed to rest before they could start anew was. The inventiveness of showing this thankful attitude leads to our new reason: religion.

Man, being a spiritual creature in aw of the world, originally had no understanding of how natural processes worked. Thus, the creation of supernatural entities and the belief systems surrounding them came into being in order to deal with the unknown. They incorporated their understanding of the natural world with their cultural norms so they could “appease” forces that they could not control. So when something went their way in a positive fashion they were thankful. So with this sense of being thankful having been ingrained deep in the psyche of primitive man it is reinforced through the structure of religious systems.

These two set the scene for our modern perception of these religious systems: holidays. The end of the year cycle or stated earlier, the season is full of holidays that celebrate being thankful and all can be traced to the previous reasons.

That is why an attempt to know the truth of why I am being thankful and not just do so because everyone else is or that's how it’s always been done. I choose to be consciously thankful for everything. Each day builds upon another so each moment is the culmination of what has come before. Basically put, look at it like this --everyday is Thanksgiving, Christmas, and your birthday in one. Live like it.
