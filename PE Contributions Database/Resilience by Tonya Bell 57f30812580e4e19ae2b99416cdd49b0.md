**Resilience by Tonya Bell**

Is the ability to recover from or adjust easily to change or misfortune.

Whatever we do in life regardless of adjusting or not we are responsible for the outcome. Everyone is responsible, we have to have patience and self-restraint, which would allow us to recover from our past ways. Hold fast.
