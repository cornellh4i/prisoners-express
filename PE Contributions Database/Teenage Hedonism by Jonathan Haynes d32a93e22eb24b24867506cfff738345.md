"Teenage Hedonism" by Jonathan Haynes

The teenage years are characterized by young adults throwing caution to the wind as they experiment with bizarre lifestyles in an effort to forge their own identities. The Amish go through “Rumspringa” during adolescence, when they are allowed to partake in the ways of the world outside of their communities. Many try smoking and drinking during these years. How many more engage in premarital sex, use illegal drugs, and listen to amplified heavy metal music? Only the Amish know.

The philosophy behind Rumspringa is profound. The Pennsylvania Dutch believe that their way of life must be freely chosen after the young folk have a taste of the alternatives. This is the true essence of liberty, surely. To knowingly choose among the many paths life offers.

The Dutch (or actually “Deutsch”, because they are ethnically and linguistically German) offer a viable alternative to the individualistic hedonism that prevails among the “English”, as they call us.

It is true that they live a cloistered life, where education stops at the 8th grade and “The Good Book” is often the only book in the house.

It is also true that their anti-modernist stance has been somewhat bent by compromise (or, less kindly, hypocrisy) as regards the modern world. They won’t drive cars, but they have no problem with riding in an air-conditioned van.

Sure, one can snipe and quibble about little things, but when, in the last days, Helter Skelter starts coming down fast, the Amish will be uniquely and favorably situated to survive the collapse of the Tower of Babel built up by arrogance and idolatry.

Someday you and I may find ourselves on our knees before a Bishop, begging for admittance to the “Old Order.”
