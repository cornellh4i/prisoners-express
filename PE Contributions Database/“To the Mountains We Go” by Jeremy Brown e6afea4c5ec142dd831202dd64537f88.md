“Traveling around this world I have seen mountains, rivers, valleys, luscious landscapes, just to take it all in, bewilders the mind.” - Amelia Earhart

**“To the Mountains We Go” by Jeremy Brown**

To the mountains we go

Traveling through the ice flow

Feeling the cold wind blow

We are the ones who change

Nature is in this world

O come, o come, ye people

Of this treacherous world

To the mountains we go

Trekking through the rivers

We do fluidly flow

Not too fast nor too slow

We go we do gooo

To the mountains we go

Breathing in, breathing out

This inner divine chi

This supreme mountain

Energy

We are the healers

Of mother earth

Now we do see

Our mountain dome

Energy

Can you feel this moment?

Can you see

Nature is not dead

Nature is intelligentsia

To the mountains we go

Our truth is found

In the ice flow

Can you sense this feeling

Of something infinitely more

This grandeur

To the mountains we gooo…

Author’s note: This is in dedication to the mountains of coffee creek California of which were a big part of my vision quest where I was younger in my teens. Just lovely!
