***Learning to Drive* by Will VanSant**

Lost? Me? Hello, no! I know exactly where I am…

I’m here.

At the moment, there is a 7-by-9-foot cell in the special housing unit at the FCI in Seagoville, Texas. Seagoville has been here for about six months--the SHU for the last five weeks--and will continue to be here for two more years.

So, no I’m not lost. I’m here. But after I’m released in 2018 and I’m not here anymore? Well, that would be there.

Only thing is, there is just one big question mark. When I get out, I have no home or job to return to, no one waiting to take me in. I have no contact with the remnants of my abusive and toxic birth family. My two children are both grown, Tori with her career as a graphic designer and own home with her boyfriend, and Reid ensconced in his college life at film school. Of all the people who once populated my life, only my ex-wife and a scant four friends want anything to do with a felon, especially a sex offender.

After prison, I’ll be beyond homeless. I’ll be completely rootless, untethered, adrift. And if I have no clue where there is how the hell do I find my way? So, yeah, I guess I am lost, after all. Go figure.

Thinking about it, if I go by the qualifier of “No clue where there is,” I realize I’ve been lost, to one extent or another, most of my life. I’d just been going along with no real destination or plan. Everything that ever really worked out successfully for me, be it relationships, jobs, whatever, pretty much fell into my lap without any real goal setting, foundation laying or proper up keeping on my part. That’s probably why precious few of those things, notably that tiny handful of remaining friendships, ever stood the test of time.

In essence, I’ve spent a half-century as not much more than a passive observer in the journey of my life. I’ve really just been an often oblivious passenger in the car, watching the scenery go by, not even being so much as a backseat driver.

And the irony here is that I’m one of those rare males who never hesitates to pull over and ask directions when I need to. But if you just go through life living in the moment to a fault, only in the here and now, with no clear idea of where you’re heading, how can you possibly even know that you’re not lost? And if you don’t know you’re lost, you’re not likely to pull over and ask directions. And, to take the analogy one step further, if you’re not even the one driving…

Yeah, I’m pretty damned lost. Like that night years ago after my niece Jeny’s wedding. There we were, packed in the Plymouth Voyager-- my 78 year old mother, 9 year old Tori, 7 year old Reid, and a very stressed out me behind the wheel -- lost late at night on the outskirts of New Jersey's Pine Barriers. No grid-work blocks like this city boy is used to, no traffic lights or street signs, no bars on my cell phone, no gas stations. Just dark, winding, free lined roads, and mounting frustration anger at yourself, and fear, all of which I had to fight to hide. And oh yeah, three passengers openly expressing all those emotions. Obviously, we found our way out of the woods that night. (It helped that I eventually spotted a gas station and made a bee line for it!)

But where do I pull over to ask directions on this kind of road trip? Generally spacing, the staff here isn’t breaking a sweat to help with issues down the road and beyond these fences. My two best buddies, Jesse and Travis, are the only people here I truly trust, but as brothers, not necessarily life coaches. Who does that leave? My kids? My ex? Those few friends who still write? And how can I even ask any of them for directions if I still don’t know where the hell I’m going physically and metaphorically? I can’t wait for my goal to find me, as I did with my former marriage and my former career as a journalist. That travel plan--or lack of a plan--only ever led me to some pretty regrettable destinations: divorce, unemployment, addiction., mental illness isolation and ultimately, prison. Failure is once again preordained if I don’t first decide where I’m heading, and then set my course and prepare for the journey.

Which is why, while I sit here, it’s up to me to choose where there is. And then I have to finally do what I’ve never really done before: Take the wheel and drive the car.
