**"Jokes" by Ellis Hyatt**

“How did the wedding go?” asked  the preacher’s wife.

“Just fine until I asked the bride if she would obey, and she said ‘Do you think I’m nuts?’, and the groom said ‘I do’...Then things really began to happen fast.”

A firefighter was working on the engine outside the station when he noticed a little girl next door in a little red wagon with little ladders hanging off the side and a garden hose tightly coiled in the middle. The girl was wearing a firefighter’s helmet and had the wagon tied to a dog and a cat. The firefighter walked over to take a closer look.

“That sure is a nice firetruck,” the firefighter said with admiration.

“Thanks,” the little girl said.

The firefighter looked a little closer and noticed the girl had tied the wagon to the dog’s collar and to the cat’s tail.

“Little partner,” the firefighter said, “I don’t want to tell you how to run your firetruck, but if you were to tie that around the cat’s collar, I think you could go faster”.

The little girl calmly replied, “You’re probably right, but then I wouldn’t have a siren”.

Three older gals are at the doctor for a cognitive reasoning test. The doctor says to the first woman, “What is three times three?”

“297” was her prompt reply.

“Umm hum” says the doctor. He then says to the second lady, “It’s your turn, now, what is three times three?”

She answers, “Friday”.

“Ummm humm...” The doctor then says to the third gal, “Ok ma’am your turn. What is three times three?”

“Nine” she says.

“That’s wonderful!” Says the doc, “tell me how did you get that?”

She replies, “It’s simple--I just subtracted 297 from Friday!”.

One day, a father was reading his paper. His young son came in and asked “Dad, will you take me to the zoo tomorrow?” “No”, said his father. “If they want you, they can come and get you”.

The village blacksmith finally found an apprentice willing to work hard at low pay for long hours. The smithy immediately began his instructions to the lad, “When I take the shoe out of the fire, I’ll lay it on the anvil, and when I nod my head, you hit it with this hammer.”

The apprentice did just as he was told, and now he’s the village blacksmith.

A woman decided to have her portrait painted. She told the artist, “Paint me with diamond rings, a diamond necklace, emerald bracelets, a ruby broach, and a gold rolex.”

“But you aren’t wearing any of those things,” he replied.

“I know,” she answered. “It’s in case I should die before my husband. You see, I’m sure he will remarry right away, and I want his new wife to go crazy looking for the jewelry!”

A grandfather bought a hobby horse by mail order as a birthday present for his granddaughter. The toy arrived in 189 pieces. The instructions said that it could be put together in an hour. However, it took the old man two days to assemble the toy. Finally when it was all put together, he wrote a check, cut it into 189 pieces, and mailed it off to the company.
