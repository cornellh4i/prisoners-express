**Making Love by Bernard Wroblewski**

Making love in the nighttime, with the moon bright up above with your every touch. My heart soars like a dove. Riding the high of taking in your every last detail. It’s like a marvelous journey through an exotic fairy tale. To look upon you and to get lost in your eyes. Your flawless beauty eclipses even the brightest tequila sunrise.

But making love, it’s more than just the urge of sexual embrace, it's about being in tune with your lover in the most sacred place. To be able to communicate without the need to speak the smile that speeds your pulse and makes your knees weak. Reading body language like reading lines on a map. The subtlest touch that makes your heart boom and clap.

Making love that never judges with malice or mocking laughter but is abundant with calm understanding from here on after. Something that envelopes you with a passion completely unchained the flawless canvas that remains unmarried and unstained. It’s a connection that every dreamer hopes to find, a perfectly painted bliss that is truly one of a kind.

When truly making love, it’s divine food for the soul, partaking of the vital half that makes you a whole. Having the proverbial “rib” returned to its cage. An honest spiritual bond that is all of the mythical rage. A love that is forever but feels like it passes so fast to wake up to your one and know you’re in heaven at last.

I wrote this poem to say that love and making love is something unique and special. To be so in love with someone. When a man loves a woman so much, he’ll share her pregnancy pains, her weird hunger. As a couple. A true couple. You’ll finish each other's sentences. Almost read each other's minds. Think on the same wavelengths.

Everytime you touch or lock eyes. Electricity flows through you and the room. You’ll sacrifice everything for each other. Nothing could possibly tear you apart or sew discord.

And when your world is in chaos, when it feels like life has turned your world upside down, and you’re suffocating. And it's unbearable. Then when that person walks in the room, when you wake up beside them and hold them in your arms, you know that everything is going to be okay. Because as long as you have your love, you can make it through anything. You can walk through the very fires of Hell without batting an eye. Because you have them beside you. And vice versa.

That is the kind of love I want to find.
