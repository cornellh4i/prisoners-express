**When Life Gives You Pain Make Poetry**

By Chad Frank

This has been my motto for years. Whenever I’m having a hard time, I pick up a pen and dig deep into my wounds, laying myself bare on the blank page. It’s a cathartic experience that always produces beautiful art. I’ve been getting more and more poems published and responses from readers, which shows that my work registers with others.

I’ve found that when life gives me pain, it’s best to make poetry and I suggest you all give it a try.
