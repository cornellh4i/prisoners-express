**Spring Fever by Amon-Ra**

The centripetal force of the planet in today’s time has caused changes in the seasons, some places are getting hotter than normal or when the season don’t regularly experience such climate and when spring gets hotter than normal we get spring fever.

Early men/human didn’t have the full and meaningful opportunity to influence the weather as modern men/humans to project prophecy and fulfill those prophecies by influencing the weather, climate and alternate the experiences of seasons across the globe only in local regions at a time which was based on extreme annual calculations and measurements. Today modern men/humans have the experiences, records and wisdom and failures of the ancient men/human involving the study of weather and the seasons to benefit the well-being of the agricultural economic system of civilization. There exist a rapid mode of seasonal studies now because the economy in the United States have more people to provide for which is based on capitalistic monetary return for the land use crop return and tax return. And if controllers of any system of economy over large amount of people exist like this one there will be strategic analysis and studies of how to influence the seasons, climate, water resources and regulation and if the people begin to challenge the system of economy of the politics thereof on the partisan politicians that seed to regulate the water resources and land use tax that’s for religious agriculture seasons will begin to exhibit changes-changes that causes fury in the soil, plants, veggies, fruits and people and that bring about spring fever…

The people should pay more attention to the weather, seasons and agriculture infrastructure and produces this spring because the governments are becoming today’s prophets through their media and environmental protection agencies. They’ve notified us in some much propaganda that we living in the midst of spring fever-fever-fever-fever-fever. It's off the hook you all… It’s spring fever make sure you don’t use too much water on your grass now.
