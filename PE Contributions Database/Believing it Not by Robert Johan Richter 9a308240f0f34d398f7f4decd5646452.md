Believing it Not Robert Johan Richter

News Flash: Your delusional belief system has no effect on reality. The Universe has its own system of rules, and it doesn’t care about you. You should be learning those rules, but you are not. People enforce social rules on other people, then act as if they can regulate reality in this manner. Dead men are worshipped, Einstein and Hawking are lauded for their knowledge and wisdom. People who have abandoned their belief in God make gods of men.

One day, some famous physicist will discover that there is no such thing as a magnetic field, that the entire system of physics, from Maxwell to Higgs bosons, from black holes to dark matter and dark energy, is specious nonsense. People will believe him, not because he is correct, but because of who he is. His credentials (ironically in the very field he negates!) will give him credibility. What comes next?

Suddenly, all kinds of people will come out of the woodwork. “Wait! I read all of this on PE, PF, APWA websites years ago!” I published the biggest scientific discoveries of all time, but nobody paid attention because I am nobody. The facts don’t matter, people only follow other people. The rare few truly intelligent people are marginalised, despised, ignored. Believe it or not, I’m the sane one here. Society, all of it, is insane.
