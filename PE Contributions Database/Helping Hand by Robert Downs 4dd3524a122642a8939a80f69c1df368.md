**Helping Hand by Robert Downs**

I didn’t know I was in need of a helping hand until it was offered to me. Now that I’m holding a hand (a white-knuckled grip) I don’t know how I made it this far without it. It’s like those days and nights of my past (spent wondering and stumbling) were nothing but sadistic nightmares. It’s as if I was truly born anew when I took his hand into mine-my sins washed away mistakes forgiven, failures shrugged off.

I was at the end of the road, the bottom of the barrel, the edge of the cliff. I would contemplate suicide daily (sometimes hourly). I couldn’t find a sufficient reason to keep waking up, to keep crawling out of bed. I had no goals, hopes, dreams, or aspirations. I had hit rock bottom. That there was a better way, a straight path, a helping hand just waiting for me had never crossed my mind. I see now that I had to hit the bottom before I could climb upward, before I could stand up, my head held high.

I began writing In earnest about a year and a half ago. It begun with journal entries, and from there It expanded to poetry, essays, and a bit of fiction. I had all of these pent up feelings and thoughts that I had to get out of my head. It was (and sometimes is) a frantic rush-full of words and sentences, commas and periods-one which when started couldn't stop until I had run out of “gas” so to speak. At the end of each “session” I would be left drained of energy and emotion; it’s like I was really pouring myself onto the pages of my journal.

Through my writing I was able to confess my failures, mistakes, shortcomings, and my wasted chances; I was able to get them Into the open air, onto something physical. Once that was done I was able to beign the slow procces of slowly discovering myself anew of mending the damage that years of drugs, sex and laziness caused to my fractured psyche, my distorted fractured psyche, my distorted self-image. I believe that by awakening the dormant writer within me I was able to steer myself towards my purpose, my reason for continued existence: helping others with my vowels and consonants, and helping myself by walking along the straight path, the path of Allah. Now all I had to do was fully devote myself to these things these lifelines that were thrown to me as I was drowning. I had to practice what I wrote and make sure my feet found purchase along the straight path.

It's been five days since I’ve fully committed myself to my writing and living my dream and, for the first time in years, I feel great!! I can look towards my future and not be overcome with fear, depression, and self pity. I've set goals for myself, learned how to hope and dream once again, and I have aspirations that drive me everyday to live better, to become better than I was the day before. I must surround myself with positive reinforcements, true encouragements, and those with similar thoughts and feelings. I can't afford to lose this bit of progress I've made by allowing the wrong people to remain In my life, or to enter my life. To regress back into that hopeless empty cask would surely mean the death of me. I refuse to die, to backslide into that blackhole that is my past.

Gods helping hand has changed the way I perceive my surrounding myself, and my future. I've fully submitted myself to Allah, to living how he wants me to, and to whatever happens to me. I've given up control my life, and I couldn't be more sure of my decision. I'm not afraid anymore of the unknown, of the days and nights to come.

It was the best decision I have ever made.
