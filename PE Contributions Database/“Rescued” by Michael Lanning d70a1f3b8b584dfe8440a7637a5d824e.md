**“Rescued” by Michael Lanning**

Rescued? Once a long time ago. It was in the late ‘60s. I was almost 15. The hippies were for peace and love, not the Vietnam War. Freedom, Drugs, Groovy. So I opened up to a friend about being gay. The next thing I know, Father Phondle of the Church of God Loves You hates me. I’m suddenly an outcast, and I’m going to burn in hell because God hates fags. The church told my parents. No damn homo is going to live in my house. The kid is sick; he isn’t mine.

So there I was, ditching school, and hitching a ride to Huntington Beach. Walking the shoreline blonde, blue-eyed, young taut body boy wanting love. Suddenly everyone was asking me if I needed help. I quickly had enough money for bus fare, food, and more.

One day, a really nice-looking guy in his 30s asked if I would like to join him for lunch. I told him sure and followed him to his car which turned out to be an incredible red, turbo Porsche, Carrera. We drove through Malibu until we arrived at a mansion overlooking the pacific. Come to find out he was a Hollywood film producer.

Everything was awesome, and I was living a dream. No longer just existing or surviving, I was loved. I was cared for. I had value. I had joy I smiled. I giggled. I had a life actually happily living as myself.

Then the killing kindness of the state intervened to rescue me from this horrible monster, and committed me, against my will, for psychiatric review, to study any long term damage done to me. While my true rescuer was carted away to prison for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.

The state, operating with the best intentions and a smug assurance of their own superiority and wisdom, could never understand the many nights when I first knew what I was. I laid in bed, praying to a God to make me normal or kill me.

Finally broken, I was brainwashed that I was abused and used as a toy. No, I wasn’t abused or hurt. I wasn’t evil, sick, or wrong. I didn’t know anymore. They patted themselves on the back for concluding I had a mental illness. However, I was cured with electroshock therapy, and numerous heavy doses of chemical-lobotomy drugs. Then they sent me back into an actual abusive hateful existence in another “loving Christian” foster home. I had been rescued by the wonderful Department of Child Social Services.
