**Making Ends Meet by Yankee Lawyer**

Life was good (in prison terms) at Warren C.I., my last medium custody location. When I made my greens, I was immediately shipped to Greene, C.I. That was in February. After many enquiries, applications and a grievance, I still have not been offered a job.

I’m hungry. I’m bored. I’m angry. I’m disgusted.

Still, I smile and greet people warmly wherever I go. People ask me how I do it. I have learned both to abound and to be obased.

Pamela didn’t pay her rent, so I struggled to make ends meet. After we were married and had our first child, we moved to North Carolina, I had gold and silver, stocks and bonds, and money in the bank. We should have been alright until I got admitted to the bar in North Carolina. I learned the hard way about provincialism and racism in the dirty, dirty South.

I worked three jobs. I hardly had time to be with my children, but made a lot of money. Some went for diapers and pull-ups for three children, some for food, but most for drugs.

Pamela damaged my son’s brain, so we got monthly S.S.I checks. I sold off my real estate. We should have had enough money to live well, but Pamela’s appetite for drugs was insatiable. I pressured her to get help. She had me arrested.

With me in jail, Pamela and her boyfriend were able to use my children for more than just welfare allotments. They made movies. They expanded Pamela’s prostitution business witha stable of beautiful and talented young people of both sexes.

In jail, I sold eggs for cigarettes and cigarettes for cash. I made a lot of money at the poker table. My wants were simple, my needs were few, so I always managed to make ends meet.

In prison, I worked in the kitchen. I was a chaplain’s clerk. I made good money in a sewing plant for a while. I did alright. Even here in GCI. I do a little legal work now and then. I’m hungry but not starving.

God will provide.
