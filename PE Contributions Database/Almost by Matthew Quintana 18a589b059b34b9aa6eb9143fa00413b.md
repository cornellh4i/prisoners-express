**Almost By Matthew Quintana**

It’s Friday, my chest day in the weight room. I’m looking forward to lifting the whole stack on the 1970’s universal bench press, 310 pounds. It’s composed of ten and fifteen pound weight plates that sit behind the bench. Placing a pin in whatever weight slot one desires changes the weight.

The machine is old, crooked from guys misusing it. It’s scarred with weld marks and rust. When it’s being used, it squeaks like the branch of a dead tree in the wind. Unlike most modern bench presses, it starts in the bottom position, with the bar close to the chest. The first nine plates are ten pounds each, the rest are fifteen pounds, up to 310 pounds of iron in the whole stack.

I’ve benched 295 for one repetition. I’ve lifted 280 pounds for two reps but have failed time after time when trying for the big 310.

I enter the weight room and as always, I’m the first person in. Then comes Leonard, Wonk, James and everyone else. Leonard’s crew goes to the far corner to the lat pull-down machine, like they do every Friday.

“Are you going to hit the whole stack today, Matt?” My workout partner of a year and a half, Jon, asks, knowing I attempt every Friday to lift it all.

“Yeah,” I reply. “I gotta hit a few warm ups first.”

The weight room by now is full of the noises of men grunting, weights clapping and between sets the conversations of fitness and newly learned routines.

Jon is about 5’6, 180 pounds, forty-five years old and in good shape. He works out for fitness and health. Myself on the other hand, and I’m twenty-five years old, 5’7, 168 pounds solid. I workout for strength and looks and I admire bodybuilders such as Frank Zane, Dorian Yates, and Phil Heath.

I do my first warm up set of eight reps and 195 pounds with Jon spotting me the whole time.

“Gotta getta pump,” is being shouted all over; it’s our weight room motto.

“Gotta getta pump!” I say loudly after my light warm up set.

Jon starts his warm up with a hefty 235 pounds. He tends to start heavy and work lighter as he goes, the opposite of myself.

I rest a moment before returning to the bench. I put on 250 pounds for my second warm up. I lie under the weight, which starts in the bottom position, bar touching my chest, arms bent, not extended and away from the chest like most bench presses.

I push the weight up and do six reps. I feel strong today! I think I can hit the 310 pounds! I rise off the bench.

“Good set,” says Wonk, just coming back from the water fountain down the hall.

I know before attempting to lift so much weight, I have to wait at least three or four minutes to let my muscles rest or else my pecs and triceps will be too exhausted and I will have no chance at lifting that amount of iron.

In the meantime, Jon does two sets: the first at 235 pounds and the second at 220. After my long rest period, I am ready to attempt to lift the whole weight stack. I put the pin all the way down to the bottom, at the 310 mark. I lie on my back on the bench and get into position. I am going to lift in a way similar to the way a power lifter does, with my elbows in, heels pressing into the ground, back arched, a thumb-less grip, and being sure not to lift my butt from the bench. This form is different from the way a bodybuilder might lift with elbows out and back completely flat. I will bench like a powerlifter to increase the load I can lift by using my whole body, not just my chest and arms.

I have Jon and Leonard help me get into an up position. I’ll start with my arms extended. They help me into positions and now I’m on my own. I feel the pressure of the weight as I let it down slowly but not too slow. As the bar touches my chest I grunt loudly, all the rage, anger, anxiety and sorrow I have is being released on this bar. I feel the tightness in my chest, arms turning to Jell-O, the flesh-frying pain of 310 pounds, the weight of the world.

I’m pushing up hard now; it’s slowly moving, my heels grinding into the floor. I hear the squeaking of the machine and feel the blood rushing through my limbs. I’m halfway up now; the weight stops moving. It is too much strain! The bar falls on my chest. I sigh. Luckily it wasn’t free weights or I would have been crushed. I had it! I know that I had it...almost.
