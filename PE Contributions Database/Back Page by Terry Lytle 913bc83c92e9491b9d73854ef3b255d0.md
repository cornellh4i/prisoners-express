**“Back Page” by Terry Lytle**

As I… transform into action, I am centered. Wherever the prison express takes me - be it cell change or transfer - I am free… the prison, its own prisoner. I have taken the initiative, to remain diverse… my creative expression, more about the rehabilitation… of self. Through the information received, I continue to educate my senses, my intellect… so that I may understand opportunities available… if nothing else, to comprehend them.

I’ve never been to Ithaca… yet; although I watched a movie about Attica… more than once. I must’ve been no more than seven, as it was when my family was living in Georgia in ‘82… one of the sleepless nights suffered even back then… alone…

Watching cable TV by myself, in a living room big enough to hold two of these prison cells - maybe three - you would have never convinced me would become my home for more than half my life…

Indeed - such is the individual, who has lived his life for the summer… where I’ve seen many more things than “ReHABILITATION” swept under the rug… the oxymoron covering just as many lovingly hateful things as well.

I have a nephew named Daniel; the prison I’m at,… its superintendant, its “Warden”, - his name is Daniel Daniels… I write this in jest - that line - practicing to become more wisecrackingly witty… for, I want to smile with you - laugh out loud at the witticism… sprung, from wit.

.... that I use in isolation to exercise my mind.

(Which is what I’ve done here, “look-reading” the Summer 17,, back page.

Thank you for the opportunity.)

Note: The Warden’s name line is true!
