**My Parents By Thomas Hightower**

Why do people in America, or the world, think that a typical family unit is mother, father, child(ren)? There is no such thing as a “normal” family.

I began this dirge of misery with the 12/1/17 picture prompt. As I wrote them, my parents were not the “Leave it to Beaver” made for “G” rated TV families. I do not know a single person from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, or 2000s who had a picture-perfect childhood. I’ve worked and lived among every socioeconomic group from birth--from the abject poverty of poor, unskilled laborers, to the South Lake Tahoe crowds of the rich and famous before my fall in ‘95 to my current 30 to life sentence.

I found that there exists no ideal family. Ultra-rich spoiled teens are more screwed up in the head than the ghetto, raised-among-gangs child of poverty. The rich teen, with access to all the best and healthcare, including birth control or abortion, shall go out screwing their way through life with no care of consequences. Rich girls who do drugs, screw the poor bad boys, and throw away their birth control just to get pregnant. The hope is that their rich, busy, self-centered, workaholic parents will be shocked by the pregnancy enough to actually begin to act like parents at last. The threat of a scandal as a result of the out-of-wedlock pregnancy seldom makes a difference. Instead, the poor bad boy father who wants to be a better dad than his own absent father is threatened with jail--or paid off to get lost. The rich teen mother is now put out of the mansion and given an allowance to stay gone. She, in turn, now treats her child with the same lack of love and lack of nurture she learned as a child of the rich.

The child of the rich teen becomes just as cold and thoughtless as their mother. Only they seek trouble, drugs, and adrenaline-pumping extremes, because life has no meaning. No love. The child feels worthless, unloved.

The rich child and the ghetto child share similarities--absent parents. For the poor child, it’s drugs, prison, or the death of the parents which causes the dysfunctional parenting to continue generation after generation. The rich child is just as likely to lose the presence of proper upbringing, only it’s due to total, callous, self-interest of the rich parent, which leads to absenteeism. Rich or poor, there is some outside influence that splits the family unit to pieces.

We look outside the borders of Western society, we see just as many children raised alone or by foster parents of some kind. It’s usually disease, poverty, war or death of some type that takes their parents. So they too shall continue this funeral dirge of dysfunctional generation after generation.

Nothing in this world matters when it comes to parents being responsible to teach right and wrong to their offspring. The religious and non-religious are also equally as abusive and absent. So why does the world of TV and politics try to claim there are normal, unified family units to aspire to be? It’s all a fallacy. Even our very first parents Adam and Eve were dysfunctional. After all, they were made homeless and cast out of Paradise when Eve listened to the serpent and lied to God. The lives of the first two children Abel and Cain ended abruptly when Cain murdered his brother Abel in a fit of jealous rage. I guess Adam and Eve were not ideal parents either. If you are an evolutionist--well parents then killed the defective disabled child or abandoned them to the elements because life was too harsh to care. Either the young child pulled their own weight at a young age or got thrown out of the tribe. Survival of the fittest, remember?

So my readers, why do we still lie to ourselves and think all parents should be good parents unless they are defective? In the real world, all parents, children, and human beings are flawed, defective. We can only strive to attempt to teach better skills to future generations. But so far, there has never been a typical, perfect parent, except on TV of the 1950s. That generation was lying to you too!

It’s sad, but true! “May God help us all!”
