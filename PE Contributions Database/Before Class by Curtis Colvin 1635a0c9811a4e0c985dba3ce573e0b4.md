**"Before Class" by Curtis Colvin**

Look at us, stoned again right before class. I almost failed 11th grade because of it. Paul (the tallest one) always had either weed or alcohol. Me (the one in the middle) would have some kind of pills, stolen from my mom’s collection. Brian (the blonde one) sometimes has some LSD or mushroom tea.

We would meet in the woods across from our school about 30 minutes before class starts. Downing the alcohol while chasing the pills/acid and smoking a joint at the same time was our repertoire. We usually only had 20 minutes until the first bell rang, so the quicker we imbibed, the better. Also we had to have a cigarette before class.

The picture you see got us in trouble. Sam took it then showed it around. Just so happened, during American History, Mrs. Cruel got ahold of it while Peggy was looking at it. The picture was taken right before class that morning with Sam’s Polaroid. You can see the brick and walls of the school behind us. So most of all, we’re busted big time because there is no smoking on campus. But Paul got caught trying to get the picture back out of Mrs. Bruel’s desk. Double trouble! For I was supposed to be the lookout, and she just walked up on me while the cheerleader squad walked by. I couldn’t take my eyes off of them!

So, three days suspension with our parents having to pick us up. Man of man, did I get punished. A week later, a cool hall monitor came and handed me the picture. He said it was sitting out on a desk, so he grabbed it. Partying proof positive pupils.
