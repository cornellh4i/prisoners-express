**Making Love by Richard Atkins Jr.**

The first hour, as your body lay next to me, where I want to be, it’s all about pleasing you.

Removing your jeans, your heels, but leaving on your shirt and panties. Kissing those soft lips through your lace panties as I massage your inner thighs and moan your name. By the time I remove your panties down your beautiful skin called legs, you’ll be wet for me to enter, but no, not yet.

My fingers part your red sea to let my hot tongue probe and invade your secret box only I have permission to investigate.

I repeat this game until you cum harder than a nascar on a residential street. Then I roll you over, pull you up onto all fours and seek to destroy your vaginal walls so that you put much respect on my name.

If this dark skin, brown eyed, 6 foot 1, 214lb, athletic build man doesn’t do anything else you will explain to your sister, your aunt, and your girlfriend how I made your body call out to me, shiver and grant me the access to always beagle to make love to you before this is how this east side Stockton, California King enjoys making love.
