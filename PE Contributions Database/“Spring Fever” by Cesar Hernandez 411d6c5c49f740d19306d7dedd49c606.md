**“Spring Fever” by Cesar Hernandez**

My friend ends up pregnant at the MTV spring break party in Mexico. Back in the day, MTV used to throw huge spring break parties. Every year it was in a different location. There are always concerts, celebrities, and lots of people at the party.

One year, MTV is going to be in Mexico. My friend says she really wants to go. I tell her that’s not a good idea. My friend likes to drink tequila. Once she starts, she doesn’t stop until she almost blacks out.

My friend goes down to Mexico. She says she hopes she comes up on the TV footage, even if it’s only for one second.

She’s at a bar and starts drinking tequila. She meets a guy. She doesn’t even know his name. They go back to her hotel room. When she wakes up, he’s gone.

My friend comes back home. A couple of weeks later she feels sick. She doesn’t ever get sick. She finally goes to the doctor. The doctor runs some tests and congratulates her on being pregnant. She tells the doctor she does not know the name of the father or where he lives.

She’s very ashamed at getting pregnant in Mexico. She only tells a couple of people she got pregnant in Mexico. Her parents are definitely not on board. They basically disown her.

When her baby bump starts showing, she tells people she got pregnant at work. She says the father is one of the three married men that work in her department. That usually shuts down further inquiries. She is too embarrassed to admit her son was conceived by some unknown man at the MTV spring break party in Mexico.

When she goes into labor, her parents still don’t help her out. She almost gives birth in a cab. She gets to the hospital and they prep her to go to a delivery room. They didn’t make it to the delivery room. The baby pops out when they are wheeling her to the delivery room.

Her parents take about two years to warm up to their grandson. They are very religious. They were very embarrassed that their daughter conceived a child with an unknown man.
