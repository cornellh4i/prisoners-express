"Margo’s Pictures Part 4" by Geneva Philips

Lenore was nervous. The pocket on the front of her bag held a small fortune in gold disks. Not coins, really, since they weren’t stamped as far as she could tell, but certainly coin-shaped and probably worth more than she’d ever earned in a year. And the necklace. The necklace rested heavily in her jacket pocket. She’d thought it tarnished when she found it out in the desert tied up in a dry-rotted bundle of leather. She’d tried to clean it only to find blackened metal, not tarnished at all, almost like black gold, impossible as that was, but still, whenever the sunlight played upon the surface she could see a dark yellow shine deep within the black metal itself. The stones were even stranger. The were black also, but the light moved through them like smoke through a shadowy room. All in all things were weird as hell and here she was in a park in Lemon, California looking for a girl in a picture.

The crow chuckled mockingly from a garbage receptacle. “Right back at you, buddy,” she mumbled at it half-heartedly. Her attention focused on her surroundings, looking for the young, dark-haired girl in her picture. The fourth picture in her stack. Perched on the rim of the container, the crow flapped its wings laboriously and noisily, endangering its precarious footing. Making sure it had caught her attention it turned its head purposefully in the opposite direction of where she had been about to start walking.

She turns without a word and heads off deeper into the pack just as the bird has indicated she should. The crow gives a call at her back sounding somehow encouraging.

It made for an eerie feeling, Lenore had to admit, when you walked up on the living subject of a picture you’d carried for months. The exact subject--a pretty dark-haired girl lying full length on a park bench--downcast eyes, smoldering cigarette and all.

It made for a much eerier feeling when said girl raised her eyes and they looked like swirling pools of smoke encased in clear orbs.

“Holy shit,” Lenore thinks.

The girl blinked and her eyes were suddenly an ordinary blue. She blinked again and they seemed brown. Blink. Green.

Lenore’s legs folded neatly up under her and she found herself sitting on a patch of not-too-dry grass relatively close to the girl she’d been hoping to find.

The girl looked at her with now hazel colored eyes. The cigarette she is smoking smells spicy and pungent. Not cloves but something else, darker and richer. Lenore imagines this is what peat smoke would smell like if you mixed it with opium and a little patchouli. The slight breeze shifts and the wafting scent blows into Lenore’s face. She feels instantly light-headed and disoriented.

The girl smiles, inhales deeply and her eyes fill with the strange billowing smoke before settling into a dark hard yellow brown. Tiger’s eye.

“You have my necklace.” She says, her voice carries a soft sibilance, which makes the sentence sound like either a statement or quite a question. Regardless, Lenore plucks the ornament from her pocket and hands it over. She has a surreal feeling, yes, but more like all of this is scripted or being played out and she can only stumble through her small part uncomprehending of the larger play going on around her.

The girl deftly lifts the jewelry from her outstretched hand making it disappear into her own clothing in one fluid motion.

She sits up, drawing deeply from the cigarette. “A favor for a favor, Ellenore, what do you ask.” The girl says again her strange accent again turning the sentence into something off. Not a question, not a statement. She blows out a plume of grey white smoke, undeterminable punctuation.

Lenore tries to shake the feeling that seems to have overtaken and overwhelmed her.

“Who are you and what am I supposed to be doing with these pictures?” She asks finally forcing the words out through the haze of her confusion.

The girl drops the butt of the cigarette and grinds it beneath her shoe relentlessly until all that remains it a shredded filter saturated with a thick green tar.

She flashes a quick feral looking smile and her eyes go completely black from corner to corner and in their inky depths pinpricks of light glitter for a moment, starts dying in a breath before she blinks and they are gone, replaced by a mundane skyblue. “Margothea called me--,” she mutters something sibilant and liquid sounding in a language older than time. Then switches back to her accented english, “but you can cell me Delphi, I always liked that name simple as it was.”

“As for what you’re doing? Finding your destiny of course, just as Margothea--Margo to you--found her destiny her so must you find your destiny elsewhere. I’m guessing she left the pictures to help you, and that feathered fool,” she says while waving a negligent hand at the nearby trees which held, of course, the crow. A shrill caw of indignation followed this insult.

The girl stood up, ready to leave. “BUT, WHAT NOW?” Lenore asks before she can make her exit.

“Here’s a clue,” the girl says, eyes once more rolling smoke, “You’re in Southern California and the last picture is on water. GO WEST.” She finishes with disdain and strides off.
