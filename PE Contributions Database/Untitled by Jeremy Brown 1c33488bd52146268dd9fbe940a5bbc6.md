It is not important to know my name. By the time you receive this, it will already be too late to act. I am recording this message, and once you receive it, you will find 2 of us dead. We both have escaped. A person under the water. That is why you see my wearing this mask. My blood needs to oxygenate due to the pressure and other factors.

We were in a militarized prison. My friend and I spent 20 years for a series of killings we did not commit. We were Black Ops, sworn to protect our country. America has failed us. My friend I carry is comatose due to a concussion coming up. The killings were committed by a self-sentient Artificial Intelligence Cybernetic Droid. We were the ones sent on the mission to be the goats, the fall guys. We were told that there were biological, chemical compounds in the area that we needed to search, find, deconstruct.

We were targeted for the fall. These fucking fat cats in D.C., International Bank frauders, and super, mega wealthy oil barons, creating nonsensical wars to fill their own coffers. This message is a warning to all of the American People. We need to be aware, act, and stop being so naive. The system is for the 1%. The people are a legal gang used for the security and protection of the state. We need to dismantle the state and dismantle police gangs. We need to reinstitute self-organized militias and guns and weapons for the protection of all small communities.

This negative system needs to be dismantled from the inside from every level. May all who hear this message rebel against all authorities on passive aggressive, non-violent levels. Grow your own foods. Build your own houses. Stop buying into consumerism. Live frugally. Stop spending. Be content. Let go. I have 2 days of scraps left. I have a chip in my body; someone will find me. May this message fall into the right hands.

Your friend in solidarity,
