“Yeah bro, and I stole that bike.”

“Man, you both suck…”

“Oh yeah? What’d you do, Mike?”

“I asked out Emily Withington”

“Damn, that took all your balls…”

“Yeah, I was half-drunk, dude.”

“Weren’t we all?”

“Man, I’m glad we’re bros.”

“Shut up Dave, we ain’t got no choice…”

“Like fuck we don’t, Billy.”

“Shut up Mike, I can’t stand your sass.”

“Can’t we three just get along?”

“Me too man, it’s splitting open.”

“Wow dudes, how many shots did we take?”

“Too many Billy, you were all over the place.”

“Oh yea? So were you, Maniac Mike…”

“Shut the hell up Dave.”
