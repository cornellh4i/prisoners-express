Facing fear is something the Bible encourages us to do, and while it tells us how to do it, we stubbornly refuse to heed, learn and practice its message. I will search for verses which address the issue of facing fear then pray that Jesus moves my heart to put it into practice.

Facing fear is something I have been aware of, but I have been putting it off until today. Whether fear of going crazy, fear of meeting with the Christian circle due to differences, fear of my capacity to contribute what I have learned from my Bible study, fear of leaving the cell without my bible, fear I might get into a confrontation with someone due to my rape-murder conviction which will cause further time in prison, fear of speaking up to my cellie about living conditions, fear of being rejected, fear of not having the same mind as other Christians which then makes me feel lonely due to my isolation, fear of rejection because I have been wavering back and forth with the group. I just don’t feel comfortable.

Facing fear then is now my priority because I see how fear is stopping me from interacting with others. I don’t mean to now go to the other extreme, but rather give my problem to Jesus in prayer and scriptures like Proverbs 29:25 and 1 John 4:18. And search for compatible people I get along with, which is difficult in prison because we all became criminals to the extremes.

So this is how I will be facing fear:

Proverbs 29:25 -- Memorize, meditate upon it, recite it when I awake. Trust in Jesus who overcame death and promised likewise for all who believe in Him (John 5:24). Since I am promised eternal life, I only need to embrace what is inevitable in order to achieve it--death… (Hebrews 2:14). Another way I will face my fear is to face the torments (1 John 4:18). I put myself through my self talk. It’s simple -- Isaiah 26:3: Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayeth on thee because he trusted in thee.

Wow! How peaceful I look forward to be. As I recall the things I had accumulated in life before prison, none of it helped me face my fears and difficulties I had no peace. How I look forward, ironically, to have peace with imprisonment and to face my fears in this hostile environment.

I look forward to facing my fears by intense commitment to Jesus and the Bible because I have experienced positive results since my 21 years of being locked up. Though I still get negative when I awake, I don’t have any positive alternative other than Jesus and the Bible. The world didn’t help me when it came time to face my lawlessness whether in or out of prison. However, Jesus has helped me and will help me, especially when I surrender to His perfect will and plan for my life. I am now ready to start facing my fears.
