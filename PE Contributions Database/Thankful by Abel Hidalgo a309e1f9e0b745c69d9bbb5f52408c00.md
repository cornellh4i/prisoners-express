**Thankful By Abel Hidalgo**

Thanksgiving is a day to be thankful for what’s important to you.

I am currently a death row inmate who is fighting the state of Arizona for custody of me. I am in the Federal Bureau of Prison’s custody due to a life sentence I am serving first, or so I believe with the grace of God this will happen.

While here waiting for the final decision on whether the Feds give me to deathrow, I have been experiencing hardship in a mental capacity. I was on the verge of letting go, at that point of no return, when a special person entered my life and unknowingly brought me back from disconnecting from humanity through her beauty and insight into life, and how she views it. Her knowledge and experience is vast, considering her age, and she surprised me to no end. Her current status of being a transgender at first put me off due to my upbringing and religion, but as time went by I realized that she is a beautiful woman with a lot to give. Before I knew it, I fell madly in love--a love so deeply rooted into my very soul I still can’t believe this is possible, but nevertheless I am extremely grateful for this gift of life, this all-consuming love that engulfs my very mind to the extreme. To this woman (Katie Hidalgo), my soon-to-be wife, thank you for all that you are, for the love and happiness you bring into my life. I also most importantly thank God for his love and for putting this beautiful woman in my path to heal me, and for letting me know that he will always give us a way out when things get rough. In the name of Jesus, thank you Father God.
