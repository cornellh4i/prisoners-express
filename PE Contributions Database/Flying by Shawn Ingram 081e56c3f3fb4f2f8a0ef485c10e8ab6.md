**“Flying” by Shawn Ingram**

Depression in prison is similar to being stuck in an oversized SUV, in the middle of rush hour traffic, on the hottest day of the summer, with a broken AC and only an ⅛ of a tank of gas left. Completely grounding of all hopes and dreams. Your brain hurts and your heart seems dead but you awake every morning just the same. Rarely anything of significance happens or changes. You are stuck to the ground that even getting up can be difficult.

Reading a novel though, WOW, that can set you clear for an immediate take off down runway 101. No matter if you enjoy fantasy, sci-fi, romance, or murder mysteries, you can soar as free as an eagle on the updrafts of beautiful blue sky over the mountains. Make your choice; do you want to ride on the back of a dragon, fly an alien space ship, maybe a long adventure on the back of the doggish luck-dragon or just a private jet to the tropics? Be free for hours on end. Send your mind beyond the chains, cuffs, fences, and gangs.

Just be careful to keep an eye out for turbulence of thoughts about family, loved ones, and others on the outside that you miss so much. Be healthy and mentally free for them and yourself. Keep to the clear blue skies over mountains or above the hot white sand of the beaches.

Love the time you have to read and explore stories you never would have read otherwise. Love yourself and keep flying high.
