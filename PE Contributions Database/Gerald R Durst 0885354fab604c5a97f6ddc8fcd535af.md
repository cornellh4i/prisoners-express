**by Gerald R. Durst**

This is one of my fondest memories. It was a little, bitty two-screen movie theater. When I say “little bitty,” I mean that it was dwarfed by the bank next door. The Walnut Twin Theatre in Garland, Texas sat just off Walnut Street in one of those strip mall areas. There was another business in front of it, but sadly I forget what it was.

Now the Twin itself had only two screens, thus it’s name, for second run movies. Those are movies that have been at the big multi-plex theaters that have 10 or more screens. The ticket booth was dead center of the front with only a single window, and room for one person. There were doors on both sides with the one on your right, as you face the ticket booth, as the only entrance. All other doors were exits.

You entered into a red carpeted room. On the right was a door for employees to go in to reach the time clock, and to go upstairs to the projection booths.

Directly across from the ticket booth was the concession stand. This is where I worked. In the center was our candy display case. King Sized Reese’s, Twizzlers, Dots, Snickers and more filled this case. On the right customer’s point-of-view, we had the cash register with a popcorn pit beside. The pit held several buckets of popcorn which we transferred to from the popcorn popper on the other side in the leg of the L the counter formed. Next on this side was the hot butter dispenser, and beside that was the soft-drink dispenser. I recall Sprite, Coke, Dr. Pepper and a root beer among the drinks we served.

Behind us was a table where we kept the hot dog rack. This was a glass box with a Ferris wheel for hot dog wieners in it. We could put two wieners side-by-side. I think it held 24 all told, and rotated so that they cooked evenly. On top was a bun warmer. We kept so many hot dog buns inside. I forget exactly how many buns it held. At least half the number of weenies as the rack. We had to keep water in this box, but if too much, the buns got soggy. Too little water, and the buns dried out. Here on this table we also had a Nacho chip warmer so we could serve up nachos. We had a cheese pump/warmer that we put gallon cans of Rico’s cheese into. This warmer had to have a little water in it for the cheese can to sit in. Then we inserted the pump into the cheese. We also had mustard+relish for the dogs, and jalapenos for both the Nachos+dogs.

On a Friday or Saturday night starting about 4 or 5 p.m. We started jumping. We would do a very brisk business right up until both films started. Thankfully all prices were rounded to the nearest quarter and had the sales tax already included. This kept thinking to a minimum during those fast paced intermissions. So glad.

I really enjoyed that job. Movies for me, family and my guests(yeah, okay, dates) were free, So was popcorn and sodas. All else was half price. That’s awesome for a hot dog connoisseur like me. That little theater, and 7-11 had the best hot dogs.

I met a lot of nice people, pretty girls (a couple became girlfriends), and fun co-workers there. Saw a lot of good movies. Took a lot of dates there. And I enjoyed the Saturday morning kids show. We had a couple of school buses bring in kindergarten-aged kids for a movie that was just right for their ages. Their ticket price included a small soda, small popcorn and some other little treat.

I miss that first job. It was a great place to spend the early 80’s. I wasn’t even driving yet. Mom had to drop me off, and pick me up. Oh, youth.
