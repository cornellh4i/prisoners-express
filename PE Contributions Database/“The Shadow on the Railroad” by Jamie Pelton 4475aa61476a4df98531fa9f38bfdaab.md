**“The Shadow on the Railroad” by Jamie Pelton**

The other day I was walking in the woods about a hundred yards from the railroad, and I could hear a strange, raspy female voice singing. The closer I came to the railroad, the louder and clearer I could hear this strange and unfamiliar song… “The shadow on the railroad. The cops a-looking for the shadow on the railroad. A murder is about to happen when the shadow on the railroad is near, look out, look out we see the shadow on the railroad is near.”

I panicked and ran, and as I put some distance between the railroad and I, the singing stopped. *What a freaky experience that was*, I thought as I entered town. I had no idea just how freaky things were about to get.

The next day I read in the newspaper that a man was found dead somewhere near where I heard the song. As I put the newspaper down, I heard the song loud and clear… “The shadow on the railroad saw you were near. The cops a-looking for the shadow on the railroad. You better hide, bud, things happen when the shadow on the railroad is near.”

I couldn’t take it anymore and I clasped my hands over my ears. I began to run out of my house. There in the street I saw a cloaked figure that seemed to be a solid shadowy figure. I closed my eyes, and I clearly saw the cloaked figure killing that man on the railroad. Behind the murder scene I saw a shadowy figure motioning toward me to come follow the shadow.

As I opened my eyes, I heard the song again… ”The shadow on the railroad is near. The cops a-looking for you. You better hide, the shadow on the railroad is near.”

I start to run as fast as I can and I don’t know why. But I start running for the woods near the railroad. This is not happening to me I think, as something from behind me starts to grab my shoulder. I feel an icy touch, and I smell a foul odor behind me. I glance back to see the cloaked figure is right behind me. I run as fast as I can and the closer I get to the woods, the clearer the song is to me. “...The shadow on the railroad is near. The cops a-trying to silence you. The shadow on the railroad welcomes you.”

*I definitely did not want to hear that*, I think. Then I hear a very clear order to run into the mist to fight off the cops.

I begin to shut my eyes, and I see another vision. I see the grove of trees I was walking in the other day and I see a mist that a shadow is pointing at. I begin to sprint as fast as I can towards the grove of trees that has been my safe spot since childhood. Since the time I saw little Jimmy fall off the shed on the hill near the railroad tracks. I was blamed for it, but I knew I saw a shadow. Now I see the cloaked figure pushed Jimmy that day.

I hear the song so clearly now. “...The shadow on the railroad is near the mist. Run into the mist to be one with the shadow on the railroad. When the shadow on the railroad is near, murder by cops is held at bay.”

I now run into the mist and I hear “Cops are cancer of people's shadows and you are now one with the shadow of the railroad.”

That was 2 days ago and now I’m in a town about 50 miles away. I am listening to the song of the shadow realm. It calls me to a little girl. I see her with her mother. “But Mommy, I didn’t push Mark off the bridge that is by the railroad tracks,” the little girl says.

I look around and I see at least 20 cops all waiting for me to leave. The girl’s mother leaves her. The girl whispers to the shadows, “Hurt Mark!” The cops glare at her. I sing my song.

“...The shadow on the railroad is near. Cops know who you are. Don’t run for I hold them at bay. The shadow on the railroad is near. Don’t run girl, for murderous cops are near, and this town needs you.”
