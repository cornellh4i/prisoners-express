**"Family Reunion" by Cesar Hernandez**

I hated family reunions. I was basically alone. I had no one close to my age. Out of all my cousins, I had cousins who were six to twelve years younger than me. At the other end, I had cousins who were all ten to seventeen years older than me.

Most of the family was in the northern part of the state so usually reunions were at one of our families. Every year and then the reunion would be in the southern part of the state. Their houses were all somewhat small so we would always have to get a hotel room.

Either way, I had no one to talk to. The women were usually in the kitchen talking. The men were usually talking and listening to the radio by the grill or in the living room watching a movie. The younger cousins were usually playing video games. I grew up without video games so I did not know how to play. The older cousins were usually talking about their own families or work.

I would usually wander around from group to group without really being part of any group.
