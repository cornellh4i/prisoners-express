***A Call to Faith* by Chad Dias**

A call to faith. Not meant to be disseminated amongst only one specific ethnic race.

A call to faith. Meant for the masses, to surrender to a monotheistic belief. Of which Jews, Christians and Muslims can agree, amounts to salvation.

A call to faith. Of philanthropic undertaking. Where the aim is unification, with an earnest aspiration to save a congregation, and ultimately the entire nation, with a call to faith.
