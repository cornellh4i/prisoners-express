**"Be Nice to Each Other" by Shannon Richardson**

My name is Xenia. That’s me in the picture--the girl with the braids. I’m holding onto my dad, hoping he will protect me. My mom and little brother are behind me. Today is my birthday. It was the worst birthday I’ve ever had.

My mommy made my favorite breakfast this morning. It was so yummy! Then she gave me a new doll. We didn’t have much money, so my mommy made my doll. She was so pretty. She had long black hair like mine. She had brown eyes like mine too. I didn’t even get to name her. I wish I had by doll now.

I was dancing around with my doll when I heard screaming and a lot of pops outside. My daddy ran in the house and grabbed me and told my mom to grab my brother. My doll fell on the floor. I cried for her but daddy wouldn’t stop.

We ran out of the back of our house and straight to the water. Daddy jumped in with me and mommy jumped in with my brother. The water was so cold, but I was too afraid to notice too much. There were popping noises and screams all around us.

The last popping noise I heard made my daddy cry. Then there was blood all over both of us. Daddy stopped moving. He leaned over and grabbed the grass.

I tried to see where the popping sounds were coming from, but I couldn’t see around the grass. Daddy fell under the water. I tried to pull him back up, but my mommy told me to keep walking. We left Daddy under the water.

My mommy, my brother, and I made it to my aunt’s house and ran inside. She lives in another village. I didn’t hear any more popping noises that day, but I hear them in my sleep. I want to go back to our house, but mommy says no.

I heard mommy talking to my aunt when they thought I was sleeping. She said bad men came to our village and killed almost everyone. Only a few of us got away. She said daddy died too, but I don’t believe it. He has to be back home and I have to find a way back to him. I miss him really badly.

Why would anyone want to kill us? What did we do? Mommy says my brother and I have to be nice to each other. If kids can be nice to each other, why can’t big people be nice to each other too? I don’t understand. Mommy says I will understand when I am bigger. If this is how big people act, I don’t want to get bigger. I want to stay this way forever.
