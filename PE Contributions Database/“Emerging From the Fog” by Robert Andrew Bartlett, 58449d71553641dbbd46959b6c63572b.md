**“Emerging From the Fog” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr. (Yankee Lawyer)**

In December, I felt a scratchy irritation in my throat. It was not sore enough to file a $5 medical request, just an annoyance that bore watching.

By mid January I was filing one medical request after another. The first time I actually made it to the infirmary was an officer-declared emergency. Nurse Tolman diagnosed my ailment as “viral crud” and prescribed generic over-the-counter cough syrup.

Not surprisingly, my condition grew worse. My violent fits of unproductive coughing and other signs and symptoms suggested mycoplasma pneumonia- formerly known as primary atypical pneumonia. The loss of appetite and ammonia-like taste of food when I did try to eat, blood test results and other signs and symptoms suggested kidney problems.

I’m a lawyer, not a doctor. Without a doctor to properly listen to my chest and take a throat culture, I couldn’t rule out SARS or a host of other infections, all life-threatening. Without additional blood tests (they love to draw blood here, and they did confirm abnormal levels of ketones and indicators of possible liver or kidney problems which they chose to ignore). I could not have given myself a specific and reliable diagnosis even if my brain had been functioning normally, which it was not.

I was operating in a fog. I was easily confused, frustrated, irritable, and tired. All I wanted to do was sleep, but I couldn’t afford a write up. In North Carolina, the hole isn’t 23/7, it’s 24/7 and occasionally fatal.

I’ve been filing sick call requests and grievances for five months so far, but haven’t been allowed to see a doctor about my problem yet. I am emerging from the fog, though. I filed a 42 U.S.C. 1983 complaint in the U.S. District Court las week. I’m able to take nourishment again but am still losing weight (about 30 pounds so far). A couple of months ago, I couldn’t complete an essay like this.

The sun will come out tomorrow.

It’s only a day away.
