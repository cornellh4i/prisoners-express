**“Believe It or Not” by Charles Higgins**

I’m no longer a person. In the failing eyes of society I ceased being a person and became a commodity. A dollar sign seen fit for the never ending procession of government money allocated to a business that has yet to decline in my lifetime. In my experience inside, it’s not designed to deteriorate it’s systematic abuse.

It’s not because we have the worst people in the world in our country. Rehabilitation to those who do stray waywards is minimal at least. If these doors ceased to revolve, the business of human commodity would come to a standstill. How would all those employed by these alleged defiant souls earn a living then>

I remember clearly the detailed history of how slavery became present. The description of the slave owners over their charges as they depicted them as unintelligent, often with crass and vulgar vocabulary. How eerily similar today is to yesterday. As we are labelled as prisoners and convicts, deemed to complete certain tasks to have an effective running business.

That brings us to some inevitable inquiries. Who feeds the population inside? Who cleans the business inside and out? Who handles the minute jobs like canteen and laundry? All the answers to why we are no longer people and only walking, talking commodities paid nil for those duties so vital to our oppressor’s business.

The ones who fail to apply themselves to appropriate those means, they have the option of a school or training course in some field beneficial to the structure of the system to be used anyways. Where the state is paid regardless of their succession rate. They’re paid per person attending, often by the mere signature of someone unaware of what they’re signing.

It’s happening whether you believe it or not. The average person, that boy from such a good family, we’re all lost how he became just another statistic. Whatever we as a society seen ages ago, did we see this coming...believe it or not.
