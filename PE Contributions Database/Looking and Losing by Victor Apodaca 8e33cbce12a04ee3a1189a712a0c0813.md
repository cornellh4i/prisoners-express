**“Looking and Losing” by Dr. Victor Andrew Apodaca Sr.**

That’s me. I see what I held in my hand was true to me, but I’m a dog, can’t you see? I had so many hands in mine but my dumb ass looked at the grass on the other side. They were smart, long, thin, petite, dainty, slim, but I had to taste the “forbidden fruit”; I wanted the taste of more than one apple…

Now alone in a deep dark place no one cares if my time comes to an end. I’d looked love in the face; it smiled, did some ungodly things to keep me home, but I saw that good piece of tail in the neighborhood, didn’t care yellow, black, pure white, some brown but mostly white, dirty little horny things that allowed one in the pink and two in the stink. “Wow.” That’s what I thought as they got the seven hour plow. When at home you had that cute petite perky blonde bombshell.

You saw that thing that showed off her wares hoping some fool would turn and look back as you wagged your tail as the mother of his kids stood in disbelief as your tongue fell down to your feet, looking back. Yes, the conquest was fun but now you’re in hell where there’s no beauty holding your hand except a pair of steel cuffs and they grab your thumbs to make it more hurtful when they would trip you just to watch you wiggle crying out in such unneeded pain. Why look at that thing that walked past you, when in your hand was your perfect playmate…?
