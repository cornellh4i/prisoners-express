**Untitled by Robert Allan Dziekan Jr.**

Sometimes I need to be humbled and put in my place, so I come here. When I sit here, surrounded by the vastness of the water and faced with the immensity of the mountains, I feel appropriately small. The magic of it is that my worries and troubles are made small, too.

I used to lay down under the clear night sky, looking up and into the infinite, but those waters were too vast, those mountains too high. Staring into that ocean of eternity, I go beyond feeling small; I feel an unhealthy insignificance. If I chased that rabbit down the hole, I might go insane. Here, though, it is a sense of the large I can live with. I can see its edges, its beginnings, and maybe it's endings. I can feel small without feeling like less than a speck. I can swim these waters and scale these mountains, but that’s part of what makes me feel like I matter less than what I thought I might. After all, if I drowned in all this water or fell to my death on those slopes, I might never be found. The world would continue to turn, never the wiser, and all my worries and troubles will have amounted to nothing.

Humbled, I look at that cleft between the mountains, and I wonder what lies beyond. Just think of it – for all that I can see on this side, there is even more to take in if I’m brave enough to swim into that valley, into the unknown. That, too, helps me to put things in perspective. That’s life, isn’t it? We’re easily paralyzes by all that surrounds us everyday, though we can see the future beyond, there is so much now to deal with that we don;t even begin to swim towards that valley. So, I muster my courage and imagine leaving all my troubles on this side, and see myself going into that valley. I picture myself leaving something behind beyond the mountains, something that will endure long after I’m gone. Legacy endures, and it begins now. I came here to remind myself of that. Come sit with me awhile.
