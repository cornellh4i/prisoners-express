**Zoo by Efren Hawkins**

This simple word shook up my world, because I didn’t truly know the meaning of the word. So, I looked it up and discovered what I’m living in. I’m surrounded by razor wire and I spend most of my time locked in a room on exhibition. Yeah, we are on display, because we alway on camera, which I feel is a tool used to be studied. We are fed like animals, because the trays are so sloppy that sometimes you can’t even eat it. Then when you say something, you're in the wrong as they say, “You better be glad we fed you.” I'll leave that thought in your mind.

Okay if the ghetto, housing project, and slum are concrete jungles. Prison must be the concrete zoo. When you come you are a trip of your honour like a lion who is no longer the “King of the jungle.” You lose your freedom like a monkey who can no longer swing on a vine. You lose something inside like a grizzly bear who can no longer search for food.

Me, I became what I am called. I’ve met some known by eight-five percent of wild animal names. My favorite one is Snake, because that name speaks for itself. Don’t get me wrong, because I earn my also. Yeah, I will watch you like a hawk, also with that name my mind does soar outside these walls as I hope and pray for a better day.
