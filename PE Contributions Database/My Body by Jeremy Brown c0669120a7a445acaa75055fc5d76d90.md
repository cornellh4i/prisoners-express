**My Body by Jeremy Brown**

“If what we focus on expands, never focus on how big your butt is getting, unless that is what you want!” Michelle Medrano

Brown curly hair. Brown eyes. Bronze skin. 135 pounds of athlete capability. A four pack on my way to a six pack. Arms 4 ½ feet long. 5’11” in height. And I’m flexible. I am also covered in tattoos head to toe except in sensitive areas. I’ve concussed my head 4 times. I’ve been stabbed, raped, kidnapped in a trunk, I’ve almost bled to death and yet I’m still alive. I’ve cut myself, stabbed myself, burned myself or my body and yet after all the demoralizing, dehumanization, I’m still alright after putting my body through hell, extreme amounts of pain, sexual abuse, and a number of other things I can’t say. I still have all my teeth, toes and fingers and sense of integrity. Actually it all sounds bad but all these things were isolated acts. My emotional body hurts more than the physical. Physical pain is always more temporary and easier to heal, emotional takes years, and I’ve healed that with deep states of meditation and hyperanalytricalization. I self regenerated 4 broken ribs and lower displacement of lower 3 lumbar, through Hatha Yoga and mental treatment of my own mind. I can do 75 push ups now straight on the first fun, sometimes 80. The human body is amazing, my body is amazing and it's only getting better. My body is a temple and I must treat it right after doing it wrong for so many years. They say prison preserves you. Yes it does but only if you take the steps to a better lifestyle. I feel so very sexy and so alive. Time to push further. I’m saying this in non-ego and-non arrogance. Definition, momentum, persevere.
