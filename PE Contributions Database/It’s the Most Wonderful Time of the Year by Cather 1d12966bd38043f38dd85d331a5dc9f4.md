**It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year by Catherine LaFleur**

It’s a special season here at Camp Prisoney Land. Once again audit time is here. Every year we get inspected by American Corrections Association. The same people who run private industry prisons where prisoners are purchased body and soul and forced to work for slave wages making clothes for the military or eyeglasses for public consumption. They gave accreditation to a prison which was condemned four years in a row by the health department.

My normal state is to be drowning in paperwork. I can’t be responsible for tracking all the forms. If not for Vivian, our law library secretary, we would be in serious trouble. She rescues us every year with her excellent attention to detail. All of the paperwork is mashalled into a monthly report, then labeled and filed in the Storage Room of Doom.

During the audit Vivian moves in, dragging me along to retrieve all the requested information from the last three years. Sometimes it’s seven years. We are a sorting team. This year we gathered everything in an hour, a new record. Only Vivian and I have access to the Doom Room. Not even the supervisor likes going there.

Last year, I had to do the audit without Vivian. Never again I swore, and yet here we are, together again, excavating the paperwork. Our new supervisor is all twitterpated about getting it right. Vivian and I keep moving forward each doing our part to rescue the library.

Of course we will pass. We always do.
