When I was young I always wanted to fit in. Be like somebody else. Or do the things that they did, which I thought was cool. Just to be part of their group, or to be liked by everybody else. I wasn't fitting in, I was filling in. The day I was born into this world I was fitting in to be part of this world and create my own destination. I'm already cool and part of a group that they call the Children of God. That was one purpose of being created -- seek knowledge of God from the cradle to the grave. I'm grown now and no longer want to be like somebody else. I want to be like myself and do things that are right, and not care who likes me cause I'm just fitting in.
