**by Steven P. Arthur**

I was no more than 7 years old when my Mom mussed up my platinum blonde hair which draped over my eyes, giving me the appearance of a shaggy dog. “Somebody needs a haircut.”

The following Saturday, I found myself walking into the barber shop, following my Dad closely. The rotating pole just outside the front door reminded me of a candy cane, and little did I know that the red and white stripes represented when barbers also did minor surgical procedures. The red and white stripes symbolized the rags, some stained with blood, hung out to dry after the surgery.

Inside the cool air-conditioned shop, the smells overwhelmed my still-developing and sensitive senses. The alcohol-based products stung my nose and eyes, while the shampoos and shaving creams reminded me more of Dad’s bathroom when he was getting ready to take Mom out on date night.

Up in the barber’s chair, with the always too tight paper collar around my neck, I looked like the world’s smallest priest. I waited patiently for the barber to drape the oversized apron over me and snap it closed behind my back so we could begin. I was usually a little nervous because the bright lights and unfamiliar adults in white uniforms were similar to those of doctor visits which usually involved some type of pain. However, Dad would put me at ease with his hazel eyes and easy smile, and so when I looked at him, I’d get an almost imperceptible nod of his head which acknowledged my existence and fear without embarrassing his

young man.

The worst part of the haircut was the anticipation of the electric clippers. The buzzing by my ears sent me into a frenzy of laughter and seizure-like spasms: the muscles of my neck and back would begin to hurt from the constant flexing and tension, but I couldn’t stop laughing no matter how painful the burn of them. It drove the barber crazy having to chase my little head around, but he held his good-natured smile and got the job done.

Afterwards, when the chase and laughter were over and the hair clippings were brushed off, I was released from the paper collar and apron. The barber stepped heavy on a pedal beneath my seat, and the chair dropped like an elevator toward the floor.

The barber would tell my dad that I was a good-looking, well-behaved boy: “bring him back anytime.”

My head felt lighter, and I’ll never forget how cool the outside breeze felt on my newly exposed skin when I first walked out the door.
