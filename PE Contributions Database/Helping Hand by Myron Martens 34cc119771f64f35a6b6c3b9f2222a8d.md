**Helping Hand by Myron Martens**

When I think of a helping hand, I consider those who have helped me in this journey through the DPS - state prison.

I think of my little sister, Shana, and my good friend and mentor Paul. Both of these loved ones have some to visit me and helped me in buying canteen from the store by putting money on my account. Because of their helping hand I’ve been able to buy food, drinks, hygiene products, whatever I need.

Last year, my son’s mom helped me tremendously: I guess she must have found someone else because now, I can’t even get a picture of my son. He’s my little man, an adorable five year old whom I love and miss so very much. She did send me some pictures last year though.

I must also consider the kind and generous men and women who run the very program which creates these word themes for us prisoners behind the walls. They give me ideas and things to write about, and other beneficial projects to work on and study. The Prisoner Express volunteer team, what a blessing and helping hand they truly are. They offer insightful, transformative reflection.

Finally, and above all else, I must thank God Almighty for his ever-loving present hand. God is my refuge and strength. My ever present helping hand in times of need. The might helping hand of God will never leave you or abandon you. A mighty fortress is my god. You are my helping hand and my deliverer, my god does not delay.
