**“Types and Theories: Quasi-Science” by J.C. Young**

****Generally, nicknames fall into the following categories:

1. Organically generated: These are communally attributed nicknames, usually based on other people’s perception of one’s character or inclination. These types of nicknames could derive from habit or an abnormality as perceived by others. For example, a person nicknamed “Stutterbox” may have a speech impediment, or “Skyscraper” may be reserved for a tall person. These types of nicknames may vary from the affectionate (Grandma) or the depreciating (bully), or by the gang.
2. Self-imposed: These are usually based on our perception of ourselves. These nicknames derive from an inflated sense of self-worth, or an alter-ego. These nicknames allude to a person’s psychology or moral standard. For example, a person who calls himself “Scarface” or “Capone” is most likely infatuated with the criminalistic lifestyle. As evident by many rap artists, like Scarface the rapper advocates selling drugs, or LL Cool J which stands for Ladies Love Cool James advocates promiscuity.
3. Displacement: These are temporary nicknames given to conceal a person’s true identity. Unlike the previous categories, these monikers are given to strangers in foreign areas, along with a conscious effort by the perpetrators to conceal his real identity. Additionally, unlike the other categories that could apply to anybody, these types of nicknames are reserved for the criminal element and those looking to evade accountability. For example, a guy that moves to Seattle with the intent to sell drugs would not give his “real” nickname but rather create a second nickname. Or a person running from the law, or the homies, would also be inclined to give a fake moniker.

Perhaps because I’m in prison, it’s refreshing to meet someone without a nickname. As opposed to “Big Liquor Sto,” plain ol’ “Josh” has an unpretentious feel to it. To me, nicknames are facades that people hide behind. The question becomes what makes a person feel the need to want to hide behind such facades. COuld it be shame? A sense of insecurity?

Such feelings of inadequacies--believe it or not--are actually fostered within our society. Radio and television constantly bombard us with the notion that we’re not complete in our natural state. In other words, females need makeup, guys need to shave and workout, the dog needs a collar, Susan needs the new cell phone, and Dad needs a sports car--all to feel complete. (Some cultures find the natural human scent erotic, something we find gag-inducing here.) Perhaps nicknames are the psychological manifestation of the seeds of inadequacies planted by the media and society To those that merely call it improvement, I say that they presuppose that there are inadequacies that require improvement.

So what am I saying? That you are perfect as you are, so do nothing to improve? No, of course not. I’m just saying that you’re alright, even without a nickname.
