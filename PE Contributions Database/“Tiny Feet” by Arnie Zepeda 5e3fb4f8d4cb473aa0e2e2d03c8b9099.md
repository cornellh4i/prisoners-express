**“Tiny Feet” by Arnie Zepeda**

I took a picture of these tiny feet because I knew no one would believe my story. But, as they say, “A picture is worth a thousand words”.

I was on my usual morning jog when I was suddenly flabbergasted, or maybe stupefied, no, I was dumbstruck. There’s in front of me, I could see two tiny feet pacing without a body. Incredibly, they were keeping a steady gait, as if they were being led by an invisible body.

Catching up to the tiny feet, they stopped dead in their tracks, as they say, and faced me. Strangely, if I took a step forward, they would take a step forward. If I took a step backward, they would take a step backward. Amazingly, they seemed to have a conscious will.

Continuing my jog, the tiny feet followed close behind; like a duckling that hatches next to a human believing it a parent. Undoubtedly a bird brain trait.

The tiny feet followed me all the way home. What could I do? I invited them in. My cat loved them and ran its tail provocatively over their toes, which they wiggled in approval.

Well, we became inseparable; wherever I went, the tiny feet followed. Yes, I attracted undue attraction, but it made for great conversation. And I met some really cute women, which was a plus.

I had become so attached to the tiny feet that I had actually bought several pairs of shoes for him/her, I didn’t know which. It seems he/she had a conscience. They would shy away from certain situations.

I thank my lucky stars for taking a picture of my tiny feet and maybe that’s why they left. I had become possessive, controlling, and overbearing. They must have felt stepped on.

I woke up one morning and they were gone. They simply walked away without a word.

All I have left is their picture.
