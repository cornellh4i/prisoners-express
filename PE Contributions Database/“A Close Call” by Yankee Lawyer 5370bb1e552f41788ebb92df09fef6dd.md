**“A Close Call” by Yankee Lawyer**

A Dodge minivan was following me...closely—too closely. Its front bumper was almost touching my rear wheel. Traffic was heavy that day, and sudden stops frequently lead to fender benders. I was on a bicycle with no insurance.

The driver was grinning like the Joker in a Batman comic. Her crime partner was sitting next to her.

I pulled off the road in front of someone’s garden. Pamela turned onto a side street, did a U-turn, and parked. We watched each other for a minute. I saw no sign of her gun, but I didn’t expect to until she was ready to fire it. We were playing a cat and mouse game in broad daylight, with many potential witnesses; but it was quite clear that she was the cat and I was the mouse. I crossed the lawn and went up to the front door of a two-story wooden house and rang the bell. A sixty-ish white man answered, refused to let me use the phone, and closed the door again.

This was not the first time Pamela and Glenda had tried to kill me since my now-estranged wife had secretly purchased that ridiculously large insurance policy on my life. As always, I prayed for deliverance or a quick and painless death, and asked God to look after my children. His answer this time was immediate, and more positive than that of the heartless owner of the lawn I was standing on. I flagged down the police car He sent my way, but when I tried to point out my ex’s minivan, it was gone.

I made it to work alive and on time.

Three and a half years of my life were like that. My parents and some other potential witnesses lost their lives. Pamela was held in contempt of court once but never prosecuted. I survived as a political prisoner, divorced and disbarred but still alive. That was a Close Call.
