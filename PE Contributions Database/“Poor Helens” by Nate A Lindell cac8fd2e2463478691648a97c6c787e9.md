**“Poor Helens” by Nate A. Lindell**

Helen Keller was blind and deaf. In her autobiography she said that before she met the teacher who taught her sign language by touch, she knew nothing; she didn’t even know that she existed. (The movie about Helen Keller revealed the stunning moment when Helen learned her first word, “water,” when she felt cold hand-pumped water gushing over her hands as her teacher pressed the sign for water into Helen’s hand.)

Lack of language left Helen’s mind an abyss of indistinguishable chaos. Language enabled her to categorize things, sort them, make sense of them, thus Helen’s self hood was able to emerge from her fog of ignorance.

Had Helen’s parents not been wealthy and not cared for her enough to pay for a personal teacher, almost certainly Helen would not have matured beyond the emotionally disturbed problem child (the result of her ignorance) she was into the insightful, intelligent woman that she became. It’s likely that she would have been put in a mental asylum (hellholes in her day) if her parents had been poor or not cared.

Due to their lack of education (self or formal), most of those around us don’t even realize that they are like poor Helens: their intellectual/cognitive development has been stunted so that they can’t be rehabilitated because they’ve never been “habilitated” in the first place! This is often the case with men or women born addicted to drugs, raised in a violent/abusive or neglectful home or neighborhood, whose families or communities lacked the resources or regard needed to facilitate healthy development, which minimizes the warp in personalities, even personalities genetically predisposed to warp.

Those of us with at least a glimmer of self-understanding, usually developed with no help from prisoncrats, intuit this, although we can assume that our experience being maldeveloped is “unique,” that we are especially fucked up. In some cases, that may be so, yet consider what you might have in common with my experiences and consider the possibility of you rising above your own past, into a higher state of being, with those pursuing the same, which is what a healthy society consists of.

On the Adverse Childhood Experiences (A.C.E.) survey, I score a perfect 10. That means I’m highly likely to die from cancer, a heart attack, or a violent crime, and the fact that I’m in prison for murder is typical- also, I should be crazier than I am. (P.T.S.D. is a problem- people scare me and I hurt them, bad. Sometimes I feel anointed to punish bullies…).

Now, the horror movie that was my childhood took place in rural areas and small towns. Yours might have taken place in the ghetto or even another planet (joking!), but I ask you to consider the possibility that we had similar hardships and have similar hardships. If my adamant will to understand myself and the world can lead to me gaining some of that understanding, maybe such a will can work for you; maybe you, like a phoenix, can rise out of the ashes of your past and escape the grip of those who, intentionally or from their own ignorance, damaged you.

It takes some balls/ovaries to see yourself for what you truly are, and only then can you see what needs improving.

Best of luck!
