**“Lake Wateree” by Jack Simpson**

The wind blew steady across the lake. Not a strong breeze, one that just rustled the reeds standing in the shallows. All the boaters sat silent in a row. Awaiting for the one chance to bag the largest or the most first for the day. All eyes watched the shore with hands on the keys and steering wheels. Everyone was tense. The boat we had was borrowed and it had just come out of the shop. The motor had been reworked, tuned to perfection. Fuel was mixed and filled to the top. We were told it was 100% in working order.

It was seven AM and the shot fired to start the crappie tournament. The main prize was a jon boat, motor, and trailer. Names would be called out of a pot for the winner. Prizes were awarded for the most fish by weight. We both had our hearts on the main prize.

Everyone who paid to fish had to be in by three PM. The boats flew up out of the water with their noises in the air. Then settled down with speed and was out of sight. We were the last to leave, I had turned my hat around with hopes of not losing it. It could have stayed turned the right way. I looked to see if the anchor was in the water. Then checked to see if we were stuck on the bottom. I picked up the paddle and stroked it a couple times in the water. We began to move. From that, I knew we were in trouble.

By that time we had reached the area we wanted to fish. It was almost an hour later than we had hoped. The fish don’t know about time, at least we hoped so. The fish were slow and just weren’t any size. The time for us to head back would be soon and with no more fish than we had. It sure wasn’t going to be a productive day.

Using the motor would be a waste of time. So with a paddle in hand we headed back. Sure, if the motor would have done its job we would have been to more places. I watched as my friend had a look that said that he was wishing for a speed boat. I felt the same way also. Boaters raced up and down the lake pointing laughing. We still hadn’t gotten too far away from the landing. The best we figured was at least one hundred yards. Still, we were not defeated, it was anybody’s chance to win the boat. I still could see the look of worry of giving up in his eyes. For a few more smiles, I would have dove in the lake and took a swim. What stopped me was the cold temp. It was not above forty degrees.

Things were about to look up. For some reason we caught a head wind. It pushed us back in the same direction we had just left. No matter how hard we paddled it still kept pushing the boat. Even if we did fire the motor off, all it would do is just make noise. I do believe I could have pushed the boat by foot. Only if I could have found the bottom.

To our surprise the boat ended up a couple hundred yards from where we had left. I had fished this area by myself a good time back. Using minnows and jigs did not produce even a bite much less a fish. For a couple minutes we sat and chewed the fat (and talked). We never even thought about the fish.

The wind died down and the sun began to heat up. Today the weather-man had said it would be in the sixties. This is my kind of weather. I pulled my shirt off to get an early start on my tan. I sat back as if I had no care in the world. It didn’t take long before my eyes closed. I was dreaming of a bass boat with the wind blowing through my hair. The live wells were full of fish and for one I was happy. Soon I would reach the boat ramp. As I turned the boat and slowed down, the dock was in sight.

Something hit me in the chest. I was awake. “Hey goofball?”

“You’re going to let the fish get away?” Joe asked. As he stated I had a fish, not one but two. Both poles were being pulled sideways from the boat.

“Hey Joe!” How about a little help here. No-way, I am catching fish as well. For what seemed like an hour we pulled fish in. Only a few made it back into the water. For once we were still in the game and felt like we had a chance at the main prize. We still had to beat the timeline. It was getting close to one PM.

Our stringer was full of the largest crappie I had seen in a long time. We had to put three fish on the metal clamps that held them closed. It was so full I was in fear of losing them before we reached the landing. I made a suggestion that we place the fish in the boat before we left to head back. For some reason he liked the idea. At least until we started back.

I started to paddle and we were on our way. The wind stayed calm and soon could feel the wind on our faces. This came from the boat moving forward from the paddling, not get it mixed up with the motor running.If anything could go wrong, it was about to happen. Joe decided to try the motor. At the first pill, it was too late to yell “NO”. The motor caught and it was already in gear. The prop cut the stringers into. All the fish we had caught were gone. All I could do was hold my head down, not to even look at the rear of the boat. Joe couldn’t say a word. He was quiet as he shut the motor off. Pulling the metal chain and that was all we had left of the catch of the fay. All the fish were history. At least for this trip. We headed back and soon found out the boat was gliding through the water. There wasn’t much talk on the way back. We seemed to get there faster this time. For once the wind had seemed to be our friend. It really surprised me that the landing had come into view so fast. Most of the other boaters passed by us and some were weighing in. All we still had was the chain from the cut stringers.

As you would figure it. The two of us were defeated, sunburned, hungry, tired, and had no fish. I held my head high, carrying the useless stingers in my hand. There were a few laughs, while others pointed.

Joe on the other hand looked like he lost his best friend. I heard him say,

“Yeah! Yeah!” So we didn’t win. We came in last. “No big deal,” Joe said. There is always next year.

All right everyone settle down. The drawing for the boat, trailer, and motor will begin. We watched as the name was pulled, I turned to walk away. Jor was already at his truck. Our names were called. We, “Won!”

We pulled the boat on the trailer that Joe had borrowed. Hanging on the back of the motor was the fish we thought we had lost at Lake Wateree. We won twice that day.
