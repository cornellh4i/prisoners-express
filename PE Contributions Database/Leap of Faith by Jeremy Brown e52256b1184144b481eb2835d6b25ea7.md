I was in track and field when I was in highschool. I was faster and had more endurance than anyone. Smoking is what held me back. Those damn cigarettes. My first time winning a medal was for third place. The rush I felt, and the applause was more wonderful to me than anything I could’ve imagined. I didn’t care about medals. It was the discipline and accomplishment that mattered.
