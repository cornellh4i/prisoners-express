**“When life gives you choices, make good decisions” by James D. Wisner**

We’re given many things in life and choices are one of them. Some choices are small and insignificant; while others command prominence in our lives. We can look back on our past and see the path our choices have led us down. Standing upon the greatest vantage point, tomorrow, we can clearly discern the quality of our choices. Thaat’s the catch, it’s hindsight. One in particular stands out from the rest. It will have such an effect that the shock waves shall be felt for years to come. This decision was made in the fledgling hours of October 4, 2014. Clearly this life changing event was the culmination of about fourteen years of bad choices. I had been subconsciously grooming myself all these years to make the wrong choice on that day. It was the day I decided to steal twenty one guns. And as all bad decisions tend to do, it led to another horrendous display of decision making skill. What was this display you ask? Well it was the logical choice to try and sell those guns. Now if it wasn’t enough that people in my life were trying to get me to shape up and be successful in life, even Facebook was hinting that I should think this deal through. I came across as post that talked about Mercury being in retrograde around this time. And if you didn’t know when Mercury is in retrograde, you don’t make any life altering decision or business deals. I did not heed this sage advice delivered by the all knowing social media giant, or any warning for that matter. In my mind, the plan I had concocted was perfect. So perfect in fact, that I was already spending those imaginary dollars. As I look back, from my vantage point and realize nothing on earth could have changed my mind. This bad choice had an interesting side effect though. Because of the seven years I received for my crimes, I was given a tremendous amount of time for introspection. This had led to a plan and direction for my life that was absent all those previous years. I had just been floating through life till that point. I was indifferent towards my future and ambivalent towards success of any kind. Now the next seven years after my release are planned out. I have contingencies if my plans fail. This is no longer just a joyride for me. There is another passenger in this car now. She has been a catalyst for this dramatic change that’s gone through me. Her success is directly tied to my own. And for her to have the best chance at creating her best life that she can’ she is going to need a good foundation to start from. Luckily I have had a tremendous amount of help in making sure her early years are filled with love and a proper place to grow up in my absence. This is all about choosing what’s important to you. Those things change over time as we grow up. The main idea should not change: to provide for the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for you and yours. I plan to have a better life than my parents did, in the hopes that my daughter can do the same. And so on down the line. That’s me deciding to work towards betterment of my family for future generations. I have rediscovered the tools to make good decisions that were imbued in me by my parents. I had the ability all along; I just failed to use them.
