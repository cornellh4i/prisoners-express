**by Brad Perkins**

Imagine if you will, a long haired/heavy metal grunge/slackers with the red eyes and a perpetual cough in all his glory in the early 1990’s, rolling out of bed in the afternoon and digging through the (not quite) clean clothes pile for the least stained pizza uniform he could find in the five minutes available before he was late once again to help make America’s favorite pizza for the blue collar factory workers and trailer park dwellers of a white trash town buried in the depths of the cultural armpit of this great nation.

Uniform on, cigarette lit searching for the roach that fell on my lap the night before - dammit it has to be here somewhere--okay there it is, just about done by the time the old ‘79 Firebird pulls into the parking lot. Damn I’m late again.

Brutal Friday night almost over, toppings everywhere wait, dammit are those the kids from last week, the ones who come in at the last moment before we shut the doors and stay an hour late with their baboon ass red uniforms touting their small town football prowess laughing at it up as they debauch their big haired acne prone little hotties and trash the place we just cleaned. Oh well nothing a little floor sweepings and maybe a little spit in the sauce won’t help.

Alice the manager has to go like usual, the grocery store won’t cash her after 9 and the crack dealer does not take checks so why not leave the guy from the work release in charge so he can go out into the parking lot with his “wife” and do things I suspect have nothing to do with his “wife” and do things I suspect have nothing to do with making pizza. It’s okay. There are two 16 year olds watching the place and serving the beer and protecting the reputation of this valued American institution…

They finally gone? Good, let’s load these pizzas down to where they nearly collapse the boxes and fill these plastic tumblers to the rim with this draft beer, sweep the scraps under the make table on the Alpine - got me another twisted and rolling away from another adventure at my first job.
