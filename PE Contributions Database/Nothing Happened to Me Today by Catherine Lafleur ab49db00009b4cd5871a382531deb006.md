**Nothing Happened to Me Today by Catherine Lafleur**

Sergeant Hemp grabs Wren  by the shoulders, picks her up and slams her face first into the asphalt. Blood splatters up onto the Warden’s silk pantsuit. Wren lies face-down on moving, her legs and arms Twisted behind her.  Hemp Yanks her up by the cuffed wrists, Switzer over and pepper sprays. Red marks the lower half of her face and her jaw hangs at an angle. Wren starts screaming as the capsaicin burns her eyes.  The warden strides away. Another officer runs up and snatches Wren  upright then drags her away, knee scraping the ground and leaving long bloody trails on the gray asphalt.

My family doesn't want to hear such things. During a phone call later that night, I mentioned nothing of what I witnessed. I give a few general details about a shipment of books the boss received. I'm asked the usual questions, am I still working in the law library, do I have enough money for the canteen, how are my feet holding up, and most importantly, did anything happen to me today. I'm very careful to say nothing of Wren.

The next day, I am standing in line about the spot where Wren was taken down.  the blood is gone, washed by a summer rain.  My right shoe has a big split across it's rubber sole and a pebble has lodged itself. Can't shake it loose, it's wedged right in the crack.  So uncomfortable. I hobble on the side of my foot into the library and to my desk. Flipping the sole up, I can just see the White Rock in the split. I pry it out with a pencil. It's not a rock. It's Wren’s broken tooth. Really, nothing happened to me today.
