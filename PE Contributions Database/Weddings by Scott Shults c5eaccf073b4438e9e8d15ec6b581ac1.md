**Weddings            by Scott Shults**

Universes overlap.

Worlds collide.

Stardust is flung in every direction through space.

Time doesn’t matter.

Directions do not limit.

Through some mystery of cosmic energy, somehow, someway the pieces that know one another reconnect.

Millions of years pass.

Thousands of lives get lived.

The energies reborn and reformed anew have never forgotten one another.

Energies learn from every connection.

Every connection leads to a purpose.

Teams exist, in every form, to pursue goals.

To complete certain goals, some of us have partners.

Our energies never forget.

We’ve wedded before.

We will again.
