**“Native Princess” by Eric L. Webb**

Do, dee, do, do, deeeeee, do, doooooo!

Oh, hey there! What are you doing out here? Wassup! My name is Mia, umm, I guess. I’m just a princess playing a Native ceremonial chanting flute, wearing a luxurious fur cheetah princess cloak in the woods for no apparent reason! Am I bothering you?

… Hahaha, nawww, okay, truth be told momma kicked me out of the house because she says I drive her nuts through the paper thin walls. Okay, number one, I’m not the one who bought a trailer, and number two, my uncle Tom Redcloud who says I’m a Princess and is super fun because he dances in the annual Native American festival outside of town told me if I learn to play beautifully, the animals of the forest will come to listen and be guided by the love of the Great Spirit.

He also told me over the phone not to be upset because my mom (his sister) is a “malicious nag” who could never dance very well at Pow Wows and is just jealous of my world class flute skills and to never give up. I think he’s on the phone with her now because he said he’d call her and I can hear her screaming right now at someone else in the house.
