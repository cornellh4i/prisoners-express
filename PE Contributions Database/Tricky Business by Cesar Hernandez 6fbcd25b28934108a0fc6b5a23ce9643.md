**Tricky Business by Cesar Hernandez**

They say it’s not adultery if you’re not wearing your wedding ring. My friend Becca says we need to have lunch. I pick her up at her office. She has her purse and laptop case with her.

Becca insists on Nordstrom Cafe. I counter with Stephen Pyles. Stephen Pyles is close and I can get served promptly. She wants Nordstrom. I call my office and tell them I’m having a long lunch.

We valet park and go inside Nordstrom. Becca knows the manager, so we’re instantly seated. Lunch is great, we discuss lots of things. After lunch, she says she needs to do some shopping. I tell her I need to get back to my office. Becca reminds me that I told my office I was taking a long lunch.

Becca heads for the lingerie section. She says I should buy her something nice. I tell her she has to model for me. I don’t buy a woman lingerie if she doesn’t model it for me. She says nothing. She picks out some very nice things. She says she has a trip coming up and wants to make sure she has new lingerie. She pays with her American Express Business Platinum charge card, I tell her it must be nice to have an expense account. She simply smiles, I ask her why she didn’t pay for our three hundred dollar lunch. She says that was not a business expense, but yet somehow lingerie is a valid business expense.

We drive back to her office. I drop her off at her Maserati where she puts all her shopping bags in her trunk. I drive back to my office. Since lunch runs so long, I stay a little late.

I’m about five minutes from home when Becca calls. She says she forgot her purse and laptop in my car. They are behind the passenger seat. Becca says she needs her purse and laptop. I tell her I’ll drop it off at her office tomorrow. She tells me to look in her purse. In her purse is her passport and her plane ticket for Europe.

I haven’t seen Becca’s new place yet. She tells me where it is. I call my wife and tell her we are swamped at the office. I tell my wife I’ll be late getting home. Becca’s place is a little far.

I arrive and call Becca to come get her stuff. She tells me to come up. Her unit’s on the tenth floor, so she comes to her balcony in her robe. She drops her keys to the ground. I use the electronic key to get inside the building.

I walk in and Becca is wearing the nice blue lingerie she bought at Nordstrom today. It looks very good on her. I make a half-hearted attempt to leave. Becca says its not adultery if you’re not wearing your wedding ring. Becca takes off my wedding ring and puts it in the key bowl.

Afterwards, I stop by the health club. I can’t arrive home with Becca’s scent on me. I use lots of Dial body wash so my wife will know I was at the health club.

I drive home and tell my wife I stopped at the health club after leaving the office.
