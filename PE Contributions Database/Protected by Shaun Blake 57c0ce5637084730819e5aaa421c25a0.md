**“Protected” By Shaun Blake**

About thirteen years ago things became clearer to me; for the first time in my life I didn’t despise myself. I decided to stay human(e). I softened inside. The system may have hold of my worldly instincts-my emotions, I found, are mine alone. I just needed them to learn how to keep them conscious.

One of the terrible things the American justice system has tried to do is persuade us that mere impulses, “mere” feelings, are of no account. While at the same time robbing us of our power over our natural world: What we feel or don’t feel, what we do or don’t do, makes no difference anymore. They try to make us vanish, and not be heard from again. To banish us from the stream of history.

All of society should question this.

Our personal relationships and seemingly helpless gestures are what really matter; an empathetic gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word of compassion...have value and power. We might not be able to stop our societal death once here; we’re now without normal power, if they could make us stop loving, that would be the real tragedy. They can’t do that. It’s the one thing they can’t do. They can make us say anything, but they can’t make us believe it. They can’t get inside us. No, if we can feel that staying human(e) is worthwhile, even when it can’t have any worthwhile result in our external environment we have beaten them.

They can spy on us, control us physically, manipulate our actions and thoughts, but if we keep our heads we can still outwit them. With all their cleverness they never understood how to master controlling what another human being is truly feeling. Because there isn’t a way of doing this. We may give this information temporarily, it can’t be taken.

Gradual wearing down by sleeplessness, solitude, constant light or darkness, deprecation of human(e) needs can be inflicted, but if our objective is to stay human(e)-stay emotional beings- what difference does it ultimately make? They can’t alter our emotions. They can lay bare everything that we have done or said or thought; but our inner hearts, our true essences, remain protected inside. Our emotional independence is irrevocable. Our protection. I know this truth. We all need to learn it.
