**Prisoner Lives Matter by Michael Oakleaf**

Do black or brown lives matter? Do female or LGBTQ lives matter? How about Islamic, Jewish, or Christian lives? If we have to ask or must remind one another of our value, then we are surely living in a society in which no life matters. For no life can or will really matter until each and every single life matters, regardless of whatever variations of humanity we possess. SoÂ  if the lives of those who are created differently by God do not matter, then how can my life, the life of a person who has made inappropriate and hurtful choices, matter?

Of course, I do not blame society for my choices or my situation. It simply reflects the thinking, beliefs, attitudes, and values of the majority of its members. Each one of us has the freedom and ability to choose something different, something better, for ourselves, our country, and-maybe even- our children and our children's children. If we do not learn to respect and value each other, then your life may end like mine, which is a good example of how the type of thinking creates a destructive cycle that undermines the worth and well-being of all lives.

At a very young age, I developed a belief that some lives, some individuals, are less valuable than others. I began with judging, objectifying, and hating myself, and that became the basis for judging, objectifying, and rejecting or accepting others. With my lack of respect for certain human characteristics, I gave myself permission to disrespect, dehumanize, and abuse good people. Because I did not respect and value my life and the lives of others, I became a man who dehumanized and hurt the people around him, including his family and the people who cared about him. Now I cannot undo or fix the harm I have done. I have lost my family, friends, freedom, career, and everything I had, and I am not sure that my life will ever have the opportunity to really matter.
