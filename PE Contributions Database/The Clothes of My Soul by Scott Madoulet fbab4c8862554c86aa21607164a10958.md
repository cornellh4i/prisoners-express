**The Clothes of My Soul by Scott Madoulet**

My life is over.

I held the power of life or death, love or hate, good or evil, peace or chaos, right or wrong in my hand. Coerced and wallowing in corruption, I chose poorly. I chose wrong. I chose chaos. I chose evil. I chose hate. I chose death. Too bad for me, death comes slow to practitioners of iniquity. This is my life now.

We reap what we sow, right? If only I could mend myself, make my colors bright again, bathe myself with hyssop and clean myself white. But what's the use? Once I return to the world my colors will fade, my white will become dingy, the clothes of my soul will be torn. Once again, the need to mend and cleanse and brighten and make new will be obvious. The world wears down a man's resolve. Once you cross the line it's easier crossed the second time, that's why killers are executed. Although there are worse things you can do to the people we love than kill them. And from in here, how can a man amend his past actions anyway? I can't!! I can't do anything. And maybe you don't go to hell for the things you do; maybe you go to hell for the things you don't do. Or can't do. This is my life now.

I'm glad I was found out. I really am. I think I always hoped someone would tell. It's nice not to have any secrets anymore. We all like to think we are so good, but we're not. In fact, if people really knew our secrets, we think we would kill ourselves from the shame. That's not the case. People found me out and I'm still here. I'm still me, broken as ever!! Of course I'm now in prison, but I no longer have anything to hide. And yes, I'm terribly remorseful for hurting all those people. I'm not that broken!! Thankfully, the shame has run its course for now. It's easy not to be ashamed when you live with wife beaters, child abusers, rapists, and murderers. So now I avoid living. I watch others live. I take notes. I write poems. I write nonsense. I puke out all the emotions I've for so long stuff down, afraid to experience. Accept the guilt. The guilt I hang onto. I Revel in it. I put on the guilt like deodorant, I like aftershave. So everyone can smell the Old Spice if my guilt. This is my life now.

it's nothing perfect or complete, but this is what my new life is made of. I have become Pavlov's dog, hurting those I love just as those that loved me trained me to do. And this, my new life, just gets more miserable in ways I never imagined. What I have left, maybe the only way to find some semblance of freedom, is to do the things I don't want to do. I need to rebel against my selfishness. It's the opposite of following my bliss. I need to do what I fear the most: surrender? Admit defeat? Ask for help? Tell someone that I'm afraid... This is my life now.

Imperfect and messy, this is the world I live in. This far from home, these people I'm put with, the only people who know me, hate me. We all hate each other. This whole world is my enemy. Welcome to Hell, Scott! My life is over. I killed it. This is my new life now.
