**“Blink of an Eye” by Jaime Marrero**

Time is precious. In a moment, anything and everything may happen. A simple moment of anger, a change in direction, or an unweighted decision can instantly change the plans that we have for our life. This is a fact that I live with, with every breath that I take.

It seems like yesterday that I was in the streets raising my 5 year old son. My memories of this joyous time in my life are so fresh. However joyous that time may have been, it was brought to a halt in the blink of an eye. My lifestyle of fast money and drugs quickly turned my life upside down. My pride as a “man” was my downfall. I wanted to be seen as a no nonsense tough guy. This image came at a cost which cost me 38 years of my life and my fatherhood. I took a man’s life while in a drug-induced stupor and in that reckless moment, ruined that man’s life along with my own.

I had a disturbed idea about liberty, and I did not respect it. I felt as if the world owed me and the only thing that I had to do to earn it was take it. How disturbing is that! I actually had myself fooled into believing that I was a good father because I used my “earnings” to support my son.

I became a man during my incarceration. By losing my freedom, I was forced into respecting and cherishing my liberties. I also learned the true meaning of love and family. I also learned compassion, and remorse after seeing the pain that I caused the family of the man’s life that I took and the pain that I caused my own family.

Now that I’m here in prison, I see the same attitude in the younger guys that are getting locked up. Sadly, I also see some older guys’ refusal to see the error of their ways.
