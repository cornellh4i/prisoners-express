**Cave and Calvin by Raul Aguayo**

Calvin took a deep breath. He felt his lungs expand, as if for the first time, with cool crisp air. The kind of air you can only catch from the wind. The kind that hopes to sweep past and grabs at your hair with tiny hands on its way to somewhere. The light above revealed a world full of potential.

How long? How long was he in the cave? He could not recall. It had cared for him. It gave him air to breath, it had the scent of earth. The cave gave him water to drink, in the silent dark it plinked and plunked into shallow pools. The cave had given him food to eat, the mosses and critters sufficed.

But the earthy air hung on a noose; the stony drink chilled and hardened his bones, and the food she gave left Calvin wanting. It was time to go. One step in the dark towards a hopeful light. And she hated him for it. Cave would see him undone before she would let him leave.

He had been her warmth. When she shivered he held onto her walls to soothe her. When she cried he drank her tears in sympathy. When she roared in anger, Calvin whispered a prayer for her. But it was a lie, wasn’t it? He never loved her like she did. That’s why he’s leaving.

Calvin felt as if on a ledge. As he walked towards the opening, Cave was determined to stop him. She tilted the rock he stepped on nearly breaking his ankle. Calvin reached for balance and was met with sharp stone. He took another step and slid into a slick pond. He felt his tailbone crash against the unforgiving cave floor. He heard himself grunt as he gathered his thoughts. His wet clothing hung off of him like rotten flesh and Calvin wept at his futility. “I’m not going to make it.” This certainty crept into him like an earwig and feasted on his confidence.

Still the light beckoned.

On he went with bloodied hands and bloodied knees. The dead cold of Cave was on him like a glacier as Calvin slowly pulled away. His steps were rigid and unsure. Every hand hold was not to be trusted. Cave had taken his breath, turned him numb and nearly crippled him. But Calvin began to feel hope.

The opening was near; only meters away and Calvin noticed activity in the air. He squawked as the wall gave away, but remained upright. He had made it and the outside was beautiful. His last step in the cave rested on a boulder and he massaged feeling into his knee.

Somewhere back, deep in Cave, a dislodged rock caused a cave in. But Calvin stood nonplussed and stole the passing wind into himself. It had the scent of atmosphere somewhere miles up in the sky.
