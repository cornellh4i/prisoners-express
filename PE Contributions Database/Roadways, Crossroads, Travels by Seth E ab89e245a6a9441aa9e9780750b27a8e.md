**Roadways, Crossroads, Travels by Seth E**

After all this time, the last leg of my journey spread out before me. In a few weeks I’d be through the pass and on the final span of the roadway that would bring me back to civilization. Assuming, of course, that I’d survive the wastelands for that time.

An occasional encounter with danger was a given, and after ten months on the road I’d learned the ways to avoid, or at least minimize chances of, most dangers. Tips and aid from fellow travellers had taught me most of what I’d needed to learn, and the occasional “trial by fire” had been an invaluable tool as well. My failures were my greatest source of education, and if I lost a bit here and there- supplies stolen by late night scavengers, a finger to a disagreeable predator, and so on- I called it tuition and took the lesson to heart.

Sometimes, though, I wondered if I’d taken a much harder road than was strictly necessary. The options at crossroads always seem so full of potentials, both ease and hardship, and the advice of fellow travelers was only so useful- one could heed sound warnings of jackals on one road, taking the other, only to find that there were jackals there, too. Maybe even the same band of them, for all I could know.

Of course, a kindly fellow traveler could just as often be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. In the Before times, an ancient song had it right. Beware the pat on the back- it just might hold you back. Nowadays, though, just when you’d come to trust a road friend, they’d pull the blade, or run off in the dark with your water. An animal looking to take a bite of my flesh, or to steal away with some jerky. That I can understand, accept. But when a fellow traveler crosses me, it burns. On occasion, I’ve followed them, hunted them down. I’m ashamed of the animal I become when I’ve done that. But then again, when word spreads of such deeds, it means the next traitor will think again before crossing me, or anything else, perhaps.

One of the best road friends I ever had, she said we were living in a state of anarchy, but she didn’t mean it negatively. She-Alexis- told me that she preferred the road to any city. “In a true anarchy” she explained, “the would-be bully knows that their fellows have as much freedom as he does to stab or betray, and this breeds caution, which is what makes good neighbors.”

“I thought fences made good neighbors,” I’d responded. She smiled, shrugged.

“What the fence represents is what makes a good neighbor,” she went on. “A fence is a boundary its a clear line that says ‘you over there, me over here.’ The potential for me to stab your eyes out if you try to harm me is another kind of boundary, the boundary of consequences.” She drew a line in the dirt between us as we sat around our small fire. “You won’t cross this line if you can assume it might cause violence, so you don’t cross- you are a good neighbor.”

“But anarchy,” I protested, “doesn’t it just mean ‘bugger your line, I do what I want?’ No laws, right? So your law against me crossing that line, isn’t that not anarchy?”

“Anarchy is not the absence of laws,” she denied, “but the ultimate individualism of law. No courts, no police, no politics- just me and you acknowledging our mutual sovereignty. And I have fought too long for my sovereignty to give it up again. I quite like being queen of myself.”

Of course, she wasn’t inclined to travel to cities with me, so we parted ways. Still, I respect her choice. It isn’t for me, but who can say if she’s wrong? Not I.

Still, I think often of Queen Alexis, and I wonder now and then if I will maybe be a bit too… sovereign for a city. With everything I’ve sacrifice to get this far, and with these last couple months of travel to complete- all through the most challenging terrain, I might add- will I be able to cope with civilization again? Will I chafe under the restraints of social norms, of a landlord, a magistrate, the city watch, and all the little expectations of “proper behavior” one finds in “civilized” places? Will the nice people of the town smell the stink of the road on me, will they see the dirt and scars, and think “savage”?

Well… perhaps I am a bit savage now. King Savage maybe, eh? We shall see.
