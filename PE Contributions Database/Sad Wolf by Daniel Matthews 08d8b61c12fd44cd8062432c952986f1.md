**Sad Wolf by Daniel Matthews**

Sad wolf searching again. Always searching for another one that looks just like her. Somebody who reminds him of her. Born in winter. But he loves them all, every imprint, he just can’t forget her. So provoking. Laziness is a narrow bridge. A frosted forest.

The sad wolf can’t help falling in love again. Instantly. Frozen. His liveliness in the images of frozen water mirror of his territory. Capturing time. Chasing stillness. Surrounded by sensation and delusion. Finding himself lost again.

There also are the ones he sees out. The ones he wants to fall in love with. To cry. To show them, to show her, that he’s vulnerable...but they already know. And so he keeps searching. Who wants to love him because he is fragile? The sad wolf. His name misery. His fur dark. His world cold.

She the one who broke him, leaving fractures mirrors and tundras to walk upon. His soul cries because he is a soul. Her soul gone because she is a soul. She is a soul, shattered. Splintering icy glass. Forever. They don’t have to say anything , the ones he wants to love but know only resemble her, won’t; can’t; love him too this way.

His dreams take him to her. She’s there. She ties him to a heart. He takes her to her dreams, but tragedy always ruins them in the end. Never to be seen again. One of them disappears. And again the sad wolf seeks out his love. Wherever she may dream.

But is she sad too? The heart that never had the chance to grow wants to know. Left alone, cold and buried in the snow, to never have a chance. Stops beating to be alone. So that it won’t become broken.

Crushed hunger, wasted hopes, ruined dreams, and the emotion of ghosts. A past that surfaces unforgotten, why? The wolf can’t help being wounded, it comes whenever he meets one like her. Never to speak. Playwriting the traumatic emotion of the world. Dreaming. The sad wolf.
