**"Practical Joke"** **by Lathon Jordana**

I did a lot of research and thinking about this. To start off, I looked up "practical joke" in Webster’s Dictionary then thought about my life, mainly concerning my relationship with others. All that stuck out was my relationship with my wife, our so-called family that only tolerates me, people I considered friends and the psychiatrist that diagnosed me with psychotic disorder NOS. I have symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar, and I am not that smart and have plenty of faults. I do have plenty of love, respect, and empathy for others. As I repent to God/Allah for my sins, here is my story of a practical joke.

A practical joke, according to the Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (copyright 1981), is a joke whose humor stems from the tricking or abuse of an individual placed somehow at a disadvantage. My wife and I both had a hard childhood, but both of us said that we did not want to live or be apart of our marriage any longer because it is not productive. We had a plan to build and better ourselves, to give our kids a better life, and for us to experience a type of happiness and peace that we haven’t had in our lives. I failed our family by mistake, and it hurts me deeply since I am sure my actions hurt or damaged every mind and heart of the family. While I did not lie about my deeds, I accidentally caused our two years and nine-month-old daughter’s death.

She was sick with the common cold and pink eye. I was twenty years old doing my best to cook a family meal, keep the house clean, and care for my sick child that day. It was difficult to keep her eyes washed and get her to take that cough medicine, and so I spanked her. That could possibly be defined as abusive. By my upbringing and thinking I didn’t think it was. My daughter was breathing when I called 911 for help. She died the next day. I never thought it would have killed her. For nine years, I have been in prison and must do 12 more to be eligible for parole. I have been around some real monsters, and I do my best not to change for the worst. I want to survive, but not at the price of losing my morals, spirit, and soul. I believe that my family’s lack of investment in my success, limiting my potential, is a practical joke. But it’s all okay.

It’s okay because I live for God/Allah. I strive to be righteous and pray this story filled someone’s heart. Never give up on doing right and being great, no matter how crazy others say, or lie, that you are. Please keep focused on helping, building, and living righteously.
