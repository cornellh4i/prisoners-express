**"In Cancers, We Trust" by RJ Clayton**

Have you ever wondered why Congress didn’t file a lawsuit against the tobacco companies for causing cancer? If you didn’t know, believe it. For it is very true. Honestly. They only filed against them for lying to Congress. That’s it. Nothing more. Because hey, after all, lying at a congressional hearing is a far greater trespass than murdering people.

In their defense, tobacco companies don’t give you cancer. No, that would not be right. They, in fact, sell it to you. This, in my mind, is the greatest of byproducts brought down to us by capitalism. That’s right. Let freedom ring! All, in the land of, we the people. Where we can sell you anything we wish, so long as it makes you suffer. The easiest thing for a person to prophecy in today’s age is the downfall of America. Not only that, but the fact that we will destroy ourselves. You see, kids will always seek to rebel. And the only way to do that is to do that which is risky or harmful. Like blowing smoke in an authoritarian face.

All tobacco companies themselves did a naughty thing, lying to Congress. Yes, they need their hand spanked. But lobbyists from thousands of companies kept them from judging on the cancerous aspects of the issues. Why? Because millions of products cause cancer. Just like the meat of shrimp, crab, lobster, catfish, and pigs are cancer. But they don’t call pig “pig” on labels. No, that’s yellow #5. Anyway, these animals clean our planet naturally by taking the bad things in unto themselves. When you eat them though, it becomes part of your chemical make up. Just as the most common cancerous byproduct: saccharin.

Saccharin is a sugar substitute that is used in abundance in many of your household products. Things like toothpaste, Kool-Aid, Jello, pudding, and artificial sweeteners contain within them some type of sweetener with saccharin. And every time you use products such as the former, and bathing products, you increase your chances of getting cancer. Even by eating ready made meals and some potato chips.

Due to the fact that most household products are shared, you are, because of this, purchasing cancer for your loved ones as well. Especially those of them that are children because they are still forming and due to this, much more susceptible to disease. And now that vaccinations aren’t working--due to them using eggs as their base and not plankton--its growth within them is more rapid.

On top of all of this, they are smoking. Destroying their feeble, still forming lungs. All the while knowing the end result of it. I myself did it. Even after watching my own grandmother suffer and die from emphysema. And, they have access to similar knowledge. But even more so, they have access to nicotine.

E-cigarettes are the worst possible things that could be allowed at markets. This becomes even more true if it is unregulated. Not only by making liquid cancerous substances easier to acquire, but due to the fact it will make other drugs easier to hide. Do you actually believe that a kid cannot come up with a way to make a cocktail to smoke? If a politician can legalize THC oil, you best believe a teenager can manufacture it.

In Texas this year, marijuana oil was legalized for children’s use. Now you take that, put it in your E-cigarette, and get high with all of your kids. Oh, and just mix it with incense and liquid tobacco, and you can use it anywhere. And if that’s not potent enough for you, add a little sherm. That’s right. Zooda-bang that mix. Hey, for the club, liquify some Molly or speed, or heroin and H-base ecstasy. Be sure to chase it with an energy drink though. We need to be sure we’re hospitalized at the end of the day.

Hospitals and comeback medications are the number one and two leading industries in our entire world. This has been true year after year, especially during the Recession. For this reason, the powers that be will never outlaw cancer-causing substances. Just like they’ll never find a true cure for anything anymore. I mean, look at the product Belsomra. All it does is help you get a good night sleep. But it can give you suicidal tendencies. Do you really need a night’s sleep so bad that you’ll risk waking up in the morning to kill yourself? Even still, killing ourselves in groups is exactly what our so-called betters want. Only, the governments want to tax these deaths, and corporations want us to pay them outright for it. Do you believe it? You should. Because you can get wind of it from all of their back alley deals. Foreigners own us; they always have. Just ask Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If not, take me at my word now, and you might live to see it manifest because your eyes. It’s either that, or to submit to the will of those that are no longer allowed to love.

Your children are your very own. It’s a very simple and innate principle that you should want what’s best for them. But even you can’t, with all your heart, soul and might, save them from the circumstances of the day. You can, however, teach them the best you can. And also, check every single label very carefully. Even calling the company or FDA if you have to. This will show your kids and their friends you care. It will make it far more than just a conservation in passing moments. Don’t do it. And your child will be the next one going out to smoke a few with a couple of his friends.
