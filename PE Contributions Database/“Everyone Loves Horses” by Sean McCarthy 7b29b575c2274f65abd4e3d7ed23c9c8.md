**“Everyone Loves Horses” by Sean McCarthy**

****Another cold, damp night in Northern California. It was my last surgery that took us on the journey to the middle of nowhere. Our 1989 GMC baby blue van, Blue Goose, loaded with nine other juvenile delinquents and two group home counselors, was the only noise slicing through the silence of our dead night.

Chance House Group for young boys, some troublemakers and some troubled, is located in Chico. For the past year the drive to UC Davis Hospital, in Sacramento, took over the majority of my life during my crucial, do-or-die, senior year. The group home always tagged along.

This was going to be my twelfth surgery in eighteen years; I vowed to make it my last. After repairing the cleft lip and cleft palate several times, along with many “minor” procedures (I still have no idea why the doctors call them minor), the rest, including this one, were purely cosmetic. This particular one was the realigning my top jaw and required me to wear a Halo, which was bolted to my skull a quarter inch deep, six times. They called it a bone graft. Very painful to say the least; vicodin helped a little. The reasons I vowed to avoid future surgeries: the excruciating pain and addictive pills.

Months of preparations: I was ready, the doctors were ready and, well, the group home not so much. The night before a counselor and I drive down to the hotel, right across the street from the hospital. Being a native of Sacramento, I decided to walk the couple of miles to my sister’s home, if only to say “Hi” and to calm my nerves. She was a great aid to suppress my anxiety.

“Successful!” I hear a doctor say hours later as my consciousness tries to find a way out of the grogginess. My entire upper torso was stiff and numb. For several days many doctors come to examine me, but then one day they don’t. Two weeks after the surgery, finally, my young pretty nurse asked me “who’s supposed to come and take you home?” I tell her, “my group home.” She then begins to call and call and call. Around 9:00 PM she reaches someone and informs them that they should have been there to pick me up a week ago. They filled the van and began their trek.

It was close to midnight when I was wheeled out and loaded into the Blue Goose. They, for some reason, packed the van to the brim with rowdy kids. Not cool! The driver was unfamiliar with the outskirts that lead away from the highway. Running pretty late he decides to take a “shortcut” off of the safe highway toward the pitch black nowhere. Low and behold we get lost and there is nothing out there, including no cell phone reception.

It’s freezing cold in the back of the old van, and then suddenly we become engulfed in a blanket of dense fog, forcing the imagination to think it’s colder. Life sucked for me at this moment. The boys are jumping and screaming, having fun, and we are lost. A glow from a distance luminates our destination for help. Driving carefully to stay on the invisible road, our driver navigates us to the promised land. Everyone, including me, shouts for joy upon arrival to the factory of some sort. It being late nobody was expected to be there, but somewhere on the grounds should be a phone.

Erin, the vegetarian counselor, courageously took the challenge to seek out the phone on foot as we continued to drive the van around. Simultaneously, her on foot, us on Blue Goose, we converge on an open door to one of the warehouses. Our headlights help guide Erin to the inside. Her trip is short lived, as seconds later she’s seen running back to the van screaming. She’s blubbering so bad we can’t understand her. “Horses! Horses! They’re all dead!” the repeated words she cried out. The driver gets out to further investigate the tragic ordeal.

More composed, but still a bit shocked, he returns. He begins to tell us, while vegetarian Erin is still in tears, that we found a horse meat factor, and inside the warehouse tables are full of all sorts of horse body parts. Conveniently, the heads were placed right near the entrance, all looking at the intruders who dared. They selfishly refused to allow us boys to venture out to see the horror they got to witness. The rest of the way in the deep fog; finally, hours later we emerge out of it to find our home.
