**Helping Hand by Jason Stallup**

Sometimes you just take notice of someone. Something catches your attention, your eye, piques your interest. “Oscar” I’ll call him as I’ve long ago forgotten his name, was a young guy about my own age, mid-20’s or so, average height and weight, short dark hair, just another guy on a packed Greyhound bus rolling down a snow-covered highway. My mind was heavy with worry and anxiety. I had a lot to consider and my fellow passengers weren’t a priority. But as we crept deeper into the middle of the country the bus thinned out to the point many of us had our own seats. I had already took notice of Oscar by then just as anyone would look over those who rode along with them. Mind working through my anxiety by distraction. You see, always on the run having just escaped from a psych evaluation, from a county jail having sent me to a state hospital. Having warrants in a couple other states, always a wanted man, (all of which has been resolved, and years gone by) with a few hundred one dollar bills all managed to amass before I got away, nothing else to my name, Oscar, as usual, stood off, alone, to one side during a stop to eat. He always stood off by himself whenever we had stopped for refreshments and to stretch our legs, never even going inside whatever store or fast food joint we happened to be at. This time I listened to that little inner voice and all bent over to introduce myself.

“Man… I would appreciate that, yes” Oscar had replied when I had asked, with a jerk of my thumb toward the brightly-lit, warm restaurant, if he would care to have a meal.

“On me,” I added. It was an interesting story I heard that day as we sat at a table and had burgers and fries. Oscar was on his way to upstate New York where he was to spend the next five years at a monastery. Without a penny in his pocket he was crossing the country… to one day, perhaps, be a monk.

Over the years I have sometimes wondered how Oscar fared, curious to know if he make it through the five years and whatever path his life followed. I’ve wondered, too, if I should’ve shared my story with him as he shared his with me. For several reasons I wouldn’t have, mainly because of the shame of where I knew my path was going. It’s the way it is I think at least for many of us, to be shameful of our station in life, or of the wrong path we are on, when with someone who is walking a good, honest path… with a good, honest future ahead of them! One thing I am sure of though, is that “Oscar” remembers the friendly stranger who bought him a meal. Just as I remember those who have fed me during times of hunger as well.. At least the act if not the person.

Karma exists. In my case that circle came around, a couple times… We should all help others as often as we can, even in the smallest ways...
