**“Impossible” by Delvin Diles**

I was a naive and neurotic teenager. Twenty years ago, I killed a man in cold blood, left his convulsing body in a field miles from his home, confessed to the crime and tearfully apologized to his family in a courtroom. I felt like it was the right thing to do. Didn’t strike me until years later how absurd the notion was.

You borrow a magazine and accidentally tear a page, and you say, “Damn man. I tore page 58… What do I owe you?” Drop your celly’s hot pot and crack it? “My bad celly! I’ll get you another one ASAP.” But shoot a kid’s older cousin/brother in the head 3 times? All you see in his eyes through your tear-stained apologies from across the courtroom is a vacancy that is impossible to fill. Still he nods at you, acknowledging your attempt.

Or is he saying to himself, “You should be sorry, asshole!! I hope you get gang-raped daily!!” Maybe in his own naivete, he just feels like it’s the right thing to do in an impossible situation.
