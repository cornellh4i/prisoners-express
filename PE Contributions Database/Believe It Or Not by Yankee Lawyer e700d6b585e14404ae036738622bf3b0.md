Believe It Or Not by Yankee Lawyer

We all believe what we want to. At least some of our beliefs are based upon convenience, not facts. Nevertheless, the truth endures unchanged, whether we believe it or not.

Americans today are confused and discouraged. This is the world’s leading carceral nation. There are two possible explanations. Thousands of criminals are incarcerated because of the evil things they did as members of a wicked population; or thousands of victims are incarcerated because of evil things members of the ruling class did. Neither of these is acceptable to us. The world knows the truth. We reject it. I am a political prisoner. Our constitution does not authorize anyone to take political prisoners, but shit happens, believe it or not.

I told the truth. I revealed facts that powerful people wanted suppressed. The cops at times said “Why don’t you go home? I explained that the Constitution says, inter alia, that I was home and didn’t have to go anywhere. At other times, they asked me to go to the police station and I refused. I often defied the police, not because of my lawlessness, but because of theirs.

The U.S.A is the only developed nation state in the world that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Apparently, a U.N. treaty guranteeing equal protection and due process rights to minors in unacceptable to the ruling class in the world’s leading producer and consumer of child pornography. No withstanding North Carolina’s position in the so called Bible Belt, its rulers have a lot to lose, believe it or not.

The Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina is a major center of human trafficking. I opposed it. I’m paying a heavy price.

Pedophiles tried to kill me. When that didn’t work, they locked me up. I will probably die in prison if God doesn’t intervene. These facts may be inconvenient, but the truth will endure unchanged, whether people believe it or not.
