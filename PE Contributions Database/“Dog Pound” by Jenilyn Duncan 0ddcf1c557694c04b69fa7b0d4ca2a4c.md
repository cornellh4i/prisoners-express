**“Dog Pound” by Jenilyn Duncan**

This has all the love. He gives love back, too. He’s happy with the life he has. He’d do anything for them. He is loyal. It looks like he is sitting in the lap of luxury, feeling content with his surroundings. They admire him. He was trained to be obedient to commands. He also loves playing fetch.
