Arrivederci Alis Volat Propriis (translation: Till we meet again, She flies with her own wings)

Lisa: Short Haircut

Jennifer: Curly/Frizzy Mane

Lisa: When was the last time a man really made love to you, who was it and how did it made you feel?

Jennifer: Damn girl, let me brace myself on this wall because hearing you ask that question, thinking back, the feeling of Nirvana just hit me all over again. Hold on, let me take a couple more pulls off this cigarette before my heart and body start yearning. It was about 16-17 years ago and it was with that handsome African prince, Teddy.

Lisa: I knew you were going to him…

Jennifer: LET. ME. FINISH. BEFORE. YOU. INTERRUPT!

(Lisa giggles and smiles)

Jennifer: We had went out to that Ethiopian Restaurant on the East Side on Liberia Way, had a delicious meal (very spicy, you know I love spicy). Afterwards we took a stroll through Kenya Park. Came out around the corner from Teddy’s home on Kemet Ave. We proceeded inside and giiirrrrrlll I just lost ALLLLL control when we crossed the threshold. He responded to my advances, wandering hands by entwining his hands with mine and kissing me so strongly but gently as he walked me towards the back of the home, his lips still on mine as we breathe as one. As we entered his room which was decorated in gold, red, black and green, he softly laid me down (Jennifer starts shivering as she recalls the memories) and for my very first time ever he gave me the most sensual full body massage with Coconut Carrot Oil (Hot). The O’s proceeded from that moment until Teddy finished making BEAUTIFUL, ELECTRIFYING, SWEET, STRONG, TENDER love to me 4 hours later. Even after we were done, I had to rest for several hours due to the continuous tingling of my body. WHOOOH!! That’s what you call making love. Everytime I think about it, I feel like I’M ON TOP OF THE WOORLD!!!

THE END
