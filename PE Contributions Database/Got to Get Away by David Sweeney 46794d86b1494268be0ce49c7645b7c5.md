**"Got to Get Away" by David Sweeney**

The train was traveling east at a rather slow speed. The three teens sat and waited for the engine cars to pass. As they were hiding in the woods off the track, trying not to be seen by the train personnel or the gang of hoodlums that were chasing them. Jimmy, John and Jack braced themselves and got ready to sprint for the train car. Just as they started running and closing in on the train car, the train started to pick up speed--Jimmy made it to the car and grabbed on. As he was hoisting himself up, John was there climbing on.

The hoodlums rushed out of the woods with their guns drawn and started firing at the teen. Jack had to zigzag and almost fell as he tripped over a rock. Jack just made it to the ladder and was hoisted up by both Jimmy and John. The three fell in the car breathless but safe.

The chase wasn’t over since the gang of hoodlums was slowly catching up to the ladder. Frantic and scared, the teens searched desperately for something to defend themselves with. Jimmy found a three foot piece of pipe, John found a couple big rocks that could be thrown from a deep dark corner, and Jack found an old, beat up piece of wood that has seen better days.

The gang of hoodlums wanted these three real bad because they walked up on the gang and witnessed them rape and murder an innocent girl whose only crime was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

As the gang was getting closer to the ladder, John started launching the big rocks that he found at the gang. John caught the ladder right in the face, making him stumble and fall. Jimmy leaned out the door and hit the next man in the back of the head as hard as he could. That knocked the man out cold and left him laying in the rocks as the train kept on speeding away. Jack came up and hit the next man in the head with the board but didn’t do any damage. The board broke and crumbled away, leaving him with nothing but a foot long piece. John ran up beside Jack, threw his last rock at the man, and clipped him in the shoulder, throwing him off balance and making him fall. The last two hoodlums pulled their guns out of their waistbands and open fired on the three teens. Jack chucked his little piece of wood at one of the hoods and hit him in the hand, making him drop his gun. The last hoodlums, seeing that he was alone and almost out of breath, gave up his chase and went back to help his other friends.

Jimmy, John and Jack jumped off the train when it slowed down and head toward the police station where they told the captain their story.
