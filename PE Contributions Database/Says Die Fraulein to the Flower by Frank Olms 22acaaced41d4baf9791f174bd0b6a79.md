**Says Die Fraulein to the Flower by Frank Olms**

The fraulein was staring at the flower, her eyes absorbing all the color and fluff and filigree that the Great Creator had bestowed upon the lowly plant-- the lowly plant that was anchored to the ground by its multitasking system of roots. Contemplating the similarities and differences between herself and the lovely flower, she bowed down to the flower and whispered saying:

“Color, finesse, and filigree,

The great God has given thee,

But beauty, form, and mobility,

He has given to me.”

The flower summoned the wings of the wind,

And leaned into her face.

They stared at each other for quite a while,

Then the flower said with grace:

“You may have form and mobility

While I’m fixed on a slender stalk,

But I have no place I wish to go,

So I have no need to walk.”

The fraulein listened intently

To the flower’s argument,

And thought about where the flowers go:...

Only where they’re sent.

The fraulein told the flower,

“I’m going to the fair,

And if you’d like to join me,

You can ride upon my hair.”

The flower gazed upon the stream

Of flowers round her head,

And wondered how nice it would be

To sit up there instead.

The flower ask of the fair,

What would the flower see?

The fraulein told of all the sights,

“Plus you will be with me.”

“That all sounds nice, but how can I get up upon you head,

For my roots go down deep in the earth--

The earth which is my bed.”

The fraulein thought and then she said,

“I can cut your slender stem

Then place you in the garland stream

And then you’ll be with them.”

The flower thought of all the sights,

But with her stem cut she would die

When the flower said no to the offer,

She left with a sigh.
