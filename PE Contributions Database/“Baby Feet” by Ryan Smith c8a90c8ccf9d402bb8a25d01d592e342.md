**“Baby Feet” by Ryan Smith**

“He’s got the whole world in his hands. He’s got the whole world, in his hands. He’s got the whole world in his hands. He’s got the whole world in his hands. He’s got the whole. World. In. His. Hands.”

I learned that song at a very young age, close to the time when I began getting victimized by a babysitter. Either that song is a lie or God is evil. There is so much pain, sadness, anger, and injustice in the world; if it is truly “in his hands,” he would do well to make it better.

“ He’s got the whole world in his hands..”

A few years later my world crumbled when I was stolen away from what semblance of a family I was part of, and placed in a lockdown facility surrounded by barren desert. I stayed in group homes for seven years through no fault of my own.

“ He’s got the whole world in his hands...”

When I became old enough to have a family of my own, I made that a top priority. I tried very hard, and beat the odds to stay out of prison long enough to get married and to make a career out of working on houses. My mettle was tested when the housing market crashed in 208, but I had the tenacity to endure the recession while on felony probation, and kept a roof over our heads. All I have ever wanted was to be part of a happy family. I poured all of my heart and energy into making it happen. To my chagrin, my wife was cursed with endometriosis. It was easier and more cost-effective to obtain opiates from the neighbor than a doctor. Her condition went undiagnosed and untreated until the removal of her ovaries became requisite.

“ He’s got the whole world in his hands...”

I cannot express to you the depth of my desire with which I cling to, for teaching that song to my little girl or boy. I would love to teach my kids any number of things. Unfortunately I do not think that will be a possibility anytime in the foreseeable future. I am spending my thirties in prison. More likely than not, the progeny of my meth-induced revelries will be out in the world growing up, unbeknownst to me.

“ He’s got the whole world in his hands…”

I would love to partake in the American dream. Many people believe that’s a house and the proverbial white picket fence. The truth is, those things are secondary to the sound of children laughing in the yard. That’s where my pursuit of happiness would lead if the world really was “in his hands.” The moral of this story is this: That song is a farce. Also, so are you if you knowingly have children and it is within your power to be a parent, yet you choose not to be. You don’t have to be a *GOOD* parent, just as long as you are there. Our society needs more parents. More importantly, to every man or woman who is raising a child that is not of their own seed, you are deserving of the highest respect. Kudos.
