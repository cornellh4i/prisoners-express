**“Burdens Carried” by Carl Branson**

This warrior-hero practices Father Flanagan’s Boystown motto: he ain’t heavy; he’s my burden. Unfortunately, the burdens most of us carry are neither heroic nor readily visible to those around us. The burdens we carry are most commonly confined to the boundaries of our own mind. They include the full range of “what if’s,” together with those personal, emotional responses that transcend even the best therapist. All too frequently the “what if’s” and emotional responses are commingled.

Many of these burdens are common to most, if not all, of us. A prime example is separation from a high school sweetheart. Here, the “what if’s” and emotional responses are joined at the hip. Regardless of who terminated the relationship, there is always a tender corner of the heart that yearns for the joys and good times remembered. Of course, the rational part of the mind kicks in to analyze the “what if’s” in the relationship and subsequent life experiences. Prime among these contemplations is: would our joy and good times have lasted the life time we hoped for while dating? An alternative would be: what would it be like if we got back together now?

Then there is the phenomenon which is more common than we are willing to acknowledge: the loss of a soulmate spouse at far too young of an age, be it from the ravages of cancer an unexpected accident, or any one of a myriad of causes. Certainly, given enough time, that hollow sense of loss and grief can be walled off so that life can go on, but that wall has chinks through which unwanted, depressing emotional responses can, and will, seep from time to time. No matter how hard we try to seal them off, the rational mind and all of its “what if’s” are worthless because the cause of death is always beyond the our ability to control or change circumstances.

Other examples of the burdens we bear on a daily basis could probably fill a library’s worth of books. I think you get the idea.

Yes, the pictured warrior deserves our respect and admiration for his selfless dedication to his wounded companion. But don’t forget to bestow that same respect and admiration on daily reflection in the mirror--and to every other face seen throughout the day who is also carrying invisible burdens.
