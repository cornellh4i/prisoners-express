**"The Woman in Black Tattoo" by Red Dot**

Navy SEAL Tod Sea was overseas fighting the terrorists when he slipped on a mountain ledge and hit his head. Tod woke up panicked and said, “Where am I?” A lady in all black with her face covered said, “I’m not a terrorist. You fell off that mountain. You’ve been asleep for three days.” “Do you got my equipment?” “Yes, everything you had is in that corner.” As a headache rushed through his head, she sat next to him and held his head. She said, “You are OK. You just bumped your head. A few days’ rests then you’re good to go.” She went to the stove, put on some soup, and told him to eat. As Tod ate the soup, it burned his throat and stomach. As Tod sat there, he looked at the Lady in Black and asked, “Why did you help me?” “Tod, It’s my way of life. I’m Muslim.” “I got to get back to my team. Thank you. You saved me. I’m going to call tomorrow. Tell them to come to pick me up. I’m going to get some sleep. I feel really tired, and Tod fell out asleep, snoring. The Lady in Black just looked at him and did a good blessing. Tod woke up sore and went to his equipment and radioed his SEAL team: “SEAL team 2, This is Tod. I’m OK. Come get me.” Tod got dressed, looked at the woman, and asked, “Can I give you a hug?” She said yes, and so Tod hugged her and said, “Thank you. You saved my life.” Then the team that has been searching showed up at the door, and they knocked. The Woman in Black opened the door, and the team came in. Tod explained that the woman saved his life, and the team thanked her. They got back to the base. Tod decided to get a tattoo of the Woman in Black so the next weekend Tod went to the tattoo shop and got a woman over his heart. Thank you, Woman, in Black.
