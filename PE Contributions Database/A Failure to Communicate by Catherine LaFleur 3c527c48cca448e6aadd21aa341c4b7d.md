**“A Failure to Communicate” by Catherine LaFleur**

****I’ve worked at the Law Library for a number of years. I do case work but the majority of my time is taken up by working the Special Housing Unit and answering request forms. The request forms are the most difficult because not only do I have to figure out hundreds of handwriting styles, I also have to interpret the actual request. Most people can’t spell or write coherently. Many times I have to guess at what they want. A few times I have fantasized about making an appropriate response. Some of the requests are beyond hilarious. Here are a few for your reading pleasure.

Legal requests:

I would like to see the nude Florida statutes. (Translation: I want to see the new Florida statutes.)

I would like a notarized loaf. (Translation: I would like a notarized oath.)

Or I would like a notarized oaf. (Translation: same.)

And…I would like an unauthorized oath.

Can you please look at my illegal paperwork? (*No, only the legal documents*.)

I would like to file a past life conviction. (Translation: post conviction relief.)

I need research time. (Translation: research time?)

I would like to file with CERN. (I can only assume they want a post conviction? Not to talk to scientists about the Large Hadron Collider.)

I was not stadle to stand testfive. (*I agree, you obviously weren’t*.)

May I file a mystery motion? (No translation available. *No you have to be specific for the court.*)

Will the court accept an expert medium to allow the deceased victims to testify? (*I’m not kidding.*)

Unanswerable questions:

How many individual M&M’s am I allowed to possess? (*Only the magic 8 ball knows.*)

How long will it take for the judge to answer my motion? (*See previous response.*)

Will my motion be granted? (*Same.*)

I want to join Bridge Burners. (Bridge Burners is a year long 12-step class, but I think you’ve probably burned enough bridges on your own.)

Medical questions and misspellings to make you shudder:

I have multiple breasts and have been denied a mammogram. Can you help?

Would you please look into my regions? (*A generous offer, but no, thank you.*)

I need help with my breastesses.

I had a hysterectomy that is not right. (*Definitely not right!*)

As you can see I have my work cut out for me. Such is the glamorous life of a law clerk. I hope you are as easily amused by this as I am.
