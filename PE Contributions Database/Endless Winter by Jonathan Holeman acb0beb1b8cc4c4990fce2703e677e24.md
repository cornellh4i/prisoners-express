***Endless Winter* by Jonathan Holeman**

When I was a child, I could still laugh. Not just a passing guffaw at a ridiculous joke on a sitcom. Not just a little chuckle at a comical cat video on the ellen show. When I was a child, I knew the hilarious rejoicing uproar of amusing merriment in laughter. I could shout in joy and mirth and giggle at cartoons.

That laughter faded away and died like a rainbow breaking arches of color across the sky, and falling as the sun shines, or, as in my case, the cloud cover became so grey, drab, and dark that no color, no laughter could show through again. Yet, every now and then, I might think, these clouds will dissipate, and a little ray of chortle, a beam of snortling cackles will break through, to only be covered by the black and wintery clouds again.

The bleak blandness of colorless lands holds this cold bewitching beauty, a droplet of silence. Flakes marking each and every day float down upon a freezing block of ice that swallows us into glaciers drifting on oceans of loneliness.

Sighing under a bed of starlight deep in the night. Eyes closed to the hum of the ventilation system. I can still sense the beauty of nature deep in the days of innocence. When I was a child, I could still laugh. I had a full smile, a life, a hope, and happiness. Now the smile seems crooked, and laughs are sinuous, for all the wrong reasons.

Is this what it is to be a man? No laughter. No joy. No shout in triumph at an accomplishment wrought by my own hands. No more wonder. Thoughts always wander. A tittering twist on a windy pathway leading down, deep down to a pit of everlasting despair. Coldness, frozen heart, block of stone covering walls, fortifications guarding the past. The past, where there was a sun, warmth, and the scents of fresh cut grass and lilac trees swaying in the breeze. As birds awoke, gentle whistling whispers. The buzz of bees pollinating. Planes roaming way up in the blue flying along puffs of marshmallows. Living in this endless winter, alive only in visions of things that never occurred. Oh, how many lives I’d have lived in a different way. So, so very few, the remembrances of moments that went well, or that I wouldn’t change if I could. Brief respites, hidden, secret, wholesome memories of long forgotten days of lore.

Drowned in the icy abyss of dark cool tossing waves below a never ending depth of drenching salty freezing tears. Horror threatens, swimming near, out of translucent shadow shades of seam pushing along a current, snapping jaws of rows of razor teeth, cutting, puncturing the flesh of spirit, bleeding out strands of odious contempt. Drowned beneath the surface of ever tossing, turning undertows of brilliant crashing waves.

Then something deep and dark in late, late night, a vision, a dream, a memory returns of the wide eyed full and crushing uproarious laughter of my own little child. She would shout in gleeful chuckles, scream in joyful giggles, and I hope she may never lose her smile. As we grow, we might forget our own lone laughter while that of others brings a sigh. Perhaps only a child knows true laughter, but in a crooked old wrinkled and withered smile, there’s something only age can teach us to laugh about.
