****Most of the time a person’s nickname tells a lot about them, their character, temperament, habits, and/or mindset. As a young child, my mom gave me the first nickname I would be known by as a term of endearment. She’d yell, “Man!” and I’d know she was only referring to me, and so I’d respond. Being her youngest child and only boy, it’s pretty apparent why this became the name my family calls me.

The second nickname or handle I became known by was Lil Love Child. I was given this title by a neighbor named Samantha who was a beautiful, voluptuous vixen at age 23 when I was 13. She was a professional prostitute who herself went by the handle “Heaven.” Because she called me that, everyone else did too. I lost my virginity to her, and she gave me $700 and told me, “Only fools fuck for me, so if you get laid, get paid.”

Later that year, I joined a gang, and they thought Lil Love Child was too soft a handle, so I received my gang name “Assassin.” They told me it fit my personality due to how quiet I was, how I could get close to anyone without their noticing, and how strategic my actions and thinking worked against all opposition. At that point, I responded to all my nicknames.

It wasn’t until many years later that once again I would be renamed and rebranded. Two prostitutes who invented my pimping name and persona were Cotton and Delicious, and they named me both Sir Mack Raymond and AB$OLUTE. They explained to me that they were both from the Harlem area and were members of the Five Percenters Nation of God and Earth. They told me that I was God, and that is why they gave me the name AB$OLUTE. The second name was to be used for outside of our intimate circle because it meant So I’m Respected (SIR) Master At Communicating Knowledge (MACK). Then the name my mother gave me upon physical birth (Raymond). I would be AB$OLUTE only to Earths (women) whose magnetism or attraction lead them to follow my intelligence or light as the planets in this universe orbits the sun.

Later, I received the true teachings of the 5%ers called the 120 Lessons, at which point I became a registered member known as Poor Righteous Teacher and received the name I am known by all civilized peoples (Master Knowledge Born God). My fellow prisoners call me Knowledge, my righteous nickname.
