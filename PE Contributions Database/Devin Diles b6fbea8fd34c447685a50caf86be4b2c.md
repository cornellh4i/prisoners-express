At my first job, I was a grill cook at a Sonic’s Drive-In fast-food restaurant in Oakcliff, a low-income area in Dallas, Texas. I was 15. It was during summer, so all I could think about was how I’d have my own school clothes budget, finally. Guess I thought the minimum-wage check was gonna have me just supa-fly on the first day of school.

The staff was young and all-black, but our manager was real country. Daniel was black, but cowboy hatted, boots, jeans and hick-drawled up. Which woulda been spiteful, save the fact that enlarged eyes behind coke-bottom lenses made him funny at a glance. Permanently funny. Especially when he gets excited. Which was what happened whenever he talked lewdly about women, sex, womanizing, or his barnyard mack methods. “I tol’ her. ‘Mmmmmmm...look good...smell good...wonder how it taste!” That’s just one of his many one-liners, all the more hilarious because he sincerely seemed to believe in their effect on women. For all I knew thought, maybe a rumor goi’n around about him and Tony in the walk-in freezer. But who’s to say how true that shit was. Why would Tony, young and pretty as hell, want with ol’ corny, country-ass Daniel? She had a boyfriend closer to her age that picked her up from work every day. Plus I knew she was too analytical to fall for barnyard mackology. In the stockroom one day, I was ripping the lids off some cardboard boxes of containers she needed. I gripped the end of a lid and just before I yanked it, she placed her hand softly on mine, locked eye contact and stated through a pensive squint, “You got hands like you been workin all yo’ life.” Instant palpitation and shock funnelled some bumbling about having done a lotta yard work as a kid.

My lameness at Sonic’s didn’t keep ShaTonga from pursuing me. Especially after Daniel told her--without my knowledge--that I was a virgin. Which wasn’t true, but the day she came to my house as I babysat my sister and cousins in her daisy dukes and halter top, thinking she was about to be my first, she was on a mission. Astride, she was demonic, rhythmic, astounding. Of course she outdid me; I was in shock the whole time.

She quit shortly after that, and Daniel asked about her. I told him she’d moved on, and he bucked his eyes and shouted a question in my face, “Dontcha know what you do when you git a gurl that cut fer ya like dat?!” “What?” I asked him. He yelled his reply, “YOU GIT HER TO SUCK YER DICK, MAN!”

All these life lessons--grilling, deep-frying, communication skills--came to me rapidly right up to the day I laid the cash from my first check on my bed to show Mama, proudly. Beaming, she exclaimed, “That’s just enough for the rent!” Handing me a ten over from the $300 dollars she snatched up in a blink, she concluded, “Welcome to the real world, son.”
