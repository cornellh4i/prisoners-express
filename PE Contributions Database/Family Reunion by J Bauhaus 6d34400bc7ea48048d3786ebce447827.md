**"Family Reunion" by J. Bauhaus**

I don’t remember much about family reunions. It’s just been too long. A lot of them, when I was very young, are memorable in that my dad and his brother would wind up asleep, after a big meal, in front of the television, watching football.

The food was always really good; usually turkey, some kind of pie, pumpkin or chocolate, sometimes both. Unless it was Independence Day, Memorial Day, or Labor Day: then the food was potato salad and dogs. Much like the gut meat that we are forced to eat in all these prisons, except much higher quality. Prison dogs are not Ball-Park Franks, and they are certainly not made by Oscar Meyer or Hebrew National.

Speaking of gut meals we see every meal in prison. There have been 800 studies made, some of those lasting 20 years that tell us how poisonous processed scrap meats are (bologna, sausage, bacon, dogs and patties). I read that the World Health Organization combined all these studies and found that “Eating 1.7 ounces of processed meat per day increases your risk of dying of colon cancer by 18% per year.” Now, we must realize that this finding represents a very low risk compared to the real risk, because, like the tobacco industry before it, the scrap meat industry counteract each scientific study with an industry study.

Prison gut meats are even more poisonous than the scrap meats that the industry is permitted to sell to free people because anything goes with prison food. Prison scrap meats are made for prisoners, only by people who hate us on a general, stereotyped basis. So, anything can happen to our food before it gets here. Then, it is handed by guards who hate us and then prepared by inmates who are both very careless, indifferent and ignorant. Often they are malicious and stupid. Almost always, they cut corners on your chow while scheming on how to make more, better chow for themselves.

Even worse is that inmates eat way more than 1.7 ounces of scrap meat per day. “We” (not me) eat about 3 times this amount, every day, so our risk of cancer developing anywhere along our 25 feet of digestion tube is at least 3 times greater than stated above. And, a lot of inmates are bologna hogs. They steal, beg or buy as much of it as they can get and gobble it down as quickly as they can. You can tell these people by their big, basketball-size bellies pooching out in front of them like the prow of a ship. They eat “Tums” by the handful and pile stuff up under the front of their jail pads, so it raises their lungs up above their mountain of belly. This is so that big sack of fat won’t smother them, which it would if they lay down flat and level.

Over the years of stuffing their guts, cancer slowly builds. Between 5 and 20 years of scarfing scrap meats, their guts get to hurting so badly that they have to go get a foot or so of diseased intestine chopped out. Then cancer gets worse in other parts of their guts. The doctors never tell them the truth (“you’re going to die before two years ago by”), because they want their doomed patients to have a false sense of hope, in the form of a “positive attitude.” They have been taught that a positive attitude makes their patients live longer. I know that a positive attitude lets them think that “one more dagwood sandwich can’t hurt.”

Every major prison has a dark, secluded set of cages full of these not quite yet dead men watching TV, with shit up their backs, waiting to die. The prison rats keep this situation very quiet because they know that it is the direct result of the poisonous prison diet. They know that alimentary canal cancer deaths in prison are many times higher than the rate found among free people who can choose to eat non-poisonous food or less poisonous food. This guilty knowledge makes them fear that they may get caught holding the malpractice bag when this story breaks. When a captive dies, nobody cares. He died as soon as the gate slammed shut behind him if he was stuck here long enough to catch colon cancer. Your family slowly backs away, waving and smiling farther and farther. Then, when you can barely still see them, they turn around and go. You don’t even realize it, because the process is so gradual. You die slowly in prison. They go have their holiday reunions. Your name never comes up, you’re totally forgotten. You can’t even remember any family reunion.
