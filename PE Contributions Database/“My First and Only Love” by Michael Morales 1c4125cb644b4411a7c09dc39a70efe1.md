**“My First and Only Love” by Michael Morales**

It was September 2007, and I just got out of T.D.C.J. after doing a three year sentence. I was 25 years old and never really had a girl, a woman, or whatever you want to call it. I was pretty much locked up all my life, and when I wasn’t locked up, I wasn’t really worried about a woman: I was worried about getting high. While in prison, my grandma told me she would love to see me get out and find a good woman, have kids, and start a family. I always thought about it but never thought anybody would want to start a family with me.

I’m not a bad looking guy. I have all my teeth, and all my hair. I’m not fat. I have a smooth baby face. My only problem was, I did drugs. Anyway, I got out of prison and I was on a mission to find a woman, but not just any woman, a good one. I don’t believe in one night stands. I don’t sleep with a woman on the first day. If a woman has sex with a man she knows nothing about, she’s a hoe, a whore, a slut… in my opinion. I could never see myself having sex with a woman I don’t know well.

My uncle George called me up and asked, “Whatcha doing? You wanna go out?” I told him, “Alright.” So he came to pick me up, and we go into this little hole in the wall bar. It was empty besides two men at the bar drinking, an old lady and a young woman and this man at the pool table drinking. I don’t drink! I mean, I have before, but I don’t do it a lot.

So I was just chilling, and my uncle tells me, “Chris, I bet you $100 you can’t get a phone number from a girl tonight.” He put the $100 bill on the bar and said, “If you can’t this is going to the bartender.” He was just trying to impress the sexy bartender with the big titties. So I told him, “bet.” The bartender said, “Honey, I’ll give you my phone number, and we can split the money.”

I said, “Nah, I’ll get a number. Watch and see.” There was only one woman around my age inside the bar playing pool or really just sitting there. So I see the old lady and young woman enter the restroom, and the young woman exits first. I tell the bartender, “What kind of beer is that girl drinking?” She said, “Bud Light.” So I replied, “Give me a bucket of Bud Light and two dollars in quarters.” So she does it.

I’d never in my life approached a woman in a bar or any other place for that matter. I was green! I didn’t have a clue what I was going to say or do. I was nervous, but I told myself, “I got this.” So I walked over to this girl and said, “Excuse me, would you like to play a game of pool with me and have a drink?” She just looks up at me and doesn’t say anything. The guy next to her is silent too. I said “ummm okay” and just stood there, and right when I was fixing to turn around and leave, the older lady comes out of the restroom and says “Hey, what’s up? Who are you?” I told her, “I’m Chris. I was just asking this young lady if she wanted to play some pool.” She replied, “Oh that’s my daughter. She’s not your type, but I’ll play with you.” So I said, “Okay, here goes some beer, I bought it for you.”

I grabbed one and took a sip, trying to look cool. So I put some quarters in the pool table and start racking the balls, and this lady starts asking me 21 questions. I didn’t lie to her, I told her the truth, “I just got out of prison. I got no kids. I got a job. And I’m looking for a woman.” She asked me if I cared about other girls with kids, and if I would hook up with a girl with kids. And I replied “Yeah, I ain’t tripping.” Well I was looking towards the bar and I already knew they were making fun of me for playing pool with this older lady. Anyway, the lady tells me about her other daughter Gloria, and I was like, “Where is she?” and she replied, “At home,” so I didn’t think too much about it, and I just said “Well, nice meeting you,” and went back to the bar.

The first thing they asked me was, “Did you get that old lady’s number?” And I said no. About an hour went by and it was getting late, and the bar was fixing to close. All of a sudden, the young woman taps me on the shoulder and says, “Here is my number, call me tomorrow!” and she turns around and leaves.

I declared “already” and grabbed the $100 off the bar. The bartender thought it was a set up. It wasn’t, and I gave her $20 and kept $80. Well the next day during lunch break at work, I called the number and this girl answers and I said, “This is Chris, you gave me your number last night.” She replied “Oh yeah, I’m Lisa. But I don’t want to talk to you, I want you to talk to my sister Gloria. She’s working now, but is this your number?” I told her yes, and she said, “I’m going to text you my sister’s number and you call her.”

Well I called her, and I asked, “What’s up, this is Chris and I met your mom and sister.” So we start talking on the phone every day. We would fall asleep on the phone. I didn’t meet her, but she lived right around the corner. We were both scared. Well before I met her I told her over the phone, “I know this might sound crazy since I never met you, but I love you.” And she said, “You’re just telling me that because you want to have sex.” I replied, “Nah, for real I’m falling in love with you.”

Well, I started telling my grandma about this girl, and my grandma said, “I want to meet her first. So I agreed. Anyway one day I met Gloria, and it was love at first sight. I didn’t see nothing wrong with her. It was dark outside, and I couldn’t see her too well, but I knew she was the one. She had a 32oz Budweiser in a brown paper bag, and I was like “OMG this chick is ghetto,” but she didn’t look or act ghetto.

So I said, “She told me she drinks so it ain’t no surprise.” Well after that we kept talking. I kept telling my grandma about her. So I finally took Gloria to meet my Grandma. Let me tell you that my grandma pretty much raised me, and she has stood by my side no matter what. She is my rock.

Well Gloria comes over to my grandma’s, and right when she walks inside, Gloria says, “Ms. Josie, is that you?” My grandma’s name is Josie. Gloria and my grandma used to work with each other. My grandma kept a picture of me on her desk and supposedly Gloria used to tell my grandma “Hook me up with your grandson, Ms. Josie. I’m going to take him away from you.”

My grandma said, “Nope, he’s mine, you can’t have him.” Anyway, we all talk and stuff, and after Gloria leaves, my Grandma tells me, “Mijo, she’s a good woman. Treat her good.” So that was that. We have been together since and have 4 kids together. At this time, I haven’t heard from her, but I’m fixing to get out, and I will do everything in my power to get her and my kids back. The word of God says, “The Lord will restore my family if I just trust in our Lord and God Jesus Christ.” And that is what I’m doing. Please keep me in your prayers. For Morales family: Michael Chris Morales, Gloria, JayJay, Rubi, Mexus, and Aiden. Thank you, and God bless.
