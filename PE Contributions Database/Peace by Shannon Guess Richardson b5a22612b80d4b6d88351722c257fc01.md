***Peace* by Shannon Guess Richardson**

What is peace? According to Marcel Morin, it “does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hand work. Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in your heart.”

You caught me in my special happy place, where I once went to get away from the world and the distractions that come with it. I was meditating on the fateful day, just as you see me now, when a group of people approached me. Initially, I was frustrated because my special place had been found. Then I was simply confused. The people were on their knees before me with their heads down. It took me a while to realize these people mistook me for someone holy. Ha! What a joke that was! If only they knew I had spent 23 years of my life in Federal Prison for a home invasion with weapons.

I have always been a practical jokester at heart. I was that annoying kid in school who always wanted to make people laugh. Not one to miss an opportunity, I told them of my special powers in my best Middle Eastern accent. They were so blown away that I didn’t think I would ever get rid of them!

It was my turn to be blown away when a huge crowd of people showed up. People were throwing piles of money at me to heal them. Why did they think I could heal them? Probably because I told the original group of people that it was my “special powers.” Don’t judge me!

I was in a bit of a predicament. I had only been out of prison for 3 years and was still struggling, but there I was with piles of cash being thrown at me. What would you do?

I finally sent a text for my girlfriend, Crystal, to meet me there. That probably wasn’t the best idea. Crystal, a petite blonde, showed up in her metallic blue, hard-top Corvette with the windows down, radio blaring, and bass booming. I heard her coming a mile away! She wasn’t exactly the ideal image of a “holy” girlfriend, walking over in her Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots.

When she got there, I was ankle deep in cash, putting my hands on people. What a sight that must have been! I would mumble something, and they’d either faint on claim of being healed. I was getting so good at the healing thing that I was beginning to believe it myself! The mind is such a powerful thing.

When the money flow stopped, Crystal whisked me away in her can with the promise that I would be back the next day. I was at war with my guilty conscience, but in the end, money won. We would definitely be going back the next day.

This went on for several weeks. I didn’t know where all the people came from, but as long as they were bringing money, I didn’t care. We had so much money that we didn’t know what to do with it. But it wasn’t enough. Is it ever enough? Greed will get you every time.

A man who called himself Rico approached me one evening. He said he was a reporter and was going to let the world know I was a fake then send me to jail. All of a sudden, he fell down to the ground in a slump in front of me. That’s when I saw Crystal with a large rock in her hands. I checked on the mand, and he was gone. There were screams behind me. I turned to see the crowd watching us: they were running away and screaming. I knew it was only a matter of time before I saw the blue lights and heard the siren of a police car.

Crystal said she was going to get the money and run to Costa Rica. She was yelling at me to hurry, but I was frozen as I heard her take off without me.

They say hindsight is 20/20, but what they don’t tell you is that it also makes you feel like an idiot. All I wanted was peace. Now, as you can see, I’m back in my special place trying to recapture my peace before they send me back to prison. Peace. Such a simple word, but so hard to find.
