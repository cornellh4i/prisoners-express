***The Rain Wash Away* by Jason Gonzalez**

It was raining the last time I saw you. I ran sixteen blocks through the downpour because I couldn’t stand it anymore. I cut through every shortcut and back alley I could remember. I dodged oncoming traffic and angry old ladies smoking Virginia Slims outside a bar. I ran through a street fight and slipped on the corner near the Chinese place where we used to get takeout.

I ran because there was a hole in my heart where there should have been none. I ran because I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t. I ran because I had to try.

I kept thinking of everything we had been through. The early mornings when you would wake me up so you could spend time with me before you left. The late nights on the back porch with the breeze in our face and the stars over our heads.

I remembered our New Year’s trip to Chicago. Climbing the beached paddle wheel ship and watching the fireworks from the balcony. Huddling close to fight off the chill wind from the lake then your shivering so hard that you wrapped yourself in my coat, and my shivering so hard that you wrapped me in your arms.

I kept thinking how you could make me laugh. Your deadpan face as I asked you what kind of person on the face of the Earth could not like ice cream, and your telling me someone who’s lactose intolerant. My threatening to throw you in an oven and burn you in a horrible, fiery death, and your telling me good luck because it will take a while to pre-heat.

I closed my eyes and heard the sound of your voice. The wind blew, and I felt the touch of your hair against my face. I thought about you from the moment I woke until the moment I slept.

You were there through the hard times. You lifted me through the pain and the hurt and the loneliness. You were my strength, and I was your loyal bandman.

I looked in the mirror and saw your eyes reflected back at me. That small smile when you were happy--that smile that seemed to say, I know you love me. I love you too, but I’ll never tell. That look on your face when you were worried about me--the look that let me know you would protect me from every harm.

A fire burned inside me as I thought about the day I told you I had to leave. You didn’t understand that it wasn’t your fault. I didn’t know how to tell you how damaged I was. That I had lost the ability to love. That I had been through every hell imaginable and had nothing left to give.

I didn’t know how I would explain to you that you were the only thing on my mind from that day to this one. Didn’t know how I would explain that all I wanted to do was brush your hair behind your ears and see your face. To have you lay your head on my shoulder. To hold you. To kiss you. To feel you. To love you again.

So I ran. Through rain and puddles and traffic. I ran until my muscles burned and my body ached. I ran until my heart beated hard enough to tear a hole in the universe. I ran until my body shuddered and my soul cried out for mercy.

Then I ran some more.

When I rounded the corner, you were there. I stopped, not sure what to do next. You were standing in the rain with the umbrella creating a halo of untouched space in a world washed away. You were as beautiful as I remembered. More than I remembered. Your dark hair blowing gently with the breeze. Your eyes bright. That small smile on your face.

I wish I had realized at the time. I would have walked away. I would have gone before you saw me. Before you slowly turned your head and our eyes met across the time and distance that had separated us for so long.

Your eyes told the story. Hiding your emotions was always easy for you, but your eyes give it all away. At that moment I knew that smile on your face wasn’t for me.

I was soaked to the bone and nearly hypothermic. The cold didn’t make me shiver; it was the concerned look in your eyes. The one that told me you knew how much I was hurting. The one that let me know that all you wanted to do was run to me, hold me, and protect me.

As the rain ran down my face, and my fingers turned to ice, I knew I had made another mistake. I had complicated your life again, but this time I had a chance to stop it before it went too far. This time I had a chance to make it right.

I like to think that in that moment, our eyes said everything we never could to each other. I like to think that you heard me say the words I love you even though I never did. That you knew that I thought you were the best person I had ever met in my life. That all I ever wanted was to see you smile. That I wanted nothing more than for you to be happy, even if that wasn’t with me. That’s why, when he came down the driveway, put his hand on your face and kissed you, all I could do was offer you a small smile of my own as I walked away.

Those sixteen blocks back were the longest walk of my life. I wanted to hold onto your face. I wanted to remember the way you looked then, but I couldn’t. It became distorted and hazy, blown away by the new pain that crept into my being. The pain and the hurt and the heartache: the only things left that I could feel.

I passed the Chinese place. The ice cream stand where the cone melted down my arm in the 95 degree heat that one summer day, making you laugh harder than I’ve ever heard you laugh before. The park where we would lay in the grass and you would ask me any crazy question that popped into your head. The flower shop where I bought you the bouquet after you graduated. The candy store where I bought you the chocolate you love and left it on your pillow on Valentine’s Day.

Memories everywhere. Everything. All around me. Invading every sense, every corner of my mind. But the only thing I wanted to remember was you.

I made it home and stood in front of the door. I was numb. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I felt the weight of the water coming down on my face. I looked to the sky for answers. I demanded them from God, from the universe, from someone, from anyone. I stood and let the rain wash over me, the world’s tears mingled with mine.

The next day the rain still fell. The world outside and my world inside were still broken. I cleaned up, dressed, and ate mechanically, without feeling, without care. I grabbed my bag and an umbrella and headed for the door.

As I stepped out onto the sidewalk, I popped open the umbrella. The halo of unwashed space surrounded me. I closed my eyes and took a breath, letting the rain wash away everything I couldn’t seem to let go of. I turned down the street and started to go.

That’s when I saw you standing in the rain.
