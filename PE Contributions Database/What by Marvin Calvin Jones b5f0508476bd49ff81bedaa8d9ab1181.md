***What?* by Marvin Calvin Jones**

****I met these two cuties at my neighborhood diner one day. One was all smiles and giggles while the other was trying extra hard to be hard. She lit up her cigarette, put it to her pretty lips and puffed with this far off look in her eyes as though she was trying to remember something important. She glanced at me and rolled her green eyes. I shook my head and said to her friend, “ Can I get your number?” She said, “Sorry handsome, but I’m with her,” and to emphasize her point, she slipped her arms around her friend’s waist; what she meant became crystal clear. As they giggled at my shocked expression and walked away, I wondered, “When did life get so complicated?” Years later, I bumped into Ms. Smiles and Giggles, only she no longer smiled or giggled. I asked where her friend was, and she stated, “She died of cancer.” … One cig too many had taken the smile off her face and the giggle from her heart.
