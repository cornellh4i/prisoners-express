**Nourishment by Yankee Lawyer**

I’m a peanut butter freak.

On the street, I ate three or four peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a day. In prison, peanut butter is not readily available, but the main problem, besides the limited availability of peanut butter, is bread. When I have peanut butter, I’m constantly looking for something to put it onto.

The prison menu was bad enough a couple of decades ago, but it's getting steadily worse. We get meat less often than we did a few years ago. What meat we get is often in mystery meat patties based on soybeans. Soy seems to have replaced tobacco as North Carolina’s principal agricultural product.

We’re told soy is very nutritious, but when we ask for specific facts, none are forthcoming. Experimental knowledge informs me that soy products are unappetizing. My research informs me further of one salient fact: long term high soy content diets have been associated with heart attacks.

The pigs also took ice cream and gelatin and jelly away from us several years ago. So my hair is thinning and my nails keep breaking. Inmates with money can sometimes get pectin in canteen food, but I cannot.

When you have no jelly to go with your peanut butter, you need a good drink. There is no substitute for milk. It’s the only natural food even more nearly perfect than peanuts (and the bottles usually add vitamin D). Maybe that is why whole milk is no longer available in most prisons.

Thank God a prisoner can still get nourishment from the Bible. Still nothing aids my study like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a few crispy chocolate chip cookies, and a tall glass of cold milk.
