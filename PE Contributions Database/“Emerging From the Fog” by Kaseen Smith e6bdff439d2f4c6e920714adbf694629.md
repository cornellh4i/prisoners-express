**“Emerging From the Fog” by Negromorphisis the Alchemist**

We stand in complete confusion as pure pandemonium erupts in our own backyards. Jake, whose name is not important, blindly runs for cover as another gunslinger produces more horrible news; creating an orchestra of sirens and screams to rule the air, unable to see what’s in front of him let alone what could come back to haunt him from the rear. Jake, crouched behind a car with both hands over the ears, remains completely stiff and is now open to prayer. (As we both know actions speak louder than words).

He’s barely able to breathe, due to the smoke religiously pounding his lungs with the intent to suffocate him to death. As he fights to stay alive, Jake hears a recognizable sound from a distance, but not too far away. Listening attentively to the foggy portrait, he begins to discern the sound with limpidity… It’s a cry from a lost child.

Without hesitation he searches blindly on his hands and knees as if it was his own which was missing. Sacrificing his body as glass rips through the flesh savagely, almost as if its intent was to make Jake stand up in order to get hit by a bullet not prejudiced at the time… Yet the man with courage presses on.

The closer he gets to the lost child, the more it seems his life is at risk as he crawls with no parked cars, which were used as shields. As more shots continue to hit innocent targets, he begins to move faster yelling, “Child can you hear me?!” No answer, just a cry for help.

Making at the image at this point, he could see a standoff… Police firing relentlessly with prejudice. A child shooting more religiously without prejudice as well as other mentally disabled groups who felt like God spoke to them.

While we petition to some god requesting the return of some savior, Kaseen is telling you it’s time to emerge from the fog. It first starts at home, then in our communities. Parents, our children are the future… Love them and they will not turn out bad like the cops who represent NYC. We don’t need another racist gunslinger.
