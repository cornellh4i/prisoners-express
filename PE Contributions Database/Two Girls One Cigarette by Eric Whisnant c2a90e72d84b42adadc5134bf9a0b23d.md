**Two Girls One Cigarette by Eric Whisnant**

We are halfway to Hollywood, Karen, I just knew when we get there we will make our dreams come true. We are young and beautiful and the Marlboro Man don’t got shit on me. Look, watch this, don’t I look like a better idea than the Marlboro Man?

Samantha, you’re crazy as hell. We are stuck outside a small diner with no money or ride and you’re smoking our last cigarette.

Karen, I bet you if I hold this pose long enough and allow this body to be seen we will be out of here in 30 minutes. Well on our way.

Girl you’re crazy!

No seriously, watch this. How do I look?

Crazy as hell! Like Fonzie with tits!
