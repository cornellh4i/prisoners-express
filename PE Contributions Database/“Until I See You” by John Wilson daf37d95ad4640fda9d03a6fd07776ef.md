**“Until I See You” by John Wilson**

Irceja wandered around the family library, restless with boredom. The room was large, taking up the entire third floor of the manor, a labyrinth of shelves. Each generation of the family added books, so all of the shelves were filled. Once, her ancestor, the one who built the manor, claimed that he read every book in this library--substantial even in his time--because no book was put on the shelf until he finished it. No one could say that today.

She turned a corner to one of the rows of shelves along the outer wall and started looking at books, trying to find one that engaged her interest Just as she was about to replace a book she picked up, a gleam of metal caught her attention. She removed two more books to reveal a small handle set in the back of the bookcase.

A minute’s experimentation showed her to pull backward until she felt a click and then turn, and the bookcase opened. The hinges resisted a bit, showing they hadn’t been opened in a long time, but they were superbly balanced like a normal door.

It led to a small room about eight feet wide and twenty feet long. Shelved lined all four walls with an open book on a stand in the center, leaving only the door bare. Dust laid thick on everything, and Irceja swiped a hand across the spines to her right before gasping: they were all classical books on magic, and she recognized a few that have been considered lost for decades. It was a treasure trove.

She walked the perimeter of the room before approaching the stand. This book was different. Large sheets filled with minute hand scripts in two columns were held by clear, plastic slipcovers. Three large, three-ring clamps were screwed to the wooden binding. She read the opened page, the last entry of the journal dated almost 600 years ago. It said, “Today, IASHSTIEM passed into the Summerland. Per his final wishes, I (Trisha Lanaghan, his homecare nurse) typed this final entry, printed it up, and placed in into his Book. He died peacefully at 119, surrounded by three generations of his family. His final words were, ‘It’s time. I love you all.’ He will be missed.”

An electric thrill went down Irceja’s spine. If this really was the Book of Shadows, it was worth more than all of the books on the shelves combined because as legend says, it contained the true knowledge of all magic.

For a moment, she wondered how it came to rest in a hidden section of her family’s library, until something caught her eye. There was a small cloth bag with feathered drawstrings lying at the edge of the pages. Irceja picked it up and carefully opened it. Inside were two small feathers, a stone, a seed, and four small wooden slats, and other small items. She returned it because she knew not to mess with magical objects without fully understanding them. However, on a whim, she closed the Book and carried it to her room.

After many attempts and failures at school where she studied magic, she met the guardian of the threshold. He told her, “Only I can give you the keys to the realms beyond to which you seek entrance, and I won’t do that until I can see you.” He had no face, just pale smooth skin.

Irceja relaxed a bit. The book spoke of the threshold guardians, though it gave little information on how to overcome the challenge each individual one posed. “How about this?” she asked. She leaned forward and grabbed his wrist, then placed his hands over her face. He ran his hands up and down, feeling her nose and ears and tracing her lips and eyebrows.

He shook his head, “I had hoped, but I cannot see you. You may not pass.” He gave her permission to try again at another time. “I will be waiting.”

She attempted to pass the guardian several times over the next week, but nothing worked. She even tried to simply slip away, but as she turned, he was in front of her with his hands outstretched to stop her. He shook his head, “Many who have come before me have tried that, but it does not work. I know you are there, but I cannot see you. You may not pass until I see you.”

That night, she had a dream that he chased her with his hands outstretched, demanding that she give him her eyes. As the guardian was placing her eyes in his head, his palms were flat against the smooth expanse where his face should be.

When she woke up, she wasn’t left with a nightmare but with an idea. Thinking about the books fleshed out her ideas more, and she studied even when she met with him again. He waited patiently before she finally put the book aside and reached for a make-up kit.

Instructing the guardian to put his hands over his non-existent face, she began to draw a face on the back of his hands. She felt the hands were key to this: every time he stopped her, he did it by holding out his hands. Therefore she needed to occupy them somehow. The instructions on drawing realistic faces from the book translated directly into skill. She saved the eyes for last, spending the most time with them and adding the most detail.

Once she finished, the face took on additional depth. The eyes sparkled, and the mouth moved in a slight smile. Irceja couldn’t tell if the effect was achieved by some subtle motion of his hands, or if the drawing really became his face. In any case, it didn’t matter.

“I see you, young wizard-to-be. You may now pass.”
