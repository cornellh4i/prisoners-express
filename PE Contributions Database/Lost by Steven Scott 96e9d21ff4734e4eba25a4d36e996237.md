****When we were brought into this world, we were inexperienced. The inevitable trail of learning to walk is a natural process of life. We were aided by our parents’ strong and steady fingers of support to make those short steps to long strides. Throughout life, there will be times when we are inexperienced in activities, jobs and unfortunate situations. Forgone from our mothers’ bosom, we must look within ourselves for support and true guidance. To know where you want to go in life, you first must truly know yourself. There have been times in my life where my conscious plan was thwarted for adventure and the feel-good-right-now vanities of lawlessness. I was lost. Not knowing myself truly, I made deviations in my plan for the exciting fast lane. Towing away from my simple plan of a family, kids, career, etc., I chose the limelight of felonious social acceptance. Not living my life for my own happiness, but for others’ happiness in me. We all get lost. The point is we make the choice to find out what we want out of life and not be afraid to go make it happen for ourselves.
