My first job was unpaid and for a class. Junior year of high school, I had a teacher that gave unpaid jobs since she wanted us to do community service instead of getting a decent amount of money for working. One day, she told a group of twelve to be ready for a surprise interview the next day, and then we were put on the school bus and driven downtown. The bus dropped off our teacher and us at the Public Defender’s office.

I had no particular interest working at this office, and so I was hopeful when we were told that four of us would not be hired. The first intern interviewed us and was second in command over the whole office. I thought I showed just enough disinterest that I would not get a job. The next day, I was told I had a job.

I was put in the Mental Health Department which consisted of two Public Defenders and one case worker. This department had just opened so they actually gave them some cool stuff, like brand new laptop computers while other Public Defenders had ten year old desktop computers. They had brand new wireless headset phones while everybody else had 30 year old corded phones. Most of the Public Defenders did not have cell phones issued to them. The department also had brand new leather swirling office chairs, though most of the other public defenders had only folding chairs they used to sit at their desk. They were given a long distance telephone code so they could make long distance calls. No one else was allowed to make long distance calls.

My job mainly consisted of filing paperwork, and every now and then, I’d mail and type letters. At first, I had things to do every day, but after a few months, I had less. The Mental Health Department was never there; they were always in the field or at a seminar. At times, I would think that the Department was simply a money laundering operation. I never once saw one of our clients. The files said we had five hundred clients, but I never saw a single one or even the two attorneys in court the one day it said we had court. I was interested to see what it looked like. At the last moment, court was cancelled. The last few months, they were never there. I only showed up on the days I had to get evaluated and get my form signed for my class grade. The office manager was always the one who signed my evaluation form since the Mental Health Department was never in office.
