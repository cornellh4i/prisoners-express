**by Ambus R. Davis-El**

****It was a warm evening on May 24, 1977, and I was balled up in the darkness of space, void of light, deep within. My first job was not a unique one at all, as all living human beings have had the liberty of partaking in this particular field of expertise.

I had the luxury of being able to work with my mother. Our duty together was to bring infinite intelligence into this world manifested within carnal matter. Sound scientific? It is very much so…

From the womb of my mother, I was created into thought, then into physical matter, and I then, from the darkness of the womb, proceeded to unfold into the beautiful flower that blooms in its due season.

As my mother and I continued to wrought at bringing light into the world, she pushed, I found, and we did an extraordinary task. We fought and fought until I made my way through the vaginal cavity and pushed toward the light at the beginning of the tunnel. The light I was and the light of the world at the end of the tunnel would naturally become one.

The sun was born, and the light illuminated the room in Parkland Hospital. Here I am, unfolded perfectly from the darkness into the light. I was slapped on my rear end in order to inhale… exhale… “Ahha!” I cry, taking notice of life, air, sight, smell, and my consciousness. My life is a gift from the Most High.

My life was given to me, and my job was to take my first breath. Most people fail to realize that we had to work to get into this beautiful world, but I understand and cherish the job in which I worked diligently to be successful.

Therefore, we all must adhere to the calling of the CEO of the entire universe to do a job well done. The job of life, to take that first breath.
