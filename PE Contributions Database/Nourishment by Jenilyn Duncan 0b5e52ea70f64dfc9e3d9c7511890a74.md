**Nourishment by Jenilyn Duncan**

When I think of nourishment, I think of food, spiritual health, physical strength and mental health.  Does it matter which food groups you eat? It does if you want to have a balanced diet! You can pick from a variety of rainbows of fruits and vegetables. How do we really get nourished? For me it’s plenty of water, rest, and eating food in a timely manner. Using grains, fruits, milk, vegetables, meat vitamins and minerals; all of these groups are good in moderation.

Finding scripture in a time of need definitely nourishes my spirit. When I pray for others it is as important as exercising  mental health and physical health.

Caring and sharing positive ideas lifts up both parties involved. I take care of myself first and then others because I have found that I can’t give from an empty cup.
