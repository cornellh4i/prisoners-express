**Stars by Bobby Ball**

****Time has allowed me to massage you mentally before I continue. Allow me to extend my respects to you and your family. As for me, I can’t and will not complain: it’s not in my DNA. Your voice is truly missed. I crave your undivided attention. My intentions are to always please, heal, motivate, and satisfy by all means. Do I deserve your honesty in its totality? Regardless of the answer, I have nothing against you. Never forget this people. Teach people how to treat others. You are appreciated dearly. Know this, even though you may feel otherwise, my star.
