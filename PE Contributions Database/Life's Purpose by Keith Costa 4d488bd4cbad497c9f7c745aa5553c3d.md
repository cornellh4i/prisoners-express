**“Life’s Purpose” by Keith Costa**

My purpose was to be a dirtbag. Commit every crime I could conceive of and get arrested. Bail out on 15 felonies at $140,000 and get picked back up within 24 hours. Post bail within 2 weeks on a total of 31 felonies and get out with one intention: be a dirtbag. Within 3 months, I’m unconscious after fighting with the cops, and I’ve got 63 felonies.

My purpose was to be shocked that I was going to prison. Shocked that I had to accept responsibility. Shocked the cops lied. Shocked my wife and co defendant served me annulment paperwork and cooperated.

My purpose was to grow up in prison. My purpose was to survive. My purpose was to meet Prisoner Express and read everyone’s works. My purpose was to land in the gutters so I could climb out and realize my purpose. I will spend the rest of my life helping others going down the wrong path in life… so they don’t have to experience all that I have. I will spend what’s left of my life going back for all that I took.
