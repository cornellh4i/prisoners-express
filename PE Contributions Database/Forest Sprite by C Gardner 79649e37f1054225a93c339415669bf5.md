**Forest Sprite by C Gardner**

Craig sat in an old wooden tree stand on the edge of a forest, overlooking a meadow blanketed by fog. Clad in his camouflage overalls, he peered through the miasma with his binoculars, trying to see any sign of life.

He had carefully chosen this spot after months of recon. It was a beautiful hardwood forest with tall, proud oaks and crab apple trees that all deer loved to frequent. It was near a cool freshwater stream, and offered tall thickets of grass and brush to blend into.

He had seen plenty of deer rubs and scrapes, as well as deer tracks and droppings along the well-worn trails to lead him to believe that he would be able to fill the deer tag in his pocket. But despite all the preparations, he had yet to bag the buck he had come for, and today was the last day of deer season. He did not want to go home empty-handed again.

He was well prepared. He had whatever he might need close at hand. Leaning against the railing was his .50 caliber, muzzle-loaded, black powder rifle. He had also brought plenty of black powder percussion caps and ammunition in case he needed to reload. But that would only happen if he missed. And, as Craig would be quick to point out, he didn’t miss.

Craig put down the binoculars, readjusted his orange safety hat and sat back heavily in his chair. He reached into his backpack and pulled out one of the pickle and pimento loaf sandwiches that his wife Carol had thoughtfully prepared the night before. He opened the sandwich bag with great care not to make too much noise and took a large, satisfying bite.

Just then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the stag. He came out into the clearing, staying close to the tree-line. He was a beautiful white-tail buck, a twelve pointer, with an impressive pair of antlers. His nose was twitching nervously, and one hook hung frozen in mid-air below his massive chest.

Craig slowly put down his sandwich and reached for his weapon. Pulling the stock to his shoulder, his eyes never left the buck. As he sighted the deer’s quivering front, Craig imagined that he could see the creature’s beating heart beneath the grey pelt. He clicked off the safety and drew in a deep breath. Slowly he exhaled, a plume of breath that blossomed in the cool fall air. When he had emptied his lungs, he pulled the trigger. The gun’s report broke the still morning air, its echo richocetting in the distance. But instead of seeing the big deer’s fallen carcass, he only saw the twitch of its tail as it disappeared into the forest. Craig was dumbfounded. He knew that he had hit that deer, but nevertheless it was gone.

He dropped out of the tree-stand and ran over to the spot where the deer had been. There, sprinkled on the leaves of the bushes around the spot of grass, were drops of blood. His bullet had found its mark. Now Craig would have to track down the dying creature.

“Shit,” Craig whispered to himself. He ducked under a tree branch and began to follow the spoor.

He had only walked a short distance when he came upon the fallen deer, but to his surprise, standing next to the deer was a small girl. She was wearing a long white dress that fell to her ankles, and she stood barefoot in the clearing. Her chestnut brown hair cascaded in curls down her slender back. Around her forehead was an ivy garland laced by tiny white flowers. She was bent over the deer, and pulling at a cluster of flowers growing on a hedge just behind the deer’s body. She pulled the flowers from the bush and laid them tenderly on its lifeless form. She knelt by its side and placed a soft kiss on its blood-spattered muzzle. She then whispered something into its ears that Craig could not hear.

Suddenly, the deer woke. Its ears twitched and in a panic it shot to its feet and stood bewildered in the clearing. It looked first at Craig, then at the little girl. It bowed its antlered head low in her direction, turned and bounded into the deep forest’s cover.

Craig stood confused, his empty weapon held impotently in his hands.

“What just happened?” Craig asked. Then he pointed to the little girl. “Who are you? What did you just do?”

“I am the spirit guide to all the innocent animals. And that deer’s life was not yours to take.” She walked towards Craig with a confidence that betrayed her tender appearance. With one hand she took Craig’s empty weapon from his slack, unbelieving grip. Inexplicably, he allowed her.

“This instrument of death is your no more. This forest is sacred, and its creatures are all precious gifts whose lives are to be cherished, not taken for idle pleasures,” she said with a serene grace.

Craig began to regain his senses, but before he could protest she took the rifle in both hands and snapped it in two over her knee. She held her hands, palms down, over the broken pieces and sang a soft song in a language Craig had never heard before. A warm glow issued from her fingers and warmed the entire clearing. She stood and walked back to Craig and took his trembling hand in both of hers, pulling it to her chest. She leaned her head against his hand and continued to sing.

A tiny sprout issued from the ground, and with seemingly no effort began to grow. First into a sapling, then into a young tree and then into a proud and mighty oak whose leaves and branches disappeared into the canopy above.

Craig, who had been watching the tree rise, looked back down to the little girl but found himself alone, in a clearing in a peaceful forest. Confused, he wandered back to his truck and drove away.
