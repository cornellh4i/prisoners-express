**The Step to Asmidiska by Edward Cortex Williams Jr.**

Down Miga road, going as the New Moon appears, that first sliver of light after the dark moon… That’s when the door to Asmidiska was said to appear. Every thirty-three years.

Thirty-three years ago, Taissa’s father left home, rambling about some place called Asmidiska. He seemed both harrowed and lost, not making much sense as he announced his coming travels. He said he had found a treasure, but he looked like a man that was scared for his life. He told Taissa a story that night about stars and gold and mountains. It made no sense at all. His incoherent babbling had scared her, but she did not protest. He kissed her goodnight and she never saw him again. She was five

Now she was thirty-eight and she stood on the road that led into the Nebulous mountains. She had researched “Asmidiska” and could only find two things. One: Asmidiska was the name of a constellation that was studied in ancient times. Two: There was an old poem translated into English about such a term. It was made to rhyme as best as possible. It went:

Down Miga road, the big door appears

But only once every thirty three years

Take nothing with you on the day that you leave

On the new moon in the month of Aviv.

The released who travel, the treasure up high

Asmidiska in the years gone by

On the top of the mountain will you find a cave

It is deep, he is watching, so you better behave

The creepy poem had Taissa stopped in her tracks. Her pal Alia had parked the car a half mile back. She could always return to the vehicle and leave. But she didn’t want to be a scaredy-cat. She was almost forty! That obscure Middle Eastern poem was OLD. There was no WAY that the semitic peoples could have written it about something in America!

But still… people HAD found an ancient Paleo-Hebrew script on stones in America...maybe it COULD be true.

Whether it was real or not, Taissa wanted to see just what it was that her highly intelligent father had gone insane over. Though fear lay quietly under her goosefleshed skin, she took a deep breath of spring air and decided to begin this journey the same way her father did, the same way everyone does.

She took her first step.
