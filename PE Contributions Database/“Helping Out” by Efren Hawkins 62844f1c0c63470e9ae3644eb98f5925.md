**“Helping Out” by Efren Hawkins**

At this moment in my life, I am helping myself out. I’m trying to get a grasp on myself as I decide whether I’m gonna go left or right. I remember back in the days I wouldn’t even have enough time to weigh my options. I would have just did what I want to do and to hell with it. Can’t do it like to no more, because I am a better man. I have a million questions I seek answers for, but I can only find a few. In those answers I do find, they show me the emptiness of other questions I ask myself.

I remember I once used to ask myself, “Why are you still living?” Yeah, let it go, we’ve got bigger plan for you, was the answer I received. That showed me that I have a destiny and a mission to complete in life. I don’t truly know what it is yet, but I’m waiting to find out. This waiting is helping me build patience and a small measure of understanding life. You see life move along with each step you take, each breath you breathe, and each blink of your eyes. (Yeah, mine don’t always blink at the same time). But, all these actions are helping me out, plus many more. It allows me to see that when I gave up on myself. Many others didn’t give up on me. So, those prayers are being answered. “Thank you!”

You see, helping out is only two words, but they have an immeasurable meaning. Your smallest action to your biggest can help someone out. So, if you get a chance, help someone out, because you never know when you are going to need help. You never know if you can help yourself out, with the same tool you used to help someone else out. Each day we are here for a purpose and sometimes a bad decision we made was meant for our good. It gave us time to open our eyes and soul to the bigger picture. So, let’s take time to get this work of art right and yourself is your masterpiece. We can’t let Him down. He has been too good to us. It is this program that is helping me out in this time of need. When I read writings from different people, it shows me that we all struggle. Happy New Year and I am waiting to read your poetry and theme writings.
