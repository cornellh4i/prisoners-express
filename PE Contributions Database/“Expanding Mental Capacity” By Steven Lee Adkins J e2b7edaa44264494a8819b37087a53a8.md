**“Expanding Mental Capacity” By Steven Lee Adkins Jr.**

Emerging from the fog is my mind from time to time. Occasionally tasting my full potential before succumbing to the shrouding of external forces, engulfing my attention, my sight...myself. But in nature, nothing is static and I am part of nature. So, I await the time and place when I can again break free. From invisible chains that dig deep into cerebral flesh. The limitations and standards, suffocating and demoralizing as they may be, forced upon me at every turn since being born into this time and place. Knowingly bound by those in denial so their existing ways of life aren’t proven to be contrary to nature and humanity as they sense, but are too complacent to convenience to change or dare another way.

Waiting till they’re old and gray before relenting their denials but with reservations of self-justifications such as ‘I did the best I could- (no, you did not), ‘Well, it’s over now and what’s in the past stays in the past (equally not true). Could’ve but purposely did not.

Just because a government tells you this is the way of life, will arrest you if you resist said way of life, the time era owned by society will cold shoulder or ridicule you. If you live and believe differently from them, the blecting masses of sheeple; doesn’t mean you have to submit and conform. Fuck normalcy. Most notable folks from history weren’t accepted by the governments and peers of their era when they were breathing. They were judged, outcast as insane, arrested, called heretics, rebels, outlaws, tortured and/or killed.

Only those who tread far from the well beat on pain are remembered with any enthusiasm. And sometimes those paths meander. In and out of the fog.
