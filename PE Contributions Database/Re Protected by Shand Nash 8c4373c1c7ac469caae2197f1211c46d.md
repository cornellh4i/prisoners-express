**“Re: Protected” by Shand Nash**

Ras Tafari Chant

Princes shall come out of Egypt,

Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hands to the creator

Oh though creator of ethiopia,

Thou creator of divine majesty,

Thy spirit comes within Rastafari’s heart to dwell.

In the path of righteousness;

That the hungry be fed, the sick nourished,

The aged protected and the infant cared for.

Teach me love and loyalty as it is in zion.

Deliver I an I from the hands of our enemies

That I may prove faithful for the last days.

When I an I enemy has passed and decayed

In the depth of the sea or in the belly of the beast

O’ Give us a place in thy kingdom for ever and ever.

So we hail our God/King Selassie I

Mighty God His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I,

The Negust Negast, the conquering Lion of Juda,

The elect of creator, Creater Earth Rightful Ruler,

Emperor Haile Selassie I,

Who sitteth in zion and reigneth

In the hearts of rastaman and rastawoman

Hear I an I

Bless I an I, and Sactify I an I,

And cause they true and loving face to shine upon I an I,

Rasta Children that I may be saved.

Jah Rastafari!!!!!!!!!!!

Above is the chanting (reading), based upon my faith as a Rastafarian. The ideology of my faith protects me from my enemies. That is the devil, whom I characterize as an evil spirit that uses its host (individuals), to attempt to take away the peace of true Rastafarians that are binded in their faith to be free from bondage.

When one thinks of the word “protected,” one thinks of a firearm, presumably. But inside a place like this, you have to protect your mind and your health to survive in these end of days.

I remembered like it was yesterday, a nightmare that has haunted me for almost a decade now. In July, 2008, I placed myself in harm's way to protect someone that was battling fourth-stage cancer. Within seconds to think, reluctantly I had to take a person’s life. Do I have remorse? Every single day, especially at pre-trial, upon hearing the victim’s baby-mom stating, “We just had a baby girl.” I felt a lump in my stomach, remembering not having grown up with my biological father which I must add was difficult growing up in a third world country.

The most heart-wrenching moment was watching the person that I was protecting take the witness stand and blatantly lie to protect his own self. I, being so hurt inside, decided to call upon my Empress. Upon hearing another male answering my Empress’s phone, I had to protect my heart, mind, body and soul.

Then here it comes, my first fight in jail; now I have to protect my honor as a man. Yep, won that round, but the second one changed my life drastically: it was with an officer. Unbeknownst, to me, the individual that I had to fight was the officer’s friend.

Here I am, fighting murder in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in second degree, and two assault charges. The only thing that I had to protect my sanity was my faith.

As years went by, I finally had the assault and criminal possession of a weapon charges dismissed. Then I was acquitted of murder (which goes with a mandatory 25 to life) and faced manslaughter in the first degree; I received twenty-two years.

As Aaliyah once said, “Age ain’t nothing but a number,” and that’s the same perspective that I have in regards to being sentenced: “it can/will be given back.” Meanwhilst, I have to protect the inner being of myself, so I don’t get into the politics inside these prison walls.

I’ve seen a lot, of which I don’t wish to go into details but one thing that I can speak on: if one does not protect their deep inner-thoughts and desire to be free then, reluctantly I will say, this cage will be their home.

I’ve witnessed individuals get one and a half to three years convictions who are now facing fifty years to life. That’s real talk. Then I’ve heard inmates shout their last breath, after taking their own life. Then I hear prisoners being beaten to death.

Again, if I was not protected by my faith, then my mind would have given up a long time ago. But when one is looking forward to something/someone in life then one masters the “art of survival,” behind these prison walls. Before I close out on this bio-topic, I just want the readers to know that crime does not pay, but an honest job will.

Also, protect your loved one’s heart, because whoever the individual is, they are doing time with you. Their heart is locked up also. So, in conclusion, provide and protect your offspring so they can/will never see the inside of these walls.
