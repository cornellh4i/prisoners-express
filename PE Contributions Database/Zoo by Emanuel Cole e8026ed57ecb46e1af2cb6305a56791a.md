**Zoo by E. Andrea Cole**

Many people compare prison to a zoo. And, from what I’ve seen and experienced, especially back here in Ad. Seg., I can understand how those kinds of comparisons can be made. Hell, this place can be a madhouse at times.

But here at the Coffield Unit in Tennessee Colony, TX, I see things way differently. You see, to me, this isn’t a zoo, but a nature preserve.

I’m from the projects in South Dallas. All you see there is cracks in the concrete, trash, anger, and anguish. But here at Coffield, I see cats on a daily basis. They’re a regular piece of the scenery. And the skunks. And the possums. Both the skins and the possums are as big as the cats.

One of the opossums comes close enough for me to feed him (her?) on occasion. I call him Henry. For some reason, he seems like a wise old man to me. Henry’s my buddy.

Everything is all about perspective. We respond to the people and places surrounding us according to our perceptions of them so I’ll just keep looking at the nature preserve before me. The real “zoo” awaits me when I get released in seven months.
