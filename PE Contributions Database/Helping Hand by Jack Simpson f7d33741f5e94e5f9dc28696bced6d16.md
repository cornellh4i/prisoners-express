**Helping Hand by Jack Simpson**

This day was really hot for summer. It hadn’t rained in two weeks, The yard had started to lose its luster. What was green and alive was no more than a dying wasteland.

We were on a water restriction. The town gave an alert to everyone to be conservative and under no circumstances to water their grass.

The trusty Murray mower, which I had pushed for a couple of summers, was now back in action. No money would be made this way, not everyone wanted dust flowing from the ground. So this was not what I had been hoping for. What I did make put bread, milk, and other items on the table.

I had finished our yard and now was hoeing the curb. Now this is the part where grass growing down the yard meets the top of the concrete curb. Once In a while a few sparks flew to let me know I was deep enough,

Our neighbor had asked if I would edge hers also. Since the only thing left to do was head for the swimming hole later, I didn't mind. This connected our property and since they had some age on the both of them, It was the right thing to do.

Cutting her grass was so easy. Most of the yard had trees in back with large rocks. Not much grass would grow there anyway. I did find out If you moved some of the leaves, there was all the worms you would need for a couple of days. Boy do I love to fish.

I will call the fellow next door Tom. He wasn’t home much, but when he showed up. He could walk. He did remind me of Otis Campbell off the Andy Griffith show. I only saw him when he was coming home. His glasses told the story about him walking sideways a lot. They were thick as a six ounce Coke bottle bottom.

It just so happened I was in our yard when I heard a commotion. His wife was giving him a fit. “Just look at you. You can’t even make It to the top step without facing all the way down the others,” she went on to say.

I ran over to see what had happened, and to my surprise there he was-on his side, with a small cut on his forehead. A little blood trickled down slowly. I asked him: “Are you alright?”

He just looked at me as if he never knew me. I tried my best to help him up the steps. His wife told me to let him up the steps. His wife told me to let him be. He could sleep outside tonight. This was not the way I was taught. With his help we both made It to the top step and on the porch. After I turned to leave, she latched onto the screen door.

This I do in life. People need a helping hand no matter the situation. It felt great to help my neighbor and that he wasn’t hurt that bad. I felt saddened when they both passed away later on. The street felt lonely without them.

This I knew deep down, that what happened to him warranted a helping hand, and I would do it all over again.
