Life’s Great Enigma

“When life gives you ___ make ______.”

The most exhilarating sensation that I have ever experienced happens while I stargaze toward the heavens in the sprawling Arizona desert. Isolated from any cities towns or industrial complexes, the otherwise inky black night sky is magically transformed into a living tapestry of tiny blinking lights. These sparkling little diamonds twinkle upon their velvety backdrop with unsurpassed, awe inspiring grandeur.

Imagine a trillion stars, billions of light years away displaying their brilliance to every living creature in the universe. This extraordinary spectacle has been imprinted indelibly upon my very soul and has reconnected me to the omniscient genesis of all life. I am deeply comforted by its spiritual serenity. Suddenly life interrupted. Questions begin to pop into my head, breaking my connection to the source. These questions have likely plagued mankind for nearly 200 thousand years. Back to the time of the earliest hominids as they explored the Oma Kibish lands of Southern Ethiopia. Looking up towards the heavens too many have wondered: Why am I here, what is my place amongst these cosmos?

These questions come not from the spirit of inner-self but rather from our self-serving ego. I begin looking outside myself for the answers, because I didn’t yet understand the truth which lies inherently within us all. Whenever I look up and meditate on the stars I feel my serenity, as if I am a part of something significant. Outside of this tranquility I feel infinitesimally small and insignificant.

The universe is approximately 15 billion years old. The planet earth? A fledgling couple of billion. Our planet is home to tens of thousands of varieties of life and human beings have placed us at the top of the food chain. We have become Gods amongst the beast, and yet our life expectancy barely warrants a blip on the cosmic radar of time. The earth is full of many lifeforms, both flora and fauna which outlive us “Gods.” My ego ask; why **AM** I here? What **IS** my purpose? Mankind has confidently created many deities in a vain attempt to justify our existence. We have built great temples and monuments to honor these gods all the while sacrfice both humans and animals to appease them. We have written God’s word for Him and followed these guidelines to feel close to Him.

“Thou shalt not kill.” What part of this commandment do we not understand? Since the horrific slaughter of children at the Sandy Hook elementary school there have been over 200 mass shootings in the United States alone! Human beings kill each other indiscriminately. So what should I hold onto, intelligent design or chaos theory? Have we been created in God’s own image or have we evolved from pond scum? Perhaps it is our actions which speak louder than words. . . A popular theory lately has been that perhaps God created the “Big Bang,” thus starting the evolutionary process. Alright then, I can live with that.

Imagine if you will that “The Source” (God) set off the big bang which set into motion 15 billion years of creation and then evolution. Maybe we were created in God’s own image; Well, eventually. . .And now presto, here we are!

In 2003 the “Human Genome Project” successfully sequenced and mapped out the entire human genome by unraveling our DNA. Are we now on the cusp of discovering God’s recipe for life? Perhaps. Sadly however this biggest question should not be “what is life,” but rather “what do I do with it?” Is the sole purpose of living and then dying to fulfill God’s will? Are we trudging through life simply to fulfill a prophecy? If you believe this I then also believe you may be a lunatic!

The bible says that “God is love.” It also instructs us to “love thy neighbor as we love ourselves.” Ah! Now that indeed sounds pretty straight forward. “All you need is love,” right John?

And now we have covered (or uncovered) a lot here. Cycling around full circle:

“When life gives you **TIME** make ___ ___ ___,”

Personally I don’t give a piddle about “how” life started, but I do cherish that which was given, love of life. This has not always been the case. In fact, I have ashamedly squandered away most of my life. I would like to examine this a little with you. The following is a “life chart” which I have created. Today’s date is March 22, 2019 to keep everything in perspective.

My time alive thus far = 21,286 days

My time spent in prisons = 10,612 days

My time spent as a free man = 10,674 days

My time spent as an addict = 11,141 days

My time spent in sobriety = 10,145 days

I have been imprisoned for 50% of my life as an alcoholic/addict. Let’s now put that into perspective.

Average life expectancy

For white, US male, 76 years = 27,740 days

My time which has elapsed = 21,286 days

Approximate Time remaining = 6,454 days

Earliest possible release date

3-20-21 (minus) = -730 days

---

Possible time left in life to life as a free man = 5,724 days

When we do pass away, our tombstone reveals the year in which we are born and the year of our demise. These dates are separated by a small (-) dash. That dash signifies the time to which we have been given to spend over our lives. My dash should be represented by a squiggly line. The greatest human resource is not life itself; it is the “Time” in which we’re allotted. The true question should be: “what do we do with our precious time?” For 10,612 of my days I have failed to use that time wisely. I should have been spending it loving all that there is to love, seeing all that there is to see, and hearing, smelling, feeling and tasting all that is out there to enjoy. Our time? Barely a blip on the cosmic clock.

How do you wish to spend your time? Getting high, drunk, envious, jealous, resentful, greedy, sad, lonely, angry, prideful, stubborn, sadistic, hurtful, regretful, mean, selfish, lustful, arrogant?

I have spent much of my time on these exact things. I have alienated myself from my family, my children, my friends and from society. Back in the 1970’s I can remember “Freddie Fender” singer: “Wasted days and wasted nights.” With this we can fill-in the rest of the theme question:

“When life give you time make ever second count!

Prologue

On March 14, 2019 I received a letter from a young lady whose name she with return address read only “L.” As it turned out “L” had questions about who her biological father was and did a DNA search. Voila! Turns out that I am he! Her letter broke my heart. “L” stated that she was afraid to write me in case I was to reject her. “L” also stated that she just wanted to know to whom she “belonged.” I wrote her a 25 page letter, sent a collection of family photos and a family tree dating back to the 1800s. I told her it is here, where you belong. I am anxiously awaiting her next letter. Wish us the best!
