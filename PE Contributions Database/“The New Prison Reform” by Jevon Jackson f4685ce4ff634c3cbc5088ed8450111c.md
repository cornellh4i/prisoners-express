**“The New Prison Reform” by Jevon Jackson**

Gloria visited her father at least every other week for the past year. She would take the two-hour drive from Waukesha to New Lisbon whether it was raining, hailing, or snowing. Every other Friday at 2:30 PM, she’d usually be the first or second visitor in the prison visiting room. She’d have a 20 ounce Sprite and a bag of Doritos from the vending machine already on the table for her father, even before he would enter the room with his big, hearty smile and faded green standard-issue uniform.

This was her father, Greg’s, first time being incarcerated. Although he only had a four-year sentence, it was a devastating ordeal for the entire family. Around holidays, Gloria would bring her mother, sister, and sometimes her uncle, along for the visit, but usually she would come alone. Like today.

It was early December, with increasing fog as she drove closer to the New Lisbon area. As she took the usual route, Interstate 90/94 to Highway 80, things started to look a little different as she turned onto Frontage Road. There was a snowy rock-lined stream where the road to the prison was located. A crowd of towering cypress trees sidelined the stream where, just two weeks ago, there was nothing but solid, paved concrete road.

Gloria stopped, sat in her minivan, bewildered, and checked her phone’s GPS. Maybe she had gotten lost because of the fog, she thought. But no, her GPS had her located directly on Progress Road which led straight to the facility. There was no road there anymore. To her right she noticed a deer, a young buck maybe, stepping out between the row of cypress trees, leaning over the stream to lap at the water. Two other deer joined him at the edge of the stream. The fog above began to dissipate. Gloria thought for a moment, then dialed the number for the prison. She had called there a few times before to double-check on delayed packages her father had asked her to send him. The staff there were usually nice to her. As the phone rang, Gloria stepped out of the minivan onto the snowy patches of rocks, and she couldn’t believe what she was seeing ahead with her own eyes. On the phone there was a CLICK, then a recording: “We’re sorry, the number you dialed is no longer in service. Please hang up and try again.” As the sky brightened and erased the fog away, Gloria saw a mountain standing exactly where the prison should be. This couldn’t be possible, she thought; she had to have taken a series of wrong turns somewhere.

Just then, Gloria heard a man’s voice. To her left, a gray, scraggly bearded man with a clipboard appeared from between the trees. He appeared to be mumbling to himself. His dingy Green Bay Packer hat was crooked on his head and his faded blue jean overalls hung like worn curtains on his tall, narrow frame. Startled to see her standing there, he stopped in his tracks. “Oh, howdy ma’am!” He pointed with the clipboard toward the general area of the trees. “I’m just takin’ inventory.”

“I’m… I’m sorry,” Gloria stammered, “I think I’m… I may be lost. I was driving to the

prison in New Lisbon to see my father and I… uh… I uh…. I don't know where I…”

“Oh, you didn’t git tha phone call, huh?” the man interrupted. “These bureaucrats–I tell ya!” he said, shaking his head. “If it ain’t a monkey shuckin’, it’s a turkey jivin’. Tha folks from the state were supposed ta call tha next-of-kin for all the fellas who were in there before tha big change come along an’ turn everythin’ around.”

“The ‘big change’? I don’t… I don’t understand.” Gloria looked intently at the tall man as he adjusted the Packers hat on his head.

“Tha big change,” the man sighed, solemnly stroking his beard. “Well, ‘bout a week ago, the institution mushroomed into a mountain and tha tricky cons and thieves either turnt tha trees or reformed with speedy hooves or feathered wings.” He gestured above his head. A hawk was making slow circles, coasting throughout the sky.

“Tha new prison reform,” the man continued, “that’s how it was all explained ta me.” He flipped through the disheveled papers on his clipboard–a list of names of prisoners and staff. “You were supposed ta git a phone call.”
