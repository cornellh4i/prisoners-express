"Girl On Bench" by John Naylon

So far away, but just the sight of her. My heart skips a beat. I am only in high school, but I look like a student on that Abilene Christian University campus. She resembles a rebel with her eyebrow piercing, athletic clothes, and strong build. Could she be like me? Would my afternoon smoke break scent from the park disarm her or drive her away? She acted as if she didn’t see me but I felt her taking it all in. Yet, she appeared practiced at such experiences and she feigned disinterest in this particular scene as if she were too cool to notice despite her mild nervousness. Holding to her beliefs yet so in touch with her flesh, I am enchanted by her.

Shortly, I see her again at the Wal-Mart near campus. She’s right behind me in line. It must be fate. If only I’d made recreational plans other than smoking today! I remember how my mother said my smell would drive a lot of girls away. If it would close the deal, being a drunk may have even been preferable in this situation. I would probably be around fifty or so when I pass my liver like some bad food from a buffet. Thoughts racing now. She was comfortable. Too comfortable. If I read her shirt would it say ACU? Or would it just be random? My heart is beating faster.

She knows. Somehow she knows. If I tried to read her shirt she would think I’m a creep who doesn’t care what her shirt says at all. The register beeps as mundane chatter continues from cashier to customer. **I’m in no state of mind for this*.* I finally decide to strike up a conversation about seeing her on campus. By some cheesy miracle I avoid saying, “So do you come here often?” Too quickly, the conversation ends in mild awkwardness.

When will I see her next? Hm. I feel like helicopters could be watching me all the way to the parking lot. It would have all been much easier if I knew more about her. But none of that now. Back to the Dakota to drive back to campus for my next adventure. I hook a right turn onto Ely, the cherry bombs roaring. Every frame of my life seems more and more like an outrageous scene from “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.” So, *what now? What comes next?*
