By Justin Kirk

I tell myself, when life gives you angels, make your own heaven.

And I did,

Once.

I can still see her eyes sparkling in the sunlight.

Her head resting gently on my shoulder.

And nothing else on earth exists to me.

Other prisoners are at them tables

The Arizona iced tea and the Reeses are still cold.

But only she exists to me.

Her wings are as white as her teeth.

Pearl.

The feathers are as soft as her blonde hair.

Dyed.

I can still smell her perfume on my pictures.

Her body snugly pressed against mine.

And nothing else on earth exists to me.

Other prisoners are at them tables.

The Arizona iced tea and Reeses are still cold.

But only she exists to me.

Her personality is one of a kind.

Perfection.

Her words inspired meâ€¦

Memories.

When life gives you angels, make your own heaven.

I can still hear her laughter when I close my eyes.

Imagination.
