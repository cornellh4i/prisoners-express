**"Breakfast" by Catherine LaFleur**

It is the 206th day of my confinement. There is no energy in my body to fight. I've been lying on the floor for five days. Just silent. I have not eaten for a while, too long. The pancakes are pushed through a slot in the door. Nothing is worth the moving, the consciousness, the pain. Probably why I feel weak. Thinking about these walls, that aren't really walls. The exit door next to my cell clangs open. Heavy footsteps leave the building. Soon a faint hint of black and mild slips through into my cell. Proves these walls are not so solid, not so sealed. It's just a figment of solid but I'm too dulled to see around. Through.

I am sleeping, sleeping, only this way can I be dead and not feel. The dark god of Gethsemane is quiet. Too quiet as he is perhaps dead with me. Imagine that my bones become smoke. If enough flesh melts away maybe my bones will disappear through the fine cracks into this cell wall. I will drift up and out of this prison into the sky and I will become the sky. Or something different. Something different.
