"She’s Just Waiting" by C Dias

She said she’d wait for him. Which for her meant for as long as her patience could allow. Yet, every once in awhile, she continues to dream and waits here on this bench. On any weekend her schedule permits, spending a few ideal hours with him is all she needs. Eventually her weary heart and mind find the needed strength to recommit to just waiting rather than focus on the duration of time left on his stint. She’s just waiting for the next opportunity to be out here on this bench.
