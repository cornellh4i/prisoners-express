**“I Can’t Hide” by Brother Boston**

Living a life of sin is all I’ve ever known. Nope, nope, wait--let me not lie. Living a life of sin is all I’ve ever done.

I don’t know when this called conscience came into my life and brought with it unwelcomed strife. Invading my personal space, it got all up in my face and blinding me like a light. Darkness was my friend since the beginning and I thought until the end, but some slick talker took my right hand in his and shook. With his left, he handed me a brown book.

He told me, “God Bless You, Son,” and before I knew it, he was...gone. Now, this happened on a day when I had some time to kill before my next dark deed, and so out of curiousity, I cracked the little brown book open and began to read.

There were books inside that little book with names like Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Why oh why did I ever open it? Didn’t they say curiosity killed the at? Lucky cat! That little book exposed my life and me, and I now know I’m a sinner devoid of light. Being scared I still can’t bring myself to change...my...conscience makes me feel shame…so I try to hide...from Him who created me...but I can’t. He is everywhere, even at my side. I can no longer hide in darkness because some slick talker gave me a little brown book that contains life. Be blessed, everyone!
