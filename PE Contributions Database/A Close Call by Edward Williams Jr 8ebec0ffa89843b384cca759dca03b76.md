**A Close Call by Edward Williams Jr.**

I know... I’m in prison for murder. But a certain close call prevented that one from becoming multiple.

After my mom died, I lost my way. I became a nihilistic atheist, one with nothing to live for. So I decided to kill myself. But before I could go, I wanted to kill my ex-girlfriend, too. Why? Because my heart was deathly lonely and she didn’t even know. Not her fault. Mine. But you’d be surprised how many people are hurt by others through no fault of their own.

I planned it. I set it up. I even convinced her to be alone at her house. But see the wisdom of God. Her best friend's mom got sick, causing her to come over to my ex-girlfriend's house. They were going to visit her mom in the hospital. And she brought some huge guy with her. And I’m no veritable Captain America. So I backed down and played it off. And she (at the time) never guessed a thing. Close call, huh?

Apparently God didn’t care if I was an atheist, he thwarted my evil plan all the same.

So what’s the moral of the story. The next time someone falls ill in your family, and you have to rush to see them, don’t ask, “why, God, why?” I tell you now, He could have just saved someone’s life.

Praise God.
