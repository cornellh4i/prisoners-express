**“Flying” by Paul Bero**

****I was in the U.S. Air Force (1966-70) and I have no idea how I became a jet mechanic. I wanted to be an office clerk! But I joined to serve, so I did my best.

I was stationed at K.I. Sawyer AFT, Michigan for two years, I was made a crew chief of a T-33A trainer jet, a small, sleek jet, used for training and to be “targets” for the fighter jets to locate and “shoot down.” For some reason all the pilots liked me, and whenever the back seat of my T-33A was without a co-pilot the pilot would tell me to go get a parachute and hop in for a ride if I wanted to go. Trust me! I went just about every time!

This one summer day things were a little different. We had been up in the sky, trying to avoid the radar of the fighters that were scrambled to shoot us down when all of a sudden the pilot says “Bero, I need you to sit up straight and pull your arms and legs in.” I was confused and asked “why?” The pilot told me to look at the instrument panel, the red light was flashing on and off that indicated our engine was on fire! If the pilot pulled his ejection handles, the canopy would blow off, then in ten seconds I would be ejected, then the pilot! They never sold “Depends” back then!

The pilot radioed an emergency and he had one of the fighters locate us quickly. In seconds, that seemed like weeks to me, a fighter pulled up behind us and that pilot indicated he could not see a fire in our engine compartment. The control tower ordered us to come back to base immediately. I felt better once the pilot in the fighter told us he could not see fire but I was still in the upright position, in case we had to eject.

You’d think I’d be happy as a lark when I saw our landing strip, but not so! It was then that I really panicked! All down the runway were ambulances and fire trucks, and my brain said “Oh crap! They know more than I do!”

Well God answers prayers don’t He? We landed without a problem!

Oh, the “engine is on fire” light? I opened up the engine compartment to find a loose wire that was causing the warning light to flash on and off.

The very next time one of the pilots asked me if I wanted to fly back seat I smiled and said “Yessssir!”

I loved those times!
