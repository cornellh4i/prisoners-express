**“Water Dragon” by Mark P. Sandfox**

****Nadine dragged her piggies to and fro across the glassy water. A tear dripped from her chin. The gnarly pier felt cold and empty, the whole world felt cold and empty. Not a single minnow nibbled at her floating bread crumbs. Not a breath of breeze rippled the waters. It was as if all life had ceased to exist. They hung her, hung her up like a gutted shark to be gawked at and weight.

That stupid girl, it was all her fault. She fell into the water, all on her own, would have drowned too, had Wendy not come along to save her. Then the stories started, monsters and magic. Nadine had told them all about Wendy, years ago and often since, but no one would believe her, told her it was nothing but her imagination. Wendy was not imaginary, she was not a monster either.

It was a day much like today, the waters calm, the mountain air breathless, bread crumbs floating around Nadine’s piggies, right on this very same pier. The minnows were nibbling, bobbing the bread crumbs down and away, when suddenly they all disappeared. Nadine pulled her piggies out from the water, folding her legs under her dress. Minnows nibbling at her toes kind of tickled, but bigger fish, the predators with their sharp teeth, that would hurt. But that day it was not a bigger fish that spooked the minnows, it was Wendy, not more than a foot long from tip of nose to tip of tail. Tiny little green scales, a rich green like the crinkly leaf of seaweed, covered her almost completely except for her dog-like head and bat-like wings, those were leathery and smooth. She had tiny little legs with sharp pointy claws, a stout little body, a long serpentine neck and a much longer tail, its tip broad like a triangle. Even her little buggy eyes were green, like elliptical emeralds. She was beautiful,

Wendy used her wings to propel herself through the water, gobbling up all the floating bread crumbs. It gave no mind whatsoever to Nadine atop the pier eagerly leaning forward with her feet tucked up under her dress. That was until there were no more bread crumbs left to be gobbled, then it whimpered like a small dog, her buggy elliptical eyes pleading with similar effect. It even yipped in a dragonish sort of way.

Earlier, Nadine had eaten half of her sandwich, tearing part of the other half into bread crumbs like she did most weekend mornings. Only the meat and half a slice of bread remained. Nadine held that morsel out in front of her.

“It’s all I have left but you are welcome to have it.”

The little dragon yipped and swirled in the water, its body staying just below the surface while its tiny little head and long preening neck danced above the surface, like a cormorant out for a swim. Nadine tossed the morsel, whole, into the air, just above its head. The cute little dragon burse forth out of the water, its jawn unhinging disproportionately wide, sharp needle-like teeth glistening in the morning sun, snatching the half sandwich whole out of the air, then torpedoed back under the water.

“Aw,” whined Nadine as the critter disappeared into the depths. It was so cute, Nadine wanted to play more.

It was Nadine’s turn to yip, not happily or begging, more shock and fear, when Wendy the Water Dragon burst out of the water, landing square in her lap. Nadine’s mouth fell agape. It took a moment to catch her breath, to catch her wits, but when she did, her hands could not resist petting those smooth slick scales. Narly instant, the little green dragon purred like a kitten, and so a friendship was born.

That was ten years ago. Nadine was only eight years old at the time. Now her life-long friend was hanging upside down atop a wharf in town. All because of some stupid girl who fell into the water, who was too stupid to learn how to swim, and intead of just sinking to the bottom of the lake, she splashed around frantically until Wendy, much bigger now, nearly twenty feet from head to tail, came along and scooped the stupid girl out of the water then laid her safely ashore.

The story spread quickly. Why they believed the stupid girl and never gave Nadine a second thought was beyond reason and just plain stupid, but believe her they did, and more stories morphed from there. From chickens and cattle stolen in the night, to fire-breathing mayhem of barn and house alike, even the snatching of little babies from their carriages when their mothers were not in sight. But Wendy had done none of that, she preferred deer and elk and the occasional moose, even rid the town dump of their bear problem over cold winter nights. She was gentle and kind, way fun to ride. Wendy could even humor Nadine with the occasional game of fetch. Clearly not the depraved evil monster these stories made her out to be.

And now she was gone, life snatched from her being, a friend snatched from Nadine. Another tear fell as Nadine dipped her big piggies into the cold empty waters.
