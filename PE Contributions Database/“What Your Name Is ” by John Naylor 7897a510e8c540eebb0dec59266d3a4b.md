**“What Your Name Is?” by John Naylor**

****Prison is a unique place. It’s a mixture of torture and really strange, illogical occurrences. Well, men get some real strange nicknames. Oddly, there’s usually a good reason for the origin of the nickname. Strange as they may be, they often have a backstory. Even if they don’t really seem like a good idea, at least to a white man.

So I was in Branchville Correctional Facility back in 2003. That’s in southern Indiana. Tell City is different from big cities. Most of southern Indiana was generally behind the times to a degree. We’re talking about ten years behind, especially before cell phones and the internet was everywhere. So you can expect some odd things when men from bigger cities mix with a lot of woods and rednecks in a block. Then mix in a lot of substance abuse. Well, for some reason there’s usually some real characters in prison and jail. Some real odd-looking dudes too.

We’re partying because it’s summer and just necessary. There’s this black dude with a super wide mouth and he looks real weird. So this wood starts talking about him. I start laughing so hard, I about pissed. The wood is like “What?”

I said, “You called him a catfish!” That was new to me.

He said, “No, I don’t mean ‘cause of his color. That’s what people call him. If you don’t believe me ask him.”

I’m laughing so hard it hurts. This guy is only missing some catfish whiskers. The wood is prodding me on like I’m calling him a liar. Which was even funnier, he’s throwing all kinds of non-P.C. terms out there. He won’t rest, so I’m like “OK, OK, I’ll go ask his nickname” which seemed super surreal. But if I do it respectfully he may not want to fight. So I’m like “Hey man, what do they call you?”

He says “Catfish.”

I’m going to ask - wait for it, wait for it - “Why do they call you that, man?”

He said, “Because I look like a catfish.”

I started dying. He looked like an animatronic catfish person. Like something out of a movie. I couldn’t believe it, he goes on defending the nickname. “I really do look like a catfish!” It was probably the funniest nickname moment of all my prison experiences. And the party marched on. The woods going on about how he owned up to looking like a catfish. Man, I wished I had it on video. Purely hilarious.
