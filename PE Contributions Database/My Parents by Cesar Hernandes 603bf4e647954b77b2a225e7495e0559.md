**My Parents by Cesar Hernandez**

Everyday I am grateful for my parents. Growing up I did not think I had great parents. I thought they fell in the middle of the pack. Now I realize that my parents are great and I could not ask for anyone better.

Growing up I was somewhat jealous of what other kids had. Now I realize that I had a whole lot more things than what many of my fellow inmates had growing up. My parents did their best and everyday I am grateful for the values they raised me with. I now realize that the reason I am is because my parents did their best to raise me.

There are a couple of things I felt my parents let me down. Compared to lots of my fellow inmates their parents let them down in every way.
