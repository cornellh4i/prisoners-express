**“Sisters Blood and Ghost” by Seth E**

The fact of my being adopted was always known to me, so I never felt betrayal or anger about this. In fact, I had no particular feelings about it, and was indifferent about the idea of finding my birth mother or other relatives. (At least until I did find them.)

But growing up, I was the only child of a couple who’d lost their first (and only natural) child in a tragic accident when she was only two years old. The fact that Linda - adoptive mother - has a chemical imbalance in her brain, which presented as what was then called “manic depressive disorder” (we call it “bipolar” now), meant that she had less than healthy ways of coping with her trauma. So, in a way, I was not an only child, but raised with the Ghost Sister, a perfect doll in the big oil painting in the living room, a perfect daughter I could never have measured up to.

Special occasions were marked by how Ghost Sister might have participated, how old she’d be, what she’d have been doing in life by then. She’d be 12, she’d be 13, she’d be getting her learner’s permit and Donald (adoptive dad) would be teaching her to drive, she’d be coming to see the fireworks with us, she’d be getting ready to graduate and looking at colleges… Ghost Sister was clearly an ideal child.

Me? I was the second goldfish. You know how parents try to soother little Timmy’s tears when Bubbles dies by bringing home a second goldfish? You know how Timmy doesn’t want another goldfish, he wants Bubbles? The same seems to be true with baby people, too. Maybe she never explicitly said as much, of course. But every wistful tear-soaked daydream about how old Cindy would be, how she would be doing in school, was like saying “ I don’t want another baby, I want Cindy.” So I lived with Ghost Sister, even though I was an “only child.”

But as Linda fantasized about Ghost Sister’s would-have-been life, I fantasized about Blood Sister. Somewhere out there was my truest friend, a sister to watch cartoons with, to ride bikes with, poke at bugs with, go to the library with, get into mischief with… We’d roam the world together, me and Blood Sister. I had as many fantasies about Blood Sister as Linda had about Ghost Sister.

Yet as I grew up, my fantasies of course never manifested, and I never bothered to find my birth/blood family, so Blood Sister faded from my daily life - though never completely. From time to time I’d still imagine what she might be like, what she would do for a living, her hobbies, and so on. We “lost touch” in a way, but not completely.

At 26 I had become close to my cousin, who turned out to also have been adopted (so my adopto-mom and her adopto-dad were brother and sister), and had found the process of meeting her blood relatives to be deeply meaningful and important and cathartic. She offered to do all the detective work for me, and I just said “sure, that’s cool - knock yourself out,” thinking it’d be nice to find my birth mother and family, but not too concerned. “No big deal.”

When my cousin told me, just the next day, that she’d spoken to my grandfather, and that my mother wanted to meet, my whole shifted. Suddenly it mattered, deeply, that I find out who these people are. The idea of simply going to a park the next day and seeing my actual blood mother… it took my breath away….

And when she said “and you have a sister, too!”... suddenly my breath came back. Like I hadn’t been breathing right my whole life until that moment. Blood Sister was real.

I have a knack for being complicated . Everything about me takes … explaining. My name, my education, my past, even my birth dates (dates plural). One of those complicated parts is my family. I was born in Upstate New York, but raised in Salt Lake City, Utah (kind of) and now I have double the normal relatives, like parents, grandparents, etc, as well as a Ghost Sister and a Blood Sister.

I don’t resent Ghost Sister (maybe Linda a bit), but I also can’t be entirely free of her - she was an all-permeating part of my childhood, Fortunately, I now have Blood Sister, who is my closest friend, my dearest ally. And when I finally get released, we’ll be eating sugary cereal while we watch old cartoons and then ride our bikes to go look for cool bugs. The love we have for each other isn’t diminished for our years apart, and she’s not “half” anything to me: Blood Sister is more than any of my youthful daydreams ever imagined.
