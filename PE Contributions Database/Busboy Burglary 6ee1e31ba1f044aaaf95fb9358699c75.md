***Busboy Burglary* by Curtis Colvin**

My first job was at a small restaurant in Deweyville, Texas. I can’t remember the name of the place, especially since it’s been closed for many years.

I was 13 years old, and my mom allowed me to work there. My job was to bus tables, mop, sweep, and clean. At least I didn’t have to wash dishes. I enjoyed it and learned many lessons from the work experience. Most of all, how to get fired.

At the counter where the register was, there were little standup cardboard advertisements which were selling the products attached to them by rubber band. One was for pocket knives and another for these cheap birthstone rings. Even the knives were cheap. Remember this was 1976.

Well, I was caught taking a knife and a few rings. I even think there might have been a pair of sunglasses… My first job--FIRED--just like that. The worst part was telling my mom, and boy, was she disappointed in me. I could never go back to that restaurant, which was bad because it was the only one in that small town. Lesson learned.
