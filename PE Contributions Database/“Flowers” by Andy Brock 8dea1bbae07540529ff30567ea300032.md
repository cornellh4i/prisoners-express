**“Flowers” by Andy Brock**

When I was young flowers were the first thing that told me that warmer weather is on its way. Where I grew up in the foothills of South Carolina, the smells that came with flowers were the best time of the year. Even out of all the peach, apple, plum, and all other trees that bloom. Gave off a mixture of smells that was out of this world.

But now I sit here in this cell. Thinking of the past gone by, wishing I could see and smell all that again. Here where I am all you see is the little dandy lions. You see them one day and the next day all you see is cut grass and pieces of them.

Now and then they will plant all kinds of flowers around the building. That close gives off a little smell that takes me back to the part of my childhood. I am glad that I can remember those smells of the flowers of my younger life. Sometimes I will sneak some flowers into my cell, just to give it a fresh smell. And the memory of the freedom I used to have.
