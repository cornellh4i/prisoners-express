**"Yearning For Need" by Dexter Rabadan**

Birds, trees, and waterfalls all came out of his cell. A jungle of imagination, a utopia of escape. He would flip through the pages of National Geographic, gyros of Greece, fracking in Oklahoma. This fantasy pushed the reality of the cell walls further and further away.

Coffee, Good Morning America; he had not drank coffee nor did he watch GMA until he came to prison. Calm, humiliated, on the streets; he was prideful and turbulent. He had let prison change him, strip him, control him.

The only relationships he sustained were with literature. Zola never complained. Steinbeck never talked back to him. Through literature, the world ceased for him; he controlled this fictional world. If he wanted birds, there would be birds. In this fictional world, a raucous of happenings occurred, but in reality, he lived a quiet uneventful life.

Years and years of solitary confinement had left him with a slight hunchback. He would slowly hobble back and forth from the toilet to the bunk, anxious to return to his shows.

Many visitors; preachers, lawyers, and so on; had walked the tiers over the years with the false promise of hope: “You will be saved!” or “You will be released!” and so on.

Today, a non-profit organization dealing with families of prisoners were to walk the tiers of the shu; this did not interest him. There was a quiet hush on the tier, as always. The occasional flush of a toilet could be heard.

The rotunda door slowly slid open. In came two women and a man. He did not see them; the TV had his full attention. They walked from cell to cell talking to the inmates. Quick disengaged conversations.

Three cells down, he heard the cry through his perforated plexiglass covered door. It was a small cry as a mew of a kitten, small lungs belting forth disagreement, yearning for milk, for need.

He was clad in gray thermal bottoms and top. He slouched to the door. The source of the cries was warmly bundled up in the young lady’s arms, it’s closed eyes and rosy cheeks barely visible beneath a small baby blue beanie. A boy.

The baby clenched his tiny fists and wailed. The baby’s small mighty cries climbed the walls, up the high ceiling, and into his cell; up his spine, beneath his bones, and into his heart. He was entranced.

He thought of his first lover, succumbing to passion. He remembered his father coming home from working in the orange fields, too tired to talk, too tired so he slept. He remembered walking downtown seeing a man standing in the uppermost window of the Radisson barefooted, curtains flapping in the breeze; the fire department below telling the man not to jump. His mother had told him to close his eyes. The man had jumped. He did not close his eyes.

But he did not remember the last time he heard a baby cry. The cries cocooned him in reverberating chills. Mind, body, and soul were moved.

He was on his knees, hands outstretched above his head. “My God!” he said. “My God, my God!” He had not heard a baby cry in thirty-seven years. Beneath the chest, beneath the ribs, came forth a deep guttural cry. His and the baby’s cries mingled into a pleading for their needs; salvation and milk, always milk. He had not cried in thirty-seven years.
