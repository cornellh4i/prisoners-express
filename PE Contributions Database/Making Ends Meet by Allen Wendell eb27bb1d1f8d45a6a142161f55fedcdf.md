**Making Ends Meet by Allen Wendell**

I’ve been locked up for 15 years now. My whole adult life has been behind bars (I’ll be 35 years old this October). Yes, I’ve had my own things and I was well equipped and aware of responsibilities before I was incarcerated, but I think that I’ve been the true definition of making ends meet. This long journey has been a real critical testament to my patience and understanding about life and budgeting. At times, I’ve had hundreds of dollars on my books, and at times I’ve had less then $50.00, but somehow during these years, I’ve learned how to make my priorities a priority, because the next receipt wasn’t always promised. Thankfully, I’ve been able to eat a meal just about every night of my bid and my hygiene items have been well above what is expected. At times it could’ve been a plain soup (noodles) and some days I had to go to sleep because I was so full, but now, I try to help my family and friends as much as possible. Teaching them how living from check to check isn’t always healthy.

Planning and budgeting is always the key. At times we tend to push our priorities to the backseat and we make momentary items and materialistic things our importance, but we still have rent, car payments, insurance, etc, to pay. When those things should’ve been our priority from the start.

Whenever I receive any money from my family and friends, I plan it down to the last penny on how it’s going to get spent and how not to allow my temptations with buying music and sweet items to stand in my way and sidetrack me from what’s important. Making ends meet is more of an understanding and not just a phrase that we use when we’re ahead on our bills. It’s the struggle to not struggle if you know what I mean…

Well, I hope that my words were able to help you in some shape or form. I wish you all the best.
