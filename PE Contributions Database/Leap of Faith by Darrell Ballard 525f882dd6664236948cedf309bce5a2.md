Most people think of this as a daring stunt or an act without thinking, but my story is of another kind. When I was 9 years old, I was sent to a home for kids with nowhere to go. The home was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a place I had never been to before. I was sent here because D.H.S. took me away from my family due to abusive, parenting conflicts. Plus 8 different foster families took me in and spit me back out. They stated that they were unable to handle me due to the fact that I was too violent.

So a couple months into my stay, I ended up meeting this woman named Nancy. She was nice to all the kids, but our relationship seemed to run deeper than most. Our friendship got better and better until one night, I blurted out, “Will you be my mommy?” I was immediately embarrassed at how easily I let my guard down. Let’s just say that things changed after that. Nancy ended up leaving her job and becoming my volunteer.

I was at home until I was 11, and then I was sent to another foster family. I thought I was to never see Nancy again, but sure enough, one day, she showed up and took me to her parents’ home to celebrate my first Christmas with a family. One year later, I was moving into a brand new house that was just built. I was part of a new family, Nancy’s family.

Sure, you could say that I took a leap of faith by asking her to be my mother. My mother, on the other hand, was only 27 and saw past the pain, sorrow, and hatred in a little boy--and saw the good. She told me that she knew it would be stormy waters, but she did it anyway.

Now, 14 years later, she’s still my mother. No matter how many times I tried to push her away, no matter how many times I’ve been in trouble with the law, she still stood strong. She is the true definition of a leap of faith.
