**“Helping Out” By David E. Williams**

I don’t pay too much attention to what can be considered to be “helping out”. I guess I just do. It is a subconscious type of reaction with me and I am not aware of it until someone says, “thank you” or gives me a “thumbs up.” It seems that “helping out” in situations can not only be rewarding, but contagious. It feels good when someone says “thank you” because you were able to help out. It also seems like when you are least expecting it, someone winds up helping you out.

“Helping out” seems to have its own “balancing act” when it is done without looking for something in return. Give it a try.
