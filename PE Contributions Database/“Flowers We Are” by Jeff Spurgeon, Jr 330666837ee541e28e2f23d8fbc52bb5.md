**“Flowers We Are” by Jeff Spurgeon, Jr.**

Who would’ve known that on May 25th, 2005, only eighteen years old, my life would change in the “blink of an eye.” It was as if I came twirling down and landed in a bed of nasty, smelly weeds and vines of all sorts. I was sentenced to thirty-five years in prison followed by life on probation. There was no way doves were going to allow this raven to nest in their field of “flowers.”

But, after entering the prison system at nineteen years old, something in my mind began “emerging from the fog” of thoughts that always drove me mad. The truth, the reality of responsibility, understanding, all started partying in my mind like they were having a “wedding.”

I started accepting responsibility for my own actions. I was convicted of second degree murder, and I developed the same mindset as most other prisoners: “Who do these people think they are, taking my life away from me!” Then it hit me: “Who the hell do I think I am to think I am to believe I can just go around robbing, stealing, breaking into homes, killing, and hurting people! Who am I to claim my rights when I was stealing others.”

What makes me think I deserve this or that, but others don’t. I’m not better than anyone. I can go around violating others but as soon as someone does it to me it’s wrong. They have no right. There’s laws they have to follow. Then it hit me– there’s laws I have to follow, too. And instantly it hit me, and it was as if there was “magic in the air.”

I started educating myself. Studying different religions and faiths. Going through history books learning all about our “ancestors” and the ones who lived, built, and died for this country. I’m sure our “ancestors” are rolling around in their grave when they look down on us and see they shed blood for no reason. Not just their own blood, but the blood of so many.

We want it all. Why, because our “jealousy,” because we covet what others have. We want to be the best, have the best, or look the best. Where does this all stem from? Where do we get this mindset that leads us to a life of evil against others? Prideful, egotistic beasts and monsters.

How do we heal this growing disease? What helped me is taking responsibility for my own actions. Don't blame mom or pops; don’t blame God or the devil; don’t blame cops or the judge; friends or enemies. You did this, whatever has got you on a downward path to destruction is your own choice. Nobody is forcing you or forced you to shoot, rob, rape, etc.

The cops, judge, devil, they did not make you do it. So they gave you too much time, boo-hoo! Stop crying about it and go get in the law books. Educate yourself. I was eighteen years old when I caught my charge and now I’m thirty-one.

My public defender tricked me into accepting an open plea to second degree murder. He told me that if I accepted the plea I wouldn’t get any more than twelve years in prison. Well, I’ve been incarcerated for thirteen years now. I wasted a lot of years blaming others.

I am guilty of no more than manslaughter, which carries a maximum of fifteen years in prison here in Florida. I can’t change my situation by complaining and taking it out on others. What is sad is most of you will get out and continue to break the law because it’s okay for you to do it, but nobody else is allowed.

Think about your thoughts and change your thought patterns. You're not the only one going through shit. Look at this idea: we all have done so much (you, me, our accusers), and it’s not a new thing under the sun, someone else has done it, is doing it, and will do it.

Don’t blame where you’ve been, or what you've been through, stop blaming your messed up childhood, other people have, are, and will walk that exact same path. The only thing that truly matters now, right here, today, this very moment, is what are you willing to do, and what are you going to do in the future.

Stop feeling bad for yourself, you’re not a baby who needs your diaper changed or a bottle, so nobody is going to come running. They say the quickest way to the top is to get off your bottom. Don’t take it out on others, I can tell you from experience it will only dig a deeper hole.

Do the right thing. Make the right choices. Break that cycle around you and claim success in your life. You don’t need to believe in anything or anyone else, just believe in yourself and all things will be possible.

You are only poor to a richer person, but you are richer than a poorer person. You are ugly, fat, skinny, etc. only to someone who is opposite to you. I guarantee that a lot of people think you are so ugly, but I can guarantee there are just as many people who think you’re handsome, beautiful, sexy, etc.

You are fatter than a lot, but skinnier than many. If you are one of those people who is called ugly, ugly first of all is in the heart and mind of the holder. Who gets to pick who’s ugly, skinny, fat, etc. Does Hollywood get to make that choice for the entire world? Yes, only because we let them.

If someone calls you stupid think of something you’re really good at and challenge that person’s knowledge to what you know. If someone calls you ugly, agree with them because we are all uglier than somebody, but we all are more beautiful than somebody.

A girl called me ugly one time. I asked what her boyfriend looked like, she didn’t have one. No wonder! Now she was a beautiful girl, I can’t steal that from her, but I shot back you have no boyfriend and Selena Gomez is 10,000 times prettier than you. Of course I apologized and I just wanted her to see how it felt to be looked down on.

All I’m saying is you’re a “flower,” so grow where you are planted. You will be as beautiful as you allow yourself to be inside and out.
