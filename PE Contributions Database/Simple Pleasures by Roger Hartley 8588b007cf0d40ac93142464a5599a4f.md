**"Simple Pleasures" by Roger Hartley**

How those of us in prison learn what truly they are! To be able to hold your loved one's hand on a nice sunny day. To be able to watch the sun set. To be able to walk out your door and visit anyone you wish. To be able to buy yourself a coke at the store. To be able to enjoy the waves of summer or to be able to walk in the mountains. To be able to play with your children. To be able to sing in the rain if you wish. The very day simple little pleasures toy don't think about when your doing whatever got us in here, we do wish we had back! There is so many, but we no longer get to enjoy them, and really will never be allowed to! How is it some say we are not punished enough when no one thinks about the simple pleasures we no longer get to enjoy! Oh how I hope for simple pleasures again!
