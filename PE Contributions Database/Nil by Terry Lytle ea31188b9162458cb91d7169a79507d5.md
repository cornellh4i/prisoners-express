**“Nil” by Terry Little**

If I choked on my Rage - it’s still, my hands!

Bound and tied - held back by the predator at bay....

There’s no “solution”... Life’s not like that… A predator is never, “at bay”

For the Rage is a centrifugal force, self contained

At the will of my own mind… There’s nothing hindered… There’s

Nothing “held back”... It is only, my desire to not hurt, to not kill

To not cause pain…

Like double sashes of silk: binding… Yet, forbidden…

For who can bit the experience of survival… cancel-out,

Self-preservation…

Not even the wolf-narrative, can silence the kill, of, living

Only Pessimism in an optimistic world is more choking…

Rage…

Hands…

Killing…

Such is the cipher, of nil...
