**"Peer Pressure" by Daniel Alvarez**

Peer pressure is a real thing. In fact, a lot of us commit it without even knowing it. When we dare someone to do something, when we ask a friend to go to a party with us, it might be as simple as asking a friend to do something with us. We feel we are encouraging someone, yet we may be enabling and leading them down the wrong path. I myself would be a different person if I didn’t give in to peer pressure. So how do we interact with friends? When interacting with them, will they take us into adventure that we should not undertake? In high school, I did my sophomore year without stopping to talk to anyone in the hallway, and I did not interact with friends after or during school. I came to the seventeenth place for valedictorian. It’s weird, but there are very few friends in my life that are completely positive influences in my life. So I feel as if my friends hold me back. How do I deal with the pragmatics of that? Need I remind you of an old saying: “it’s not what you know, but who you know.” So I recommend that you find friends with good virtues and avoid those who have vices, have bad habits and are uncultured. Remember I feel that we are unaware of when we commit peer pressure, and furthermore, we are usually unaware when we are the victims of peer pressure. Nobody’s perfect, and that makes it even harder to find someone with just good virtues. So we must look within ourselves to know what we are not willing to do, and have more self-control, and practice temperance. We must realize that vices come with consequences. Some of them long term. They may affect the way we learn. And all because we fall victim to simple peer pressure. So I say we must have an understanding of what is good, and be aware of what is bad. We must seek out the good and avoid the bad. Pragmatics is a heavy topic because opinions vary. Yet virtues are of the just, and vices are for the unjust.
