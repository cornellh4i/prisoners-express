Out on a camping trip out west, I saw the dog. He was all black, but his stomach was white. I kept on walking through the mountains in front, and to the left, about 30 yards away, was the same dog. How is the dog stalking me? Walked another 6 hours then about 70 yards was the black dog. It’s getting dark in the middle of nowhere, and I got a dog hunting me. His eyes, they are hazel green but glowing, and you can see the strength all through this dog but his eyes.

So let me set up camp. Need to make some coffee because maybe the dog isn’t real. I made a fire and hot water. While the darkness fell fast, it was cold but the coffee warmed me up. I kept looking at the eyes. I tried to sleep but that dog…

Strong and alone

Bottom of paws are cold

Looking for food

Looking for shelter

Hate this time of the year

Food is so hard to find

Streams are frozen

No water,

Got to eat snow for water

At night crying feeling like I was frozen

Hide in they house nobody could find

Survival you see in this stare
