**“Living for the Moment” by Calvin Westerfield**

Nature is really beautiful. To look at places on the Earth that have not been disturbed by the destructive hands of mankind is peaceful. The damage people have done to this planet so far is already causing so many changes to the environment, yet we continue to dig and build as if the Law of Causation do not apply to us.

CNN and other news stations are always reporting on big oil spills that poison aquatic life and on nuclear explosions that release toxic radiation into the atmosphere. They also talk of the coal we burn, the trees we cut down, and the natural resources we constantly take from the Earth; nature is starting to complain.

Sport hunting is something I’ve never understood either. To kill an animal and not eat it just seems wrong. What’s the big deal about anyway? Here in Baraga, Michigan, these people call this “God’s country” which means it’s prime hunting land. You should hear all the correctional officers talk of their hunting plans: go out and whack a few bucks and black bears. What bragging rights do you have for hiding in a tree, luring an animal in, and shooting it from a very safe distance, just to leave it there?

That’s not being in tune with nature. Our ancestors who were very skillful hunter-gatherers did not waste like this. In this day and age, we seem to be just living for the moment.

Think how dreadful things will be for humanity in 200 years from now if we keep degrading our home. Even animals know not to shit where they sleep! I wonder how a picture of this exact mountain and its surrounds will look in the year 2216? I hope for humanity’s sake that it will wisen up. The universe always corrects itself.
