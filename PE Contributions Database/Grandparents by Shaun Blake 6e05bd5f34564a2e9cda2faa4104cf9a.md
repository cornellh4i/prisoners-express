I never knew my paternal grandfather and neither did my father. He left my grandmother at a dance, jealous and drunk, when she was 6 months pregnant. His name was Charles Orville Blake.

My paternal grandmother was a nice but strict lady. When I asked her about Grandpa Blake, she got this nasty puckered, fish-like look on her face and said, “I don’t talk about that drunken bastard. The last time I saw him was at the 1932 Ogden City 4th of July parade. I felt your dad’s stroller move. Looking over, I saw Charles squatting next to your father, patting his head and saying hi. I pushed Charles in the gutter and told him to get away from my son before I called the police. The damned bastard anyway!” This was the only story she ever told me about him. Within two years, she married another man and had two more sons with him. He died when my father was about 15 or 16 years old. I never knew him either. Grandma stayed widowed for around 30 years until around 1975.

One day, she showed up at our house alone, which was very unusual. She had never learned to drive, but was so traditional that she rode a public bus from Ogden to Clearfield (about 30 miles), then walked over 10 miles to where we lived in Syracuse (UT), just to ask my dad for permission to get married again. Amazing! Well, of course she did. If my dad had said no, I have no doubts she wouldn’t have married old Ed. But she did and he died sometime in the 90’s. After that, she lived alone until 2002 when my mom and dad tricked her into living in a small apartment that my dad had converted to from the garage.

She had Alzheimer’s Disease and couldn’t live alone anymore. Dad would never allow her in an old-folks’ home. She died in 2010, not long before she turned 100 years old. She left behind three sons, fifteen grandchildren, over thirty great-grandchildren, and over twenty great-great-grandchildren. She was the only grandparent I really knew. Her name was Ethal Leona Wilson-Blake-Hadlock-Nesbitt. I love and miss her. I know my actions hurt her and I wish I could have been a better grandson.

My maternal grandfather was a big, outgoing man with enough energy to fill a power plant. He was a surveyor and mining engineer and was the official Idaho state mining inspector for many years. I remember going to the state capitol building to see him sometimes. He would take us with him on his projects, showing us how to use his equipment. He also taught us how to fish and camp outdoors in the mountains. He loved to cook and bake. He taught my next oldest sister and I how to make peanut brittle, fudge, suckers, divinity, penoche… and the hardest was saltwater taffy (at least for 10 and 12 year olds). It’s so tiring to “pull” the taffy as it would never quite come out right: a light tan, hard as rock candy that tasted like hardened powdered sugar, butter and vanilla. We always ate it though. His name was Othello Tanner Hansen, and he died in 1980. My parents almost named me after him, but didn’t obviously. I feel now that I would have liked that. “O.T. Blake,” hmm?

My maternal grandmother was a school teacher. She was a lovely, nice lady. I don’t remember her when she was a functioning person though. By the time I started to recollect memories, she was already sick. She was in a car wreck and it caused a “hardening of the arteries” in her brain which caused Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, and her mind regressed into a childlike state, which worsened until she died. My dad wouldn’t allow her to be put in an old-folks’ home either. The story goes: she asked him to promise to never put her in a home. This was before she lost her faculties. She lived with us when she died in 1981. I was 13 years old and she was around 76 years old. Her name was Margaret Louise Hadfield Pratt-Hansen. I wish I could have known the real her.
