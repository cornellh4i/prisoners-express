***Who Gives you the Right?* by Lucio Shadow Urenda**

It’s 6:00 AM in the morning. I’ve managed to crawl up hill going against the wind.. I’ve got my cammo on. I’m glassing down hill to spot any kind of movement.. I’m glassing with the scope on my rifle.. Waiting to tag my next kill.. I never expected to confront a species so demanding. As I have done this morning.. For when I see him come out the shadows slowly making his way across a field. He stops.. I got my scope & crosshairs on him.. But I can feel his demand.. For his eyes are full of inquiry. “What gives you the right?” His eyes demand.. “To pull your trigger??” “What wrong must I pay for??” “What evil have I done to you?” His eyes scream out.. “I hunt to live to sustain my life and that of my pack.” “I am as the creator has intended me to be!!” His soundless eyes exclaim “I am life just like you I started out as a pup like you did..” “Who gave you the right to snuff out a life with the squeeze of a trigger??” His eyes Demand. I slowly lower the rifle and smile. And out to the open I yelled out to him.. “No one!!” He flicks his ears, looks back the way he came. Out of the shadows four other heads pop up, Two as big as him and two other smaller ones.. He turns to stare at me. For a few seconds.. I say.. “Go on; do what you were created to do old one.” His pack joins him and they cross the field together..
