**Sisters by Cesar Hernandez**

My cousin Erica runs away from home at the age of five. Erica is completely happy for three years being an only child. Erdine comes along and ruins everything. Erica does not like having a little sister.

Erica’s lifestyle is completely altered. Now the baby gets all the attention. When they get in trouble, Erica gets in more trouble since she’s the oldest.

The final straw is when Erica finds out that kids do not go to sleep at 5PM. Erica is at Suzie’s house down the street. Suzie has an 8PM bedtime. Erica demands a later bedtime. She is rebuffed. Erica and Erdine will keep their 5PM bedtime.

She tells mom she is running away if she does not get an 8PM bedtime. Ellen asks Erica if she’s running away to grandma Elspeth? Erica stays quiet since that is her plan.

Erica goes upstairs to pack. She fills her Barbie suitcase with the essentials. Books, since she reads a lot. Dolls, so she will have toys to play with. After packing the essentials, there is no room for clothes. She sits on top of the suitcase and struggles to close her suitcase.

Erica puts on several pairs of underwear, two shorts, two pants. She puts on several shirts, a sweater, and a raincoat. She walks out the door without even saying goodbye to Ellen.

Grandma’s apartment is one mile away. Erica is so determined to get to grandma Elspeth that she does not see Ellen twenty feet behind her following her.

Erica’s suitcase does not have wheels so she mostly drags it down the sidewalk. It’s also summer so she is sweating profusely from all the clothes she is wearing.

She finally gets to grandma’s. Before she even knocks, the door opens. Elspeth says Erica can’t live there but she is welcome to come in for milk and cookies.

Ellen walks in. Erica tells mom that Erdine is ruining her life. Mom says she has no idea that’s how Erica feels. If Erdine is such a burden, they can send her to the orphanage. Erica reads a lot so she knows what an orphanage is.

Erica says she wants to keep Erdine even if that means going to bed at 5PM. Erica constantly reminds Erdine that she could have sent her to the orphanage but instead kept Erdine.
