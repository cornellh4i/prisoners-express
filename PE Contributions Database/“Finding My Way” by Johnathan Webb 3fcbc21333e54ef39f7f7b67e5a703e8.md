**“Finding My Way” by Johnathan Webb**

Looking down on me in the city’s gutter

Where I look to find these broken pieces of myself

Each describes a part of me I can barely utter

One’s for this girl and lots for girls that make me melt

Some of these fragments are for substances I seek

And also intoxicating drinks and dark bars

Struggling to make this a life I can keep

And, the pieces that reflect all of my scars

Shattered pieces lay like so many slivers

In this lies my short-lived companionships and terrible pains

Sorrows that are also oceans at the end of troubled rivers

And a special piece a passion for when it rains

Looking down not giving up on me finding me in amazing cities

She urges me into deeper soil and decay

In her dark love, I find warmth I’m high and my minds misty

The Devil keeps urging me from on high showing me the way
