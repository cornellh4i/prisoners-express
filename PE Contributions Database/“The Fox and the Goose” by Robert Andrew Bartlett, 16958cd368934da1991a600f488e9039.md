**“The Fox and the Goose” by Robert Andrew Bartlett, Sr.** 

Brer Fox complained a lot; but really this was the best job he’s ever had. Sure, it was a bit humiliating, catering to a silly goose. And a fat, sick one at that! Some of the animals laughed at him, but that was O.K. They didn’t know that he’d gleefully eaten many of their parents and grandparents. Tomorrow or the next day, if all went according to plan, he’d eat some of their children. But tonight - tonight he and the missus and all their kits would have a feast to remember!

So he pushed the fat slob around the barnyard in that silly baby buggy. The big bird prattled on and on about nothing. Brer Fox nodded his head once in a while to look like he was listening. He hummed a tune he’d heard a human sing once - a woman called Odetta:

Fox went out one chilly night,

Prayed for the moon to give him light,

For he’d many a mile to go that night

Before he’d reach the town-o…

The goose prattled on and on. Even as vain and narcissistic as he was, he didn’t understand the humans’ sudden interest in him. He must have done something they considered quite heroic. All of a sudden, Farmer BRown started feeding him generous portions of his favorite foods!

He’d quickly gained three pounds! He felt guilty and tried to skip a meal. There were thousands of starving chicks in the world. If the humans had that much extra food, why didn’t they give some of it to Chicken Little or Turkey Lurkey?

He hadn’t meant to hurt anyone’s feelings, but he guessed he had. Farmer Brown ran a tube down his gullet and force fed him some kind of awful gruel. He wouldn’t make that mistake again.

He’d resumed eating and gained another four pounds. He didn’t feel good. 	“Are my eyes yellow?” he asked. Brer Fox wasn’t listening, but he thought he heard an interrogatory inflection, so he dutifully nodded his head.

“Oh dear!” the poor, distraught bird moaned. “I hope there’s nothing wrong with my liver!”

“Oh silly goose, there’s nothing wrong with your liver at all!” Brer Fox mused. He thought of the pate de foie gras that he and the missus would enjoy that night, the kits gorging themselves on legs, drumsticks, and wings. On the morrow, there’d be breasts and stew meat, and he’d steal some fresh eggs from the henhouse. The missus would be very happy. And when Missus Fox was happy…

Pushing a baby buggy required a fox to be in a very undignified position. Brer Fox’s swelling member was almost in the old goose’s face. How awkward! He hummed a little louder and concentrated on a couple of verses of his own he’d been working on.

The goose ate corn and the fox drank liquor.

The goose got fatter, and they both got sicker.

He flapped his wings but he’d have to be quicker

To leave this farm alive-o.

‘Live-o, Live ooh!’

He flapped and flapped but he’d have to be quicker

To leave this town alive.

A bell rang. “We’d better turn around” the goose said. “Mrs. Brown is sounding the dinner bell”.

Brer Fox nodded absently. He knew where he was going...to a certain part of the fence behind the wooden shed.

Raging winds make candles flicker.

Rains came down and the roads got slicker.

Old goose rode in the finest wicker;

The Foxes paid the fare-o…
