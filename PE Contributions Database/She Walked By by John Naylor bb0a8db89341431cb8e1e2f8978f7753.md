**“She Walked By” by John Naylor**

I’ll never forget her from the English class. Shannon, she must’ve been something where she came from. Real popular, she walked as she had it because you could tell she knew she did. She walked up between the tables of every college English class to the front. You could almost swear every time. Like you were repairing something and it broke in the process of repair. After the sexual frustration passed, you couldn’t help but wonder what’s with the “walking friends”. Like every end of the class there was a re-enactment of clueless. And it was guys, and they came across a little bisexual at least. What the hell? Maybe she was too… No way, too much lipstick and too concerned for public opinion. Just enough of a fleeting thought to imagine her in a scene from one of those “real good memories”, as Rodney Carrington worded it. Then who’d co-star? Cough syrup got me leaning over in my mind. Why were there no country songs about syrup? Smooth drawl like it’s poured over some hot pancakes. Maybe in time. It would surely come out of a studio around Houston.

But it was enough of that now. After some obvious cool conjecture on proper sentences, there was another hard thing to deal with: watching the little 18 or 19 year old Shannon come by my seat with a smile. “Have to see her go but love to watch her leave.” He was right. “Brother, she’s all country.”
