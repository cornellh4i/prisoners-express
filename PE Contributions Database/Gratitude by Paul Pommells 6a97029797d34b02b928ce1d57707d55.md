**Gratitude By Paul Pommells**

I am grateful for all of my teachers.

I was fortunate to have many good ones.

They told me that I had potential

And they tried to inspire me to see what they saw in me.

I am grateful for the love

of my family. My family may be broken

And my extended relations may be

Dysfunctional, but they love me.

I am particularly grateful for

Second chances and all of the opportunities

That lie before me I am grateful

For the love of the creator and all of

the gifts he has given me. Having

All of that gratitude makes it easy

for me to smile and sport a good

Attitude everyday.
