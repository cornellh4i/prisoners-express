**By Marcello Gibbs**

Have you ever had that feeling of excitement with your adrenaline rushing

Girls wearing bikinis smiling and blushing

Spring break with vacation In the tropics

“Beach parties everywhere!” that’s the trending topic

Fiending like an addict when they need that fix

Girls doing whatever just to be in the mix

Club scenes jumping, drinks in the V.I.P

College girls getting wild like PG-13

It always happen around this time and season

Everybody gets Spring Fever for no apparent reason

This Is the time when everything starts to bloom

Girls wearing dresses like it’s a showroom

The sun is dancing off different faces

Its radiance shines in multiple places

There is nothing more amazing than the Springtime

Especially when the sun set around noon time

I think the birds even get Spring Fever

This is what I imagine as a perceiver

Nothing Is more beautiful and alive than Spring

Joy and happiness Is what It brings

Spring Is a representation of new life

When everything is reincarnated bringing true-life

Everything giving birth

While Spring Fever spreads across the earth

Spring Fever is my type of illness
