**“Helping Hand” by Jen Crow**

During my first incarceration, I learned to be ok with being alone. So, for me to take off, on my motorcycle (Beauty) alone, is not uncommon. Beauty is pearl white with pink and gray flames. She has a beautiful cross on the gas tank. I’ve been told that I match her because I am beautiful too. Some days I believe this and on other days, I feel far from pretty.

One particularly hot summer day left me feeling like my life had come unraveled. Nothing could make me feel better than some wind therapy on Beauty. I had baked a cake that morning and decided to take some with me. I have some elderly friends that enjoy my home-baked surprises. I stashed my credit card and license in my back pocket. I never carry a wallet when I ride, so I grabbed a couple handfuls of quarters and put into my saddle bags along with the cake.

While riding, I decided a cold margarita, chips and salsa would hit the spot. I parked in front of La Huerta’s and headed inside. I noticed a homeless lady sitting on the concrete in the hot sun. Her face was lined and leather-looking. She shielded her eyes from the sun and looked at me with a big toothless grin. She asked for some change, and all I had in my pocket was my credit card. I told her I didn’t, but when I come out, I would.

I sat at the bar, thinking about my life. The lady outside kept popping into my mind. Maybe, my day wasn’t so bad after all. Did she have any family? Did she have anywhere to go? Was she really hungry? I wondered what her name was. It was suddenly very important that I know her name. I paid my bill and headed out the door. There, she sat in the hot sun. She was leaning against the wall.

“Do you like cake?” I asked her.

She looked slightly confused when she answered, “Yes, I do.”

“I have something for you.” I grabbed the cake and the quarters from my motorcycle. I then sat down beside her and handed it all to her. I asked for her name, and she told me it was Allison. I told her that I had been hailing from a really bad day, but thanks to her, that had all changed. I told her if more people would focus on what they do have instead of what they don’t, the world would be a much better place. She just grinned and took another bite of cake.

I don’t think Allison will ever know how much she touched my heart that day. I thanked her for helping me to see that my day wasn’t so bad after all. There were tears streaming down my face as we leaned together for a selfie. I’ll never forget her. I wonder if she had any cake lately?

Never pass up a chance to lend a helping hand. You might get more than you bargained for like I did!
