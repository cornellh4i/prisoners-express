I am the FFoal: Faith Fulfilled Of All Living, and I have lived up to this name by being set free from 3 addictions and also a porn obsession. After I was freed, I was sealed, and that is the only reward I *need*, but I *want* to set others free and can start with your help through peace.

What is a nickname? The nickname is usually an omen of your future, and this can be verified by a survey of history, i.e. the 27 Club that consists of Jimi, Amy, Kim, Brian, etc.

So now I am living up to my precious and fabulous name and am looking to exhort and encourage other addicts to be free by growth in knowledge and love of God before itâ€™s too late.
