**"A Mother’s Love" by Curtis Colvin**

In this picture, I see love and sadness. Even though you cannot tell, I know this woman is crying and in pain for the loss of a loved one. Whether it be a husband or son, she mourns deeply for the loss.

I wonder, in today’s society, why we have to kill one another in the name of “God”? Why do we have to show hatred towards our neighbor and fellow man? Is it so wrong to be different in looks and beliefs?

I believe the only way we will be united and have all this hatred be stomped out is when the Second Coming of Christ arrives. I hate to say it that way because I don’t believe we all, as a world, will come together in love and unity without His help.

But I will say this: after He comes, there will not be any scenes like the picture I’m writing about. Praise Jesus!
