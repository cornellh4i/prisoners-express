**“Picture Theme” by Cesar Hernandez**

The happiness that most people pursue is just like holding sand: the tighter they hold It, the quicker it leaks away, and in the end they find their joy was more dust. Wouldn’t it be better to try your best, avoid dwelling on things, and let causes and conditions determine the extent of your success?

Once, a painter drew a dot on a blank piece of paper, had it framed, and asked people what its message was. There were a lot of epmrans, but It was difficult to be sure what the artist intended. In fact, the work’s meaning was profound: If we grasp at only one thing, it’s easy for us to neglect the space all around us. This is similar to when you’re attached to someone. There are many things other than that person that can bring you happiness, but since you’re fixated on that person alone, you feel the entire world leaves you behind when you can’t get their affection. It’s much better to appreciate the many sources of happiness in our environment and to avoid becoming attached to a single person.
