**by Alfred McGlory, Jr.**

****I grew up in Marksville, Louisiana to Alfred McGlory, Sr. and and Emma Lou Williams, and they gave birth to six girls before finally having me. We stayed in a wooded area with our closest neighbors being a half a mile away. I played in the woods a lot, exploring nature and learning about and looking for bugs and turtles.

Being the baby in the family, I grew up in crap, and having six sisters but no brother wasn’t fun. I had no one to play with or talk with but Moma. My sisters played dolls, house, and jacks, and I wanted to play jacks with them, but they never let me play.

My daddy never really talked to or taught me anything. He would leave us home and come back drunk and fight with Moma, like for his food being too cold. I loved him anyway; he would always buy me airplanes, and I still love airplanes. Even so, Dad and I never talked about anything, but he would take me fishing with him sometimes. As I got older, Dad seemed to be lost in his thoughts, and Momma was doing her best to keep me out of trouble. I knew she really cared about and loved me.

My dad was sentenced to 108 years and sent to Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana. I lost my mom in 2009 and haven’t shook back since. Now that I’m in prison, I understand what my loss really means to me. I’m not in contact with most of my sisters, and I don’t hear from or write to my dad. We’re both in prison, and we’re both lost. I really want to reach out to him and let him know how I feel about him and ask him why he never talked with me as a child. I’m 40, and he’s 72 years old: time has been hard on the both of us. We are in different prisons, and truth is, I don’t really know who he is. I want him to know my child, his grandson, Xavier, so that he won’t be lost.
