**"Lost Reunion" by Edward Walsh**

I used to think that people went to prison, did their time, and got out. Nothing more. Just a temporary loss of freedom. Or maybe they had life or the death sentence and we never heard from them again. My idea of prison life was taken from the different television prison shows I watched. It wasn’t until I was actually sent to prison that I learned from experience that there is actually so much more than just doing time than getting out.

For instance, I never knew to what extent of losses that a prisoner suffer until I actually experienced it myself. I’ve lost all of my money, I had a top of the line car, a beach house, all the luxury furnishings to make living comfortable, and I had nice clothes. It’s all gone now. But all of this is just material stuff. Stuff that someday when I get out I can always replace.

When I first got into the prison system what I looked forward to the most was reuniting with my family and friends. And I was really looking forward to reuniting with my dog Fred. I couldn’t wait to go on our long walks along the beach. Or taking him to the neighborhood dog park to play. Then reality hit. My friends left me. Cut all ties with the criminal, the bad guy. The man they thought they knew and trusted but now despised. Family, forget about it. Everybody except my mother and her husband shut the door in my face. My two brothers, both younger than me, won’t even acknowledge my existence. My father and his wife disowned me. I never again heard from any of the other relatives that use to tell me that they loved me. The family reunion that I was looking forward to when I get out of prison burst like a balloon.

But I always had hope. I always stayed open to the possibility that they would have a change of heart. I wrote off my friends. They’re not good friends if they are not there when I need them the most. I always kept faith that someday I would reunite with my family though. I always wrote them letters. I send them birthday and holiday cards. I’ve even sent them drawings that I drew. I never expected anything in return. Although a letter from them would be nice.

I was in prison for about three years when one day I go called to the Chaplin’s office. He informed me that my brother had passed away. How could that be? He was four years younger than me. He was healthy and fit. After all he was a fireman and a paramedic. How could he be dead? Cancer; I didn’t even know he was sick. I never got to say goodbye. I never got to personally say, “Brother, I’m sorry, I love you.” There will be no reunion with my brother when I get out. I feel such a loss. We use to be so close. I never thought he would die. But there it is, part of prison life.

Four years into my incarceration I got called into the Captain’s office. My mom didn’t have much time to live. I was allowed one call to say goodbye. The last time I saw my mom was close to two years ago. I use to call her every week, and I knew she was sick with cancer. A few days after I said goodbye, she passed away. There will be no reunion between mother and son when I get out. My heart aches and now her husband is slowly closing the door on our relationship. Just like the others.

The only family I have left is my youngest brother. He won’t write me, and I can’t write him. He told my family never to give me his address. About a year ago my aging father decided to rebuild our relationship. And I am thrilled that now his wife is starting to write me. I thank God. Deep down I think we realize that we may not have too much time left. I love them both and pray that someday they can visit me.

Then there’s my dog Fred. He’s getting on in age. I got him as a puppy 12 years ago. He’s an old dog. I guess he’s 84 dog years old now. I guess I won’t be taking him for long walks along the beach; no dog parks.

Damn! I hate prison. I hate the losses. I hate the pain I have in my heart. This is the worst punishment man can set upon another man. To take him away from his family, his loved ones, their life. But it’s my fault. I brought this onto myself.

So I’m lying in my bunk trying to come to terms with all my losses. And the losses to come. The material stuff I can deal with. I’ve lost stuff before. But losing brothers, mothers, fathers, and my dog; I can’t get them back. There won’t be a grand family reunion when I get out of prison. No party. Just me alone.

But then I think, “Yes, someday there will be a family reunion.” When I’m older. When it’s my turn to die. My soul will leave my body and go to wherever souls tend to wander off to. And then we’ll have our reunion. My soul will be greeted by my brother, my mom, my dad, and yes, even Fred will be there. We will bask in the never ending love we share, and we will be reunited once again.
