**Dear Mom by Leo Cardez**

Thank you, mom, for introducing me to the world. I realize all of the sacrifices you made so my sister and I could live such an amazing life.

Thank you for giving me the freedom to be myself even if it meant turning the living room into my fort or trying my hand at becoming a thespian in high school.

You taught me to enjoy working hard. I watched you clean the house, cook all our meals, and leave the house to sell your handmade ware door-to-door my entire childhood. I was always so proud of you - although I hated going with you.

Thank you for your stubbornness, which helped me develop mine. Those ugly fights we had when I was a teen made me stronger - and thank you for your forgiveness. I’ve apologized countless times and I’m grateful for our ability to always make-up and move on without any scars.

Thank you for your open-mindedness; you are the least judgmental person I know. You’ve been there for me through all of my most difficult times either in-person or in spirit. Your love lives within me giving me strength and courage when I need it most. No matter the darkness, I can always feel your warm embrace. I’m ashamed to admit, it has saved me from doing the unthinkable on more than one occasion.

Thank you for putting me first. I know how hard it must have been. I demanded your attention ad nauseam. You married a good man who would become an even better father and you gave me a wonderful sister.

Thank you for always speaking respectfully of my father. Marriage can be painful at times, but you minimized it for me as much as possible. My heart mattered more than your need to vent. I know that took incredible strength.

I know that you think I’m completely independent and fine on my own - and most of the time I am. But no one else can give me the hug that makes me feel better when it seems like things all around me are crumbling. And I thank you for that more than anything because to this day, you holding me gives me that same feeling - an exhale, a warmth, a love so strong it doesn’t have words - as it did when I was a little boy.

Dedicated to Maria Enriqueta Hernandez Carrillo, the best mother and the most incredible woman I’ve ever known.
