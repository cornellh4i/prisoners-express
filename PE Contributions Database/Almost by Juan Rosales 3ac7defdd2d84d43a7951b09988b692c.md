**Almost By Juan P. Rosales**

Motivation: that’s my almost. An eye-opener in reflection, that too is my almost. I could have almost...easily, but I sit here surrounded by fences with razor wire, trapped in a box with four concrete walls that gave me wisdom. It is a beautiful blessing and I am free because I could have almost…

On the outside, where the fences and the walls do not restrict my body I was no saint. Even now I am not, nor do I claim to be. Yet, in all truth, I was not free.

The drugs had my hunger enslaved to the point where it could never be satiated. The call of flesh on flesh was far too great for my body to ignore. It willingly went to lust and no depravities would turn it away. The drugs and flesh were the key pieces in my rigmarole, to lose one was to lose the game, and to lose one was to lose face. Naturally, in this sickened state of mind I would secure them and challenge all shadows of threat. I could not afford to lose face.

I could have almost been strung out on drugs so thin and so taught that the snap was sure to come. I could have almost been a walking petri dish of viruses and diseases because monogamy was not in my vocabulary. I could have almost been the subject of a wholly fabricated eulogy. I would let no one in and in the end I would have rather lost my breath to save face.

I could have almost...my motivation...I could have almost...my wisdom...I could have almost...lost myself in death.
