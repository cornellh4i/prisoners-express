"This Isle" by Chad Dias

Welcome to the utopia which resides in my mind. 

A quiet place I like to go when I’m consumed by the woes of a hard time. 

Although it can be lonely at times, given I have no confidant to confide in. Ultimately it’s tranquility and peace of mind of which I’m trying to find. It’s while on this isle that I find time to collect my thoughts. 

Then I place them within a metaphorical bottle and simply cast them all off. My thoughts amount to letters or the occasional poem. Latent with hopes, growth and contentment or vulnerabilities of which just happened to get caught between words… 

You know something, it just dawned on me, that you see the same isle as me. So I guess I’m not in fact all alone, nor is this isle truly my own. The only aspects we can attribute to me are these choice words and the peace of mind this isle has provided for me.
