**"Island" by Daniel Alvarez**

This place seems like somewhere out of the imagination. Yet I've seen the picture, and it looks quite real. Yet my imagination plays on is there a talking bunny that lives there. Yes, this place seems like out of the imagination of a cartoonist who is making a fable. A fable is a story where all the characters are animals. Who would live here a bear and his friend named Christopher? Or how about a hero. This strong and mighty warrior lives in a place of pure serenity. When Plato imagined his utopia, did it include a place like this? I say we’re about 600 years away from achieving utopia here on earth. Yet 600 years from now I will only in the imagination. Just like this picture. If it is part of utopia, what is the opposite? A dark castle near an active volcano. But this place in this picture seems good, even perfect, for the occupant to find peace and harmony. Nearby he or she does their farming and is known by all the woodland creatures. Yes, woodland this seems like a place out of a woodland fable. Maybe there is an abbey nearby ran by marsupials? What obstacles has the occupant overcome? Did the occupant build it, or was the home of his or her parents? Maybe someone who was a friend to robin hood lived here? This place doesn’t seem to be on a beach, more like a lake. Or could it even be a swamp and the occupant is an ogre? Could be. If I was doing bird watching, what kind of birds would I see in those trees? Yes, this place has a lot of history and stories for the imagination.
