**“Unwanted Persistence” by Edward Cortes Williams Jr.**

My body is weaker than most, yet persistent. My early years were terrible. I wasn’t supposed to be born, or said the doctor. I should have died shortly after birth, he said, and so my mother should have too. Yet my body continued.

My ears reaped constant infection as a child. My lungs languished under the stress of asthma. My kidneys sometimes acted up. And the doctor broke my foot when I was delivered. Yet my body did not give out, weak as it was.

I fell down in a blizzard one day. I had to be carried in the hospital. I was 3. My homeostasis was shot to heck. I caught pneumonia quickly. Got it again a few years later. Still my body struggled on.

My body was used for the purpose of sick perverts who couldn’t control themselves. It was used also, for a short time, for a pain receiver, for a mentally ill mother who had been abused as well. Yet these things did nothing to halt my body, through my mind suffered.

My body grew a little stronger in my teenage years. No girls were attracted to it, but it did grow stronger. Even while my schizophrenic mind worsened, my body improved.

But when I was 17, it took another turn when I, like an idiot, thought I could be Goku. I consumed a monstrous amount of caffeine and damaged my heart. In the freezing cold I did this, wearing ankle weights and a heavy weight vest, trying to be like a fictional character convinced that psychokinesis and blasts and powers of all sorts were real. My body suffered from the psychosis of my mind. That was Christmas 2010. I nearly died. But my body persisted.

I then sought to destroy my pestiferous body, suicidal. Oh, my body gained its strength back and then some. It reached the muscular weight of 213 pounds. It was strong. Oh, but the body must follow the mind.

On April 3rd, 2012, I committed murder in an asanine attempt to obtain a gun, which would place a bullet in my skull. Why go through all the trouble? Why not just cut my wrists? Surely you ask these things. The body must follow the mind. The mind did not want the eyes to watch the wrist bleed out or feel the slow fade of pills. The mind wanted the body to slip into eternal sleep quite quickly. So the body had to follow. Yet the poorly planned plot failed. And my body kept going.

Even now, it will not quit. The kidneys of this body are failing. The heart has stopped three times. The circulation is poor. The stomach is...off. Not bad, just off. The skin is weakening. The forehead is acne ridden. The spine is deteriorating slightly. The hands shake when any drop of adrenaline is released. And the mind wishes that the body would just give up and give out. Yet my body will not quit, even under the pain. Even under the sleeplessness. God must have a plan for my body. My mind only hopes He will get on with it.

Adieu.
