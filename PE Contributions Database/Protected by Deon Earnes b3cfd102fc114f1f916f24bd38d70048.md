**Protected by Deon Earnest**

Being protected physically meant more to me than being protected mentally. I thought that having a gun on me in the free world and a shank on me while incarcerated was the true way to be protected. All along I was experiencing a false sense of reality. I also felt that doing drugs protected me mentally from the emotions that came from the actions and thoughts of my day to day living. I grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas where a person would shoot you for having on red or blue clothes, your hat turned to the left or right if you weren’t a person that lived or had ties to the neighborhoods that you traveled or visited. Now at the age of 36 years old, living in the Arkansas Department of Corrections for the 3rd time in the past eight years with county jail time on a 80 year sentence for guns, shanks, battery assaults, violent charges, etc. This lead me to truly know what being protected means. To me it means to be at peace with me, my loved ones and my creator. I took the time to open up my eyes to realize that just because a person isn’t shooting at me, trying to stab me, verbally abusing me, etc, didn’t mean that I was being protected. That we all have to die or get our feelings hurt one day. I believe that we can be our own enemy at times far worse than the pain and problems that can come from others. Having loved ones dying on the outside, inmates dying from smoking K2, dying from assaults and suicides has made me search deep down inside to find the happiness, love, and everything else that’s in between to put one foot in front of the other daily to move forward while not being worried about the protection of me and my loved ones. Because I am comfortable living with my definition of protection.
