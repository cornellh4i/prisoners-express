**"Family Reunion" by Corey Higgins**

They say family reunions are a time of great joy and to find out what’s going on with one another in the family. I remember at some of my old reunions when I was a teen, I would see and meet people I never even knew were in my family. As the years go by a family reunion is mostly of family members fighting or yelling at each other, not only that but as the internet has taken over I’ve noticed we don’t really drive or plan to meet the family on one date or place.

When my mother passed away was the last reunion we had and that still fights broke out. I could not bring myself to talk that day or week. My mother’s sister “Sandy” wanted everyone to go out and eat after the funeral to be happy for the passing instead of being sad and mad as I was. But it seemed in a way some kind of crazy reunion the only mother was gone, everyone tried to be nice and talk good things. Then a funny thing was said: “What a way to get the family to have a reunion.” Though some laughed, some said to stop it but the truth was it was in some kind of way a Family Reunion.

Now that I’m locked away for a pretty good part of my life, I think about these words “Family Reunion”, and though my family has gotten smaller or wants nothing to do with one another. The words are greatly loved. So as the days pass on I will be waiting for the day I get out and just maybe have a “Family Reunion”…
