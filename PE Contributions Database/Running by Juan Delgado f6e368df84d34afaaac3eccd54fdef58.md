**Running by Juan Delgado**

I’m always running for a better future, and I’m also running from my past wrongdoings. I run to feel good and the wind. Sometimes, I run just to breathe. I run home as a kid, I run to the bus stop when I’m late for work or school. My mind stays steady running from my own thoughts, always changing the pace or the page. My mouth tends to run when I speak when I’m nervous. My hand runs when I write from neat, till it drags. My car runs when I put it to drive, at the direction I choose to go. Time runs no matter where I am or where I go, or whether I’m on the move or on hold. People are always in a hurry, running to their death. I guess running is part of life, people run to be a president or candidate or a representative of the State. I guess it’s ok to be running for things we want to change, achieve or just to get some sense. I guess it’s best to buy a great pair of shoes to continue running everyday.
