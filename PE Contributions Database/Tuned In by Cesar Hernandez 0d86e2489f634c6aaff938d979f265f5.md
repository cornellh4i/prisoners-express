**Tuned In By Cesar Hernandez**

Having an American Express Platinum charge card is like being in an elite club. I did not know that such a club existed but I very quickly tuned in. I had several American Express cards including an American Express Rewards Gold Plus charge card. It was not until I got my Platinum card that I noticed I was being treated better. The four hundred fifty annual fee is completely worth it.

The American Express Platinum charge card has no pre-set limit. The only better card is the Centurion card. There is no way I could have a Centurion card since it requires a person to spend one hundred fifty thousand dollars for a year. When I got my Platinum card I quickly tuned in that I was treated better. Most servers in restaurants and sales people in stores know what an American Express Platinum card means. You have to have perfect credit and usually means you are rich. If you are rich that usually means that you will be treated extra nice. So hopefully to spend more and give good tips, I always made a habit to flash my Platinum card at every opportunity. Bartenders would give me extra strong alcoholic drinks, water would seat me at very good tables, and sales people would be extra nice. So I could buy more things. At hotels I would get very good rooms.

I definitely tuned in so that people in the Platinum club get better treatment. On one occasion my wife and I went to a four star restaurant. We walk in and the place is crowded. A man is basically yelling at the hostess about the long wait. He keeps telling her he is an American Express Gold card member and demands a table now. My wife and I look at each other and smile. We donâ€™t say a word. We go up to the hostess and pull out our Platinum cards. We tell the hostess we are American Express Platinum Card members and ask if our table is ready. The hostess immediately seats us at our table while the Gold card member is silent and overtly angry. His gold card did not get him prompt service.
