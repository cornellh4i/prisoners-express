**The Girl and the Dandelion by Mack McCauley**

He stood quietly and watched the girl as she leaned forward with a bemused look upon her face. She was intently studying the transformation of what had once been a lively, radiant bunch of field dandelions into the lifeless husks that now remained. Just one week ago she had stood there, in almost this exact place, wanting to pick these dandelions to create a bouquet for her grandmother. I had advised against it, explaining as best as I could in such a way as for her to grasp about the cycle and continuity of life. To better illustrate the lesson, we had come to visit each day to watch as the dandelion progressed through its lifecycle, from the vibrant sun- yellow flower it had been to its gradual transformation into seeds. A “fluff-ball” she had called, with its seeds perched precariously like paratroopers ready to jump and ride the winds until safely returning to the Earth, ready to create new dandelions. She had helped some of the seeds along their journey by blowing on them so she could watch them float on the breeze with delight and awe in her eyes.

Now here she stood, with a wreath of wildflowers crowning her head as she contemplated the final cycle of this bunch of dandelions. The look of bemusement slowly faded and transformed into one of immense distress as some revelation of hypothesis formed and set in her head.

“ Grandpa? She asked quizzically. “Does the same thing happen to all flowers?”

The deep look of sadness seemed to fill her soul and I perceived a glimpse of it escaping through her eyes as she looked steadily at me, awaiting a response. For a moment, I regretted ever having stopped her from picking the dandelions, having never foreseen the depth of which she would contemplate this life’s lesson. Even with my regret, I knew I must allow her to finish connecting the dots to one of life’s most primal lessons. “Yes sweetheart.” I replied, “Not only flowers, all living things. We all get from start to finish in different ways, but we are all born, live, and die. Hopefully we can be like the dandelion by bringing a small amount of beauty and joy to the world around us, then pass it along for future generations to see and appreciate. If you remember nothing else, remember this: Life is made up of moments, living is recognizing and enjoying those moments.”

She pondered my words a moment, seemed to accept them, then stood up and removed the wreath of flowers from her head. She laid them at the base of the dandelion plant. An offering of recognition to a life that had existed and had made a difference if to no one else but one small child.
