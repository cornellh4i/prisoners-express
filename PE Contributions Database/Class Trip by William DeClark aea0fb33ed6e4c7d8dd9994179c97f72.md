***Class Trip* by William DeClark**

****The rain fell even harder as my wife Diane and I, along with our 17 year old daughter Lillian, pulled up to the airport entrance. Lilly was set to fly out to London with her senior class. Between the weather and traffic, we barely made it in time.

The PA announced, “Now boarding. USA Flight 119 nonstop to London. Gate 6.”

“That’s you!” I said to Lilly, “You better hurry if you want to make it through security in time!”

She scrambled out of the car with Diane and me following, and I handed lilly her umbrella while Diane ran to get the bags out of the trunk.

“You have your ticket?” I asked.

“Yes, Dad.”

I noticed she seemed apprehensive. “Are you OK?” I asked. “If you’d rather not go, we can still cancel. I’m sure they’d understand.”

“Yeah right, and have my whole class laugh at me? Please. I’m just nervous about my flight. That’s all.”

“I understand,” I told her. “I was a nervous wreck the first time I flew, but don’t worry. Even though you probably don’t believe it now, you’ll most likely sleep most of the way. When you wake up, you’ll be there, and then you’ll have so much fun that you won’t remember the flight.”

Diane handed lilly her luggage. “Here you go, honey. Have a great trip. Don’t forget to call as soon as you check into the hotel.”

We all exchanged hugs and kisses, then Lilly headed for the door. I called after her, “Take lots of pictures!” She looked back with a smile and wave, and then she was through the door and gone, blending in with the airport crowd.

On the way home, I noticed Diance seemed quieter than usual. “You OK, babe?” I asked.

“I’m just thinking about Lilly. I’m sure it’s just because it’s her first time she’s been away from home, but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s going to happen to her.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “Look how many times I’ve flown across the country for work. Smooth sailing every time. Well, except for that one time…” Diane gave me a look that says “you’re not helping.” I took her hand and said, “Look. If it makes you feel better, this isn’t easy for me either. It just seems like yesterday she was four years old, climbing up in my lap and begging me to read her those princess stories she had. Remember those? I must’ve read her those at least a thousand times! Now my own little princess is almost grown up and about to graduate high school. But I’m telling you she’ll be fine. SHe’ll come home with all kinds of stories and probably talk our ears off for hours.”

Diane gave me a sad smile and sighed. “You’re probably right. It’s hard to believe our little girl isn’t so little anymore.”

It was well after midnight by the time we got home. We were both pretty wiped out and headed straight for bed. The following morning, I let Diane sleep in while I raided the kitchen. I thought she would enjoy breakfast in bed for a change. However, when I brought her food,s he only picked at it, and I don’t think the problem was my cooking.

“Still have that bad feeling about Lilly?” I asked, rubbing her shoulders.

“Yeah, worse than last night. I thought she’d call by now. Maybe I better try calling her phone.”

“Well, they probably just landed,” I said. “The flight itself is over 7 hours long, and I’m sure they were delayed last night because of the rain. It wouldn’t surprise me if they were just checking in now. Give her another hour or so before you try calling. Meanwhile, I’ll clean up this mess.”

I gathered up the dirty breakfast dishes and headed for the kitchen. I heard the TV in the bedroom come on; my wife was getting her morning dose of Fox News. Moments later, I heard a shriek from the bedroom, and so I dropped the dishes and ran to see what was going on. I found Diane with her hands pressed to her face as she sat on the bed and stared eyes wide open at the TV. “What is it?!” I cried.

She pointed toward the TV which showed a reporter standing in front of a hellish scene of twisted metal and smoking ruins.

“In breaking news this morning,” the reporter announced, “USA Flight 119 has crashed while on approach to London’s Heathrow Airport. All aboard are feared dead…”
