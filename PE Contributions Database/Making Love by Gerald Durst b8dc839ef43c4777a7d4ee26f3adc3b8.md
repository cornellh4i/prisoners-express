**Making Love by Gerald Durst**

We were laying there in my queen size bed, holding each other, my hands still caressing her… one hand was, the other was still enjoying the feel of her left breast. Her nipple was hard against my palm. I have a quick recovery time, and needless to say, I wanted to be with her again.

I could feel the heat from the glow of orgasm radiating off her body as she slowly, gently rubbed her ample bottom against me. I know that she too wanted another go round.

“Baby, I love to f---.” She said breathlessly. She was still breathing pretty heavy.

I said, “Honey, that was making love.”

“Making love, f---ing, same thing. It all feels so good” she replied.

“No, no, no,” I said. “Making love is slow, easy, and time consuming. How long was I down on you before you began begging me to stop?”

She lay quiet for a moment. I could feel the smile on her face in her entire body. “I lost track of time while you were down there. You were teasing me so much, and it felt soooo...mmmmm.”

“I was down there at least two hours before you begged me to stop. You said you couldn’t take any more. So, I stopped, and then I made love to you.”

“Oh, what’s the difference?” She asked.

I said, “Let me show you.” I was ready to go again. So, as we lay there spooning, I entered her again.

“Making love,” I said as I took my time, “is about feeling. It’s about caring about the other person. It’s not about me.”

“It’s about ensuring that the other person gets theirs. I put a lot of time and care into ensuring that you receive the most pleasure you can from our being together.”

I took my time with a nice steady rhythm that she began to match. After a minute or two of this I got a good, strong grip on her curry hip, and began to pound her hard and fast.

“This, my dear, is f---ing.” I said to her as I slammed myself into her.

I went on like this for several minutes before I slowed back down, then stopped, then rolled her onto her back, and continued face-to-face.

“Wow!” She said as she looked into my eyes. “I never thought there was a difference. I have to admit that f---ing doesn’t last long, and is not near as satisfying as making love.”

Another satisfied lover.
