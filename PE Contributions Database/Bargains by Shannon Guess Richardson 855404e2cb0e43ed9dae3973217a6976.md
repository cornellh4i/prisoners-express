**Bargains by Shannon Guess Richardson**

The word “bargain” can carry many different meanings depending on the person and the situation. It can mean a deal. It can mean a settlement. Or it can mean a good value. According to Webster, it means, “something that you buy cheaply.”

To a person charged with a crime, the word “bargain” takes on a whole different meaning. We are sometimes offered a plea “bargain.” Sometimes, it really is a bargain and refusing to sign would be idiotic. But there are so many people who are forced into signing what they think is a bargain, but it bargains no one but the government.

What about those who are truly innocent? Yes, they are few and far between, but they absolutely do exist. They are told to sign this “bargain” or spend the rest of their life in prison. It is the right of the prisoner to accept or decline. But is there really a choice? Or are we being bullied into signing big portions of our lives away in the hopes of one day regaining our freedom?

Once we do sign these “bargains,” many people realize that they have also signed away the right to appeal or file any post-conviction motions. Most people do not realize the significance of what they have signed away until they get to prison and talk to people with legal knowledge, when it’s too late.

Have you ever heard “ignorance of the law is no excuse?” Well, with that in mind, why are we not taught law in school since we apparently to be held to the same standards as an attorney and are expected to know we are being screwed over?

The fundamentals of the United States Constitution and the entire United States “Justice” System have veered so far off-track from what our founding fathers had intended it to be, they wouldn’t even recognize it. We need to get back to the basics the way our founding fathers intended. We need to get America back to the America that soldiers that soldiers shed their blood and risked their lives for. Back when crime rates were lower and children were taught morals and consequences in school without the fear of a lawsuit. Back to when mass incarceration was not an issue and families were not destroyed because of it.

Bargains can come in all shapes and sizes. But for prisoners, they come at such a high price. Does anyone out there care? The bigger question is what are we going to do about it?
