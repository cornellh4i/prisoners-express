***Faith* by Michael Lanning**

“What? You thought I would descend from heaven. Have I not said I am the living water? You doubt I could ascend from water. You have eyes yet you do not see. You have ears yet do not hear. My word has been with you for over 2000 years, and still, you do not believe. What I, Jehovah God, asks of you is faith. My invisibility is the truest test of that faith. To know who sees me, I make myself unseen. Now here I am, flesh and bone appearing out of water. Still, you have no faith.”
