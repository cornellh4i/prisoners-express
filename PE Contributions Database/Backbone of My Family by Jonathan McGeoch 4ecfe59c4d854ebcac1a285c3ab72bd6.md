Backbone of My Family by Jonathan McGeoch

My grandfather was an ox of a man, a beacon of strength and courage. To the world, he may just have been an average guy, spending a lifetime plugging away on a farm. He lived in the same town his whole life. He had great ambitions, but he really was loyal to his family, to the lot life had handed him. My grandfather knew all the ins and outs of farming and was always tinkering around to fix things. He never had an idle moment, but constantly found something to keep himself busy.

But he had other hobbies as well. He loved to travel around the country to just get out and drive. He owned a small 4-seater Piper airplane. As a child, he would always take me up and let go of the control so I could take over for a while. He was thorough with his pre-flight checks and taught me great attention to detail.

When we would fix or build a new section of the fence, he would hold the end of the nails in his mouth to quickly grab the next one. When I picked up this habit, my father complained that it wasn’t good for me. At the time, I didn’t understand why it was okay for Grandpa, but not for me.

His group always cooked the Pancake Breakfast at the local Balloon Festival. I would spend a night at his house and got up at 3 to help prepare. It was so much fun and I always got to watch the balloons go up.

Though my grandfather is no longer with us, he will endure in my memory for the rest of my life.
