**“Couple at Table” by David Brown**

Today is the day that we’ve all been waiting all year for. Are you going to be ready? Of course, we've went over this a thousand times and I know exactly which way to go. But are you going to be able to walk and run, walk and run, walk and run. I think so, but if you can do it, know I can do it. Plus I run faster than you anyways, you may be stronger, but you know I’m faster.

Today, we’ll rest up and get mentally prepared for tonight, which will be our night. It’s been a long time coming. Remember last year didn't turn out so well. Yeah I know but that was last year, and we've been blessed to see another year and we’re both healthy enough to give it another shot. I love you sis. I love you too now let's get some rest.

Wake up! Wake up! What time is it? I don't know but it’s getting dark. Better early than late. Last year we left too late that’s why… I don’t even want to talk about it. Forget the past, it is our future that awaits us. It’s so early we don't even have to sneak out, we can just ask. But how far we go will be what they don’t know . Here goes nothing. Can we go out? Go right ahead but you know your boundaries and you should have the rules memorized. (We do).

As we make it through the woods and far away we can stop to catch our breath. How far do you think we’ve went? I'm not sure, but we should start seeing people and other houses soon. Now the 1st person we see we can’t just blurt it out. We have to know that they’re good people . It’s also been that the people who have their porch light on is where we go- they’re waiting for us. Speaking of porch lights there’s one now. Are you ready? I better be I’ve been waiting for this just as much as you. Now hurry up and knock on the door. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! The door opens……..
