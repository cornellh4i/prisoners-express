**When life gives you trials make victory!**

**By Jack E Dyson**

A wise woman once told me “Everyone makes mistakes. It’s how we learn from them and deal with them that determines the type of person we are or will become.” Many people succumb to their trails on a daily basis. Surely, I am counted among the multitude that has fallen victim. I am also more than certain, that I will at some point in time crumble again. What is life, but a test of perseverance. The practice of rebuilding a shattered character and leaving the defects on the ground. I know it’s hard to understand for those that do not live in perpetual challenge. Those that delude themselves in to the sophistry that they’re fine the way they are and need no improvement. For those like me that are not easily subdued with mediocrity, you realize the truth in this short essay. You realize that nothing not even life can define us. No, it only serves to refine us as long as we are willing to step out of our comfort zone and take a risk. You also know that risk is a double-edged sword at times; leaving you momentarily elated until later on down the road you realize it as a mistake or those times when, right after you take the risk it drops a whole dump truck full of problems upon you. I know, (we know), that without the problems, mistakes, risks, there would be no trials. How can you truly appreciate the good if you don’t know the bad? How do you know you’re “up” if you’ve never been “down”? So I leave you with this, even if all looks dreary and depressing, as your cell door gets slammed in your face or the judge bangs his gavel and the word “LIFE” seeps between his smiling, hating mouth. Remember one thing, when life gives you trials make victory. I know it may come off as cliche to write but try it. Pour yourself into it and let it filter you and build your character. Until that same smiling, hateful judge doesn’t know why he sentenced you or that long lost love forgot why she left you. Just a little effort my friend, will keep you smiling ‘til the end.
