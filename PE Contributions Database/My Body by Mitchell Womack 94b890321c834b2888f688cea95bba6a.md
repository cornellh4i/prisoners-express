**My Body by Mitchell Womack**

Scars symbolize how my past always endeavors to be present, visual reminders of events no longer seen except by my mind’s eye.

Some scars on my hands incriminate me of once breaking bathroom-and-back windows, to burglarize houses. Scars on the inside of my mouth, on my lip, and those on my knuckles show that I can take punches as well as give them. And pockmarks on my face remind me of insecurities as a teen that I’d sooner forget.

A scar on my stomach and lines of them on my forearm expose a suicide attempt that was a farce, yet little tiny scars on the crooks of the inside of my arms warn how even when one doesn’t inttend to commmit suicide, one damn near does just that.

There’s a scar on my right eye that proves I seen death one day, but lived to tell you about it.

Most of my tattoos are permanent glimpses of a reckless young adult, inconsiderate of what the future might think of the marks we bear, yet the areas of skin untouched by needle and ink are a canvas of how I’m no longer together with my mistakes, but have married a second chance, of the chapters that haven’t been written yet.

Chapters that describe how I desire my feet to walk with God, and how I pray for forgiveness for all the times I strayed, with my knees on the ground and my hands together. For I can no longer stomach long periods without talking to Him. You see, my heart does love Him, and is no longer content with things of the world but yearns for His will.

The chapters yet to be written will unravel a story about a man who prays for the day my thoughts are only of Him, the day my hands build up instead of tearing down, the day I not only hear but listen, not only look but see, not only speak but reach, the day my body is a testimony of redemption.
