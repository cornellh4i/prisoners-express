"First Time" by Steven P. Arthur

The ornately framed black and white photo she kept on the nightstand, I would find out later, was of her and the moment her whole life change. The fork in the road that she wished most she could relive and choose wiser.

The first time I entered her bedroom, led by the hospice nurse, the photo drew my eyes to it. Even before I made out her small emaciated shape the sheets of the hospital bed. But the pronouncement of the photo didn’t really surprise me. Because, other than the photo under a plane lamp sitting on the nightstand and the patient Barbara McKinney, the room was empty. Despite having lived in that very home for more than thirty years and raised three children in it, that room looked as if she had just been moved into. I knew she had a family that loved and cared for her. It had been the patriarch of the family that been contacted to come and meet with her. When I arrived at the residence I met three more generations of McKinney’s outside. They had music playing, food on the grill and the little ones were playing in the yard. Inside the more mature were lounging in the living room talking in hushed tones. It appeared that this family reunion was choreographed so everyone could offer some insight into Barbara’s life and would be punctuated by me the ghostwriter.

David, a stout man with a thick head of iron grey hair, wanted to memorialize his wife and her life in the form of a biography. She had lived a life of service, starting when she graduated college and volunteered to station in Japan during the Vietnam War, where she met Lieutenant David McKinney. It was his gift to the woman he had loved for nearly forty years.

“Mrs. McKinney? You have a visitor.” The nurse said just over a whisper. “Mrs. McKinney?”

The shape under the sheet moved slightly. Which for the first time drew my eyes away from the photo. She was looking at me but spoke to the nurse.

“Helen. Dear. Please call me Barbara. You’ve been here so long you’re nearly family.”

“Yes. Of course I’m sorry ma...Barbara. This is Mr. Welch, he’s here…”

“I know why he’s here. Help me sit up dear. Would you bring our guest a chair please.”

“Yes. Barbara.”

I reached my hand out after the nurse repositioned Barbara to a sitting position.

“Ma’am. Please call me Steve.” Her hand was cold and as small as a child but strong. The nurse brought me a chair and I sat while we went through some social and business formalities. When I began asking questions she stopped me to explain what she truly wanted to convey as a message of her life. One last gift and service to others.

“You see, young man, the reason my room is not filled with furniture, flowers, pictures, and cards is because I want my last days to be focused on my one true failure. You see that picture of me there. I’m young, healthy and if I don’t say so myself, beautiful. But you see what I have in my hand. What I’m looking at. My first cigarette. It was my first and I didn’t quit until three years ago. That’s when I was diagnosed with inoperable lung and brain cancer. So you see, that was the moment when I started killing myself. I won’t be around this time next year but I want to share all of this with the world, especially with my family.

So I leaned back with my notepad and asked her. “Where do we begin?”

She leaned over, her arm shaking with effort and picked up the framed photo and said, “Right here. With the first one.”
