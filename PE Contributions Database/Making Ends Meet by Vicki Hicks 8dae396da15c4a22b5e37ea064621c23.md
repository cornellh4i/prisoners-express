**Making Ends Meet by Vicki Hicks**

About twelve years ago I made a decision that would alter my life as I knew it. My children all played sports on travel teams, my husband liked expensive toys with very expensive accessories, and I could not keep the bills paid to save my life. You see I could not say NO! Now I am not blaming my family for my decisions, but they are the reason for it all the same. We tried to take a second mortgage out to consolidate and that led to more debt and before I knew it, I was drowning all by myself. There was no way I could tell my husband that I was behind on almost every bill we had; I was embarrassed that I could not even get that right. I decided to start small by taking just a little money and then more and more money until it caught up to me. On April 15, 2016 my life totally changed. I was arrested and now have spent 4 years and 3 months trying to fix relationships that have forever been changed because of one decision I made on my own trying to keep to my family happy. I no longer have to try to make ends meet. If I donâ€™t have it; I can not go out and get it so I have come to realize that if I can live on this little amount I will never have to take money that does not belong to me. I can survive on very little. I have come to realize that my family would have survived without the extra money I took never actually made ends meet, but did damage my relationship with my husband of 28 years and my youngest child.
