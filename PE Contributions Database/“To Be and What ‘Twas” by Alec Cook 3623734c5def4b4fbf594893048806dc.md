**“To Be and What ‘Twas” by Alec Cook**

There is so much potential, for in one’s hands one holds, not only their own future, but the future for all generations to come. Where to go from here necessarily implies that there is a here from where to go— a present moment, an ‘I’ behind that moment, and a choice.

Too often, the choice is lost in squalor: indecision is not a failure to decide, after all. We walk, blind. We talk, small. We think, but more often, we do not. In our hands rests the fruition of every decision history has provided thus far, and with it, every decision history has yet to produce.

Hearts often ache over their location, and tears shed with no place to fall. We live in a land of abundance, but our main indulgences are in quiet self-destruction. To live is to breathe, a quip goes, but I have seen too many dead whose lungs still function. They are what society calls “average,” and on a good day “conducive”.

But within them I also see the seeds; seeds of potential that carry, not only trees but forests and cities. Of course, however, they must first find fertile ground and sunlight.

“Be a light unto yourself,” the pundits brashly state, unaware of what it’s like to have been born into darkness.
