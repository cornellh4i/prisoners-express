**“Emerging from the Fog into Conscious Self-Realization” by Frederick Harris**

****There are some things terribly wrong with our society. There’s too much chaos and hatred. The wars, the fighting. It’s as if society is enveloped in a fog of illusions that cloud our minds and makes peace an abstract dream; an intangible reality…

I’ve been locked away from the so-called “free” society, in one penal institution or another for most of my life. It if was not an oxymoron I would describe my plight as a blessing and a curse. But a curse cannot simultaneously be a blessing no more than heat can be cold, right?

But I suppose it’s all relative. Because one couldn’t know heat without being cold, just like one couldn’t know peace without knowing war. What is the famous saying? “We make war so we can have peace”? Yeah right. And I’m Toucan Sam disguised as a black man with dreadlocks…

Why does society buy into what the rhetoric politicians feed us? We all know it’s not true. That the ends never justify the means, and that real lives are being used like pawns in a real life chess game being played for the benefit of only a few at the cost of so many.

I was part of a street organization, living a “thug life” since I was a shorty. I’ve participated in street wars, and jailhouse “riots.” I’ve been shot and stabbed, yet, I survived.

And being incarcerated has given me a lot of time for “introspection.” I’ve sat inside my 6’ x 10’ cell and thought a lot about who I am, and what life is all about. What I’ve come to realize is that I had been living in total darkness. Unaware of my true self and my purpose in this life. I realized that all the trials and tribulations I’ve struggled through were designed to build me into the man I am to become. I have emerged from the fog into “conscious self-realization,” which is the process of knowing who you are, what your purpose and/or potentials are and striving to be that person every single day…

I’ve also come to realize that any problem can be solved. The problem must simply be identified and understood first. So with respect to mass incarceration, recidivism, black on black violence and other criminalistic behaviors that contribute to the epidemic of black genocide, which has a ripple effect that pervades every aspect of our society, we must realize and understand that these are only extensions of an underlying problem. Bigotry and racism.

But how could something so conspicuously ignorant be the cause of so much trouble? Because the whole world wants to believe in the fallacious notion of “equality,” which is nothing but an illusion. Because the actual state or condition of “equality” does not and cannot exist. It is simply a word that has been exploited for propaganda.

So, from my perspective, the way to supercede racism and prejudices associated with it is to wake up from the “American dream.” Because we are not all created “equal,” and we are not all endowed with inalienable rights. We are all born into this world special, precious and unique “individuals” with a chance to live and to learn (by living) how to manifest our individual destinies “harmoniously” with one another.

People choose to hate and participate in wars only because they don’t realize that there’s the option to love and to accept. And this is especially true for inner city youth who cling to gangs, drugs and violence as their only source of power. They do it because they don’t realize they have “options.” Because their mental and emotional development gets arrested (figuratively and literally) with illusions designed to distract them (us) from the truth. The truth of ourselves and how we fit in the world we live in.

But, just like waking up from a real dream (is that an oxymoron?) we realize we’re dreaming first. Then we try to control what’s happening in the dream. And then when things don’t go as we want them to go, we get up…
