**“Picture Theme” by Teddy Lewis**

O.k. So, you agreed to go on a date with me, and as I sit here and I look at you, words just can’t express how beautiful you are, yet my timing may not be perfect for a long-term relationship (but we have to try ‘cause you just might be the one)...

Your attention span is difficult if I’m not interesting, but the best way to a woman’s heart is to tell what’s in mine, and this should work well for both of us… I’m sure I love you because our nature does remind me of who you really are, so tonight, I need to propose a toast to the endless possibilities of you and I…

Peace
