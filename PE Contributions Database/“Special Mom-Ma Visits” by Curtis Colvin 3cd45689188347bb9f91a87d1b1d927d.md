**“Special Mom-Ma Visits” by Curtis Colvin**

Back when I was a pre-teen (and a few years later), every holiday, Mom and Dad would pack us up and go to Deweyville, TX. What’s in Deweyville? Nothing much. My brother and sisters would have to think up stuff to do outside, where we were sent, away from grownups. We walked and roamed the dusty, sandy roads of the neighborhood (yes, most of the roads were made of sand!).

But there were things we did that were our first. First abandoned house that we went in and investigated (scary!), first time to pray inside a graveyard (spooky), first time to row a boat in a pond (fun). But it was all part of growing up (adventure!).

The main, or best, reason for the holiday trips was Mom-Ma. She was great! Her love was genuine, and her cooking was out of this world! The whole time we’re outside playing, I’m thinking about eating. She cooked that well!

When they called us in for supper, everything was set up. Newspaper was put down on the floor for us kids to sit on and eat, just in case of spillage. All the grownups sat at the small table to eat.

But it didn’t make a difference to me where I sat; my mind was on the food. Her specialty was a roasted cooked to the point that it was almost falling apart, thin homemade gravy, and lima beans with salt bacon in them; that was out of this world! When she cooked fried chicken… wow!

I miss her greatly. Sometimes I feel I loved Mom-Ma more than Mom… but don’t tell her that!
