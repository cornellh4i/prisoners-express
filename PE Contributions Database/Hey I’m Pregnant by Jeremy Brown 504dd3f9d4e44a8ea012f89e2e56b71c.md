**Hey I’m Pregnant by Jeremy Brown**

“Hey, I’m pregnant,’ Sarah said, trying to get Kim’s attention. ‘Bitch didn’t you hear me I’m pregnant. Take that cancer stick out of your mouth.”

Kim was leaning against the discolored brick wall, indifferent. Staring at the clouds’ changing formless in in their operation. Kim turned to Sarah. “So who's the lucky guy this time? Don’t tell me you’re going to get an abortion,” Kim spoke scoffing and rolling her eyes at her promiscuous friend.

“In-vitro fertilization”

“You went to a sperm bank? I told you if you wanted to mess around, I don’t care just don’t bring any man’s animals back to the house.”

“I wanted us to have a genius baby. They paired me with a genetically enhanced sperm baby or something. That way our kid will be the breadwinner and take care of us when we are older. I don’t want an idiot for a kid,” Sarah said smiling.

“How do you know if we’ll get old and still be together?” Kim said in a soft voice.

“Because, honey, only I can deal with your bipolar-schizo personality.”

Kim slapped Sarah in the face. Sarah slapped Kim. They looked at each other with lust in their eyes. Sarah grabbed Kim by the hair and pulled her down, forcefully kissing her. They both embraced as spectators gathered outside Starbucks with their phones and recorded such a spontaneous lesbian moment. The very next day, lying naked in bed while Kim was at work, Sarah was viewing the viral video shot of them at Starbucks. A friend emailed it to her. Over 900,000 views! “Oh my fucking gosh, we went viral, this is so crazy,” she thought. The next morning Sarah heard a knock at the door. She opened it and Paparazzi were everywhere. She slammed the door.

Sarah called Kim saying, “I can’t even kiss my lover without someone invading my privacy.”

“Sweetie I’ve got...I know, they’re here at my work too.”

For the next six months they both were being bothered by so much attention that they had to make a plan. “We need to fake our own deaths and then we can live with the Indians in the Shasta Mountains,” said Sarah.

“And have all the wild sex we want?” said Kim deviously.

“Without being bothered” Sarah said tightlipped. So in the dead of night they had their friend Abdul rig a timed pipe bomb in their apartment. They rolled away in their hummer to the Mountains in peace and in love. Back in the city their whole apartment burned down very fast. A chemical accelerator was applied. Their baby was born and they named him “Pheonix Fire.” He was so intelligent he built biomechanical cyborg babies for everyone when the technology was available. That way his mothers could live in peace and love each other in the mountains forever.
