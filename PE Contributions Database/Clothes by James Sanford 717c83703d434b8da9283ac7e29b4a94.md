**Clothes by James Sanford**

“Keep my clothes!” I told the cop on my way out the door. He looked at me like I was nuts. He was the crazy one trying to keep me in jail.

I was nineteen years old and I had just finished serving up a three year prison sentence. Upon my release, I was rearrested at the gate and brought to county jail to clear up an old warrant. It was something trivial, and definitely not worth all the extra effort.

To my dismay, it took a couple of weeks to get in front of the judge. I was very anxious. I knew I was going home, I just didn’t know when. Finally, my number was called to have my day in court. It felt like winning the lottery.

They called my name and I entered the courtroom. The first thing I saw was my mom sitting in the front row. I could not wait to give her a big “free” hug.

My moment arrived. The judge knew the situation and dismissed the old case. I remember him being pissed about “wasting taxpayer dollars on this.” The only thing I really heard him say was “immediate release.”

Filled with excitement, I practically ran over to my mom. Now I just wanted to go home.

I was slapped back to reality when two cops approached, and one of them put his hand on my shoulder. The outspoken one said, “Hey buddy, you are going to have to go back to jail with the prisoners to get your clothes. We can’t let you leave here in a county jail jumpsuit.”

Without the slightest hesitation, I unbuttoned the orange jumpsuit and stepped out of it wearing just my socks, sneakers and t-shirt. As I slipped my sneakers back on, I handed the jumper to the shocked, red-faced guard. He didn’t say anything.

Everyone in the courtroom was flabbergasted. They say it is always the things you least expect. I proceeded to walk out of court that day and nobody stopped me.

I hopped in the front seat of mom’s car and we went home. She told me she loved me, but I was crazy. I miss my mom.

The moral of the story is: Northing, especially not some stupid clothes, should keep us in jail a moment longer than we have to be. Thanks.
