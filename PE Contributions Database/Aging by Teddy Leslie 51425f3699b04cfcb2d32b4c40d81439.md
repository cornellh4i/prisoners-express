**"Aging" by Teddy Leslie**

This is a topic I can say that I don't like to think about. I want to stay young forever, but I know that I cannot control Karma.

I do believe that the aging process can be slowed by good health and safe behaviors. My immune system is strong, and I maintain my body fat buildup with exercise. I hope to look good later on.
