My Parents By Dan Perkins

He was 21 and she was 19 when I was born. My earliest memory of my father is with my mother and me with my father, and he was wearing his army dress uniform. The war was over, and we were on a train, and he was coming home from the war. I was not yet two.

My earliest memory of my mother is of her giving me a bath in the bathtub -- my father was overseas, in Okinawa. My father was my dad, and my mother was my mom. Not every father is a dad. Not every dad is the father. Same with mother/mom.

My parents stayed together to the end. He died when he was 77. She died two years later when she was 77. In the war, he started out as an MP, stationed at Tonopah, Nevada. Then he got stationed to Payne Field, near Seattle, Washington, and was an MP there. There he transferred to motorpool, and was a truck driver.

My mother was born in Monroe, Washington, near Everett, where I was born. My dad was born in Mt. Gregor, Texas. They met while he was stationed at Payne Field. Dad sent to Okinawa. Years later, when we were living in Seattle, we were watching a war documentary on TV. The US landing on Okinawa was shown, and he saw his trick in the landing. Later, he got into the Army Air Corps as a photographer. He went up in B-24s as an aerial photographer. The photographer's station was night behind the waist governor’s station. When a waist governor got hit, he had to fill in. He got knocked down once when three rounds from a Japanese fighter raked diagonally across his chest. They didn’t penetrate his flak vest, but he got knocked down. It knocked the wind out of him and bruised him. Twice, a bomber he was on got shot down, and the crew bailed out. Another time, a Japanese fighter glanced off the top of the bomber he was on and tore a hole in it, he said,“Big enough to drop a Jeep through.” He relished, and likely embellished his war stories. My mom was in love with him to the end. He was a harsh disciplinarian. That’s how he was raised. Maybe the war had something to do with it, too. PTSD it’s called now. All in all, though. I think he was really good dad. And he could fix anything, and he was a tough nugget. I wanted to be like him. Tough like him, and wizard with tools. My mom was a great cook. And she made me help her in the kitchen sometimes, and taught me how to cook some of the things she cooked. And she taught me kitchen, bathroom, and general household hygiene. And you know what? I’m damn glad she did. I ain’t no “Felix Unger” but I ain’t “Oscar Madison” either. I’m more Felix-ish than Oscar-ish. They both saw to my education, and saw to it I graduated high school, and saw to it I got some basic “churchin.” My dad settled into engineering.

My mom was always the “domestic engineer”, though she took employment sometimes, too. Between them both, I’d say they did a heroic act, supporting themselves and five boys and pets.
