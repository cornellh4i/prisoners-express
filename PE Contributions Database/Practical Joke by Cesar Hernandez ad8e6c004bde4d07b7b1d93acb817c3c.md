**"Practical Joke"** **by Cesar Hernandez**

To this day, I still do not know if this was a pretend joke or not. There was a dead cat in my driveway. During my lunch hour, I rushed home to get my shopping list. I was going to make my wife a special meal and did not want to go to the grocery store after work. I ran inside the house to get my list. On the way back to the car, I saw a dead cat right next to the driver's side door. I had not noticed it and was glad I didn’t step on it minutes before.

I had no idea where the cat came from, but I wouldn’t put it past my neighbor. He was always throwing trash on my property. So I planned to put the dead cat right on his front door mat. I got a shovel and tried to pick up the cat. It was rock hard, and it freaked me out. That cat had to have been dead for a day or two. I called the city to have them pick up the dead cat. Our property rates were very high, and I fully expected them to handle the situation. Every other year our street was completely pulled up and repaired. It took me about twenty-five minutes to go to the grocery store and come back to the house. When I arrived back home, the dead cat was no longer in my driveway.
