**Tricky Business by Yankee Lawyer**

I am often asked why I didn’t kill Pamela. I knew she had the home court advantage, that there was a lot of money involved, and that interfering in her professional affairs would be tricky business. If I didn't kill her, she would try to kill me.

I made a printout of some of her business correspondence, and hid it in a safe place. I picked up my clients and drove them to the courthouse myself. I don’t know how she knew where we were, but before we could talk to the judge, Pamela kidnaped me and did horrible things to my clients. I escaped about twelve days later, made my way through side streets and alleyways to the courthouse, and obtained a couple of orders from the district court.

Pamela had tried to kill me several times. Aided by Sgt.Dexter Lame of the Burlington Police Department, and a major law firm I survived. Pamela defied the court order, holding my clients in an undisclosed location. I was getting ready to file a contempt petition when Sgt.Danny King arrested me.

Pamela and her cohort had tried to lock me up several times by then, but had never come up with a charge that would stick, and every court appearance gave me another public venue in which I told the truth about them. Two had been naming names, dates and locations in City Hall. The newspapers and on television. They knew that if I ever had a fair sentence to tell my whole story in a criminal courtroom, their careers would be over.

They hired Judge Stafford Bullock of Durham County. He came to Alamance County and presided over a mock trial. Although I was not allowed to present my defence, the jury acquitted me. Judge Bullock sentenced me to life in prison.

There is much more to my story, but I don’t want to prompt corrupt prison officials to censor the P.E. journal publication. This is a Tricky Business.
