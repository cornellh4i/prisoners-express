**“Tic, Tac, Ticken in His Head” by Michael Lanning**

Luca examined his swollen cheek in the mirror. Shiny in the middle and rougher toward the edges, the bruise was a deepening purple blotch that dominated the side of his face. He touched the puffy skin and winced. “Squirrel!” he yelled to his mirror image.

Glancing over his shoulder, he saw his cellie nicknamed Blue laying on the bed and literally turning blue; he was dying. The fluorescent light lit Blue’s waxy face and emphasized the yellow tint in his eyes. As Luca watched, he could feel death swooping down on Blue in the small cell as Blue’s life drained onto the floor.

Twenty years in the Department of Corruption and Retaliation, as the prisoners call it, changed Luca forever. The system removed all hope and boiled his brain, leaving him a monster of meaninglessness. Luca’s mind is a twisted cord of malevolence and paranoia.

Tick, tick, tick goes the clock in his head. Suddenly, it was like a big movie screen with surround sound. Luca was back in 1998 at High Desert prison just after a major riot broke out on the yard. Laying proned out in the snow, he could hardly breathe from the tear gas canisters thrown by the guards. Through the thick gaseous fog, he barely made out the image of a guard in protective suit carrying one of his own.

Tick, tick, tick goes the clock in his head. Luca snapped back to reality with a gasp and found himself sitting on the chrome steels tool, seeing Blue in his death throes. Luca’s eyes dart between the cell door window and his dying cellie. Dripping blood on the floor, a blood smeared toothbrush is partially stuck in Blue’s neck. The pooled blood is the color of cooked beets, and the coppery scent permeates the cell.

Luca placed his hand on Blue’s chest. Blue convulsed, a full body seizure arching his back off the mattress and his head cranking back. Air squeezed from his lungs, a hoarse bubbling release. His eyes bulged, though looking at nothing at all. Luca felt Blue’s essence go. He leaned over Blue, and their eyes were inches from each other. There is something about death and the eyes, thought Luca. Then Blue was gone and beyond Luca’s reach. Blue’s body, the shell of his ego, went slack beneath Luca’s hand.

What should have been a somber moment brought excitement to Luca. Anxiously breathing and almost slipping in the pile of blood, he dashed to the mirror. He saw himself there dozens of times a day as he paced in the cell, but now he saw power and smiled at himself. Luca knew the mind will twist to survive and that anything can become normal. He learned prisons are filled with this sort of rationale; it isn’t so much to do something awful since the awful is simply the norm.

Then Luca felt pressure on his back. His spine stiffened, and a finger of fear touched him. He turned, and Blue’s eyes caught and held him. “Don’t,” Luca replied sharply. Blue was mute, but his eyes were watching. “Don’t,” Luca said again. Blue was watching him. Luca snatched the spoon from his shelf, stepped to the head of the bed, leaned over Blue, and scooped his eyes out like poached eggs, grey matter leaking down Blue’s dead cheek as jelly tears. The ruined eyes are no longer threatening.

Tick, tick, tick goes the clock in his head. Luca travels far away in the future to the land where the clocks have no hands.
