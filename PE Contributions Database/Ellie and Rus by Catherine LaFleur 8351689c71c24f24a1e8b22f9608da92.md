**Ellie and Rus by Catherine LaFleur**

I have two sisters, two different kinds actually. My older sisters, Patrice and Paloma, are twins. They are 17 years older than me. I was often mistaken for their baby when I was taken out by one or the other. However, they both left our family to go to college. I only got to see them on holidays or special occasions. Then they began having children of their own. I was six when I was aunted by Patrice. Even though I was the youngest of two brothers and three sisters, I had the experience of growing up as an only child because the others were so much older than me.

Way before my birth, my parents joined a religious cult in the early 1960s. For most of my childhood, we lived in communes around the world. When I turned eight, my parents were assigned to live in Arizona, and I was required to live in the children’s dormitory there. It wasn’t so bad. I had a friend, Rus, who was my age and another girl, Ellie, six years older than me who had frequently been my baby sitter. I didn’t have to live in the dorm every day. I was allowed to spend weekends in my parents’ house from Friday evening to Monday morning. During the week, I didn’t get to see my parents at all, not even if I threw a tantrum. I spent my time cocooned with my group in school and the dormitory.

Rus, Ellie, and I were in the Rachel and Leah house. There were around thirty teens and children in that dormitory. Not huge but a good size. Rus and I were inseparable. We woke up holding hands most mornings and we were break of dawn gigglers. This would wake Ellie every morning because she slept on a floor mat next to us. Ellie took care of us like we were her little chicks, making sure we got up in the morning with a routine: wash, brush, dress, hair braiding, etc. Rus and I usually chose to wear the same color dress, hair ribbons, and shoes. So Ellie had to plan accordingly. Last, we had to fold up our sleeping mats neatly and sweep and mop the floors. There was always an inspection by the dorm mother each morning and if you did not pass, you got no breakfast and extra chores. Ellie kept us and our area very clean, shiny, and neatly braided.

Between the ages of eight and twelve, all of the children were required to attend two hours of school every day beginning at 8:00 a.m. There were no teachers and us children worked at our own pace out of books. The older teenagers would tutor the younger children in the mornings then in the afternoon, they would have their own school time. I stuck like glue to Ellie and Rus. I was pretty shy.

In the afternoons, we had work assignments. Rus and I were usually assigned to the kitchen garden. We took care of weeding and cleaning the rows each day. During harvest, we had two identical small stools we perched on while picking peas, tomatoes, or strawberries and scooting up and down each row. Our voices chattered like magpies while we practiced our required scripture recitation or multiplication tables. We also sang a lot. The cult had set all the Psalms to music which is why we had that entire book memorized. We would do call and response as we worked along with plenty of giggling.

When I was seventeen, I left the cult. My mother’s parents had enough and pretty much paid a bribe to release me. I left everyone whom I had been close to or known. It was wrenching. I lost contact with Ellie and Rus, even though they also left the cult.

When I committed my crime, I was forced to stay at the jail. That turned out to be for three years. My mother rented a house and moved to that city to be close to me. While mom was out shopping one day, she ran into Ellie of all people. Unbeknownst to each of us, we had been living in the same city. After that, every week, Ellie came to see me in jail. Ellie posted on all of my details on Facebook which alerted Rus to what had happened to me. Rus started flying in to see me when she was in the States.

I have been in prison for a significant amount of time. Ellie lives in Denver and Rus is an Art Conservator in the Emirates, but my two sisters faithfully come and see me in Miami once a year. I can always count on a visit in the Summer and Winter from each of my sisters.
