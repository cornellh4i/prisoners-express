**“Some Say” by Bobby Ball**

Some say the world has changed deeply, or it is simple

Emotional intelligence becomes the Instrumental

How many love the truth now ask yourself

Will they ever pass a law and bury you right where you died at

Think about it, ain’t no vacancy

Cemetery’s overcrowded every day a life is born

You live and then you die, ain’t no surprise

Life is not permanent but it’s the longest exercise

The war is on the inside

You only a leader due to your shadow

But held hostage by your mind

Mathematics will keep you stagnated

If you miscalculate every problem that you face with

Detached from discomfort vital signs flawless

Keeping calm
