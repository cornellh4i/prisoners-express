**“In the Blink of an Eye” by David Reagan**

Harold’s sperm swam for its life. In the blink of an eye, Mirium welcomed it into safe fertilized territory. Nine months later, Mirium lay holding Harold Jr. in her eyes with love and amazement. Harold Sr. sat on the other side of the little room in a blue straight-back chair, smiling from his heart.

A year or so later, Rick came into the world. The Stump family was now complete. A larger house was in the plan. Harold Sr. worked six days a week accumulating lots of overtime. Mirium was a full-time caretaker, actually caregiver. In the 1960’s, this was referred to as housewife. Home-mother/love-giver is what Mirium was.

Harold Sr. attached a cowbell just outside the back door of his new home on Woodland Shores. The boys were kept on a short rope. They were never out of the call of the shiny brass bell. While other boys played ball, rode bikes, or shot BB guns, Buddy and Rick were visually bystanders.

One day, Buddy, Harold Jr., accidentally stepped on my foot, smashing my little toe with his three hundred forty plus pounds of baby fat.

In the blink of an eye, Buddy was a statistic on one hand and back in his mother’s arms on the other. Now, fifty years later, I say thank you to Buddy, Harold Stump Jr. and get an angry sad feeling every time I hear the Star Spangled Banner played. This usually occurs at sporting events, where most people are having way too much fun to dull their day to think of the price of their ticket. Life is precious. Death is permanent. In the blink of an eye. In the blink of an eye. In the blink of an eye.
