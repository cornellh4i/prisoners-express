**Eyes Like Daggers by Edward Homer**

****What are you looking at?

Is there something wrong with my look?

Is there something on my face?

Do I come across as a crook?

Am I not your type of race?

Jeepers creepers!

What is he looking at?

Am I the type of girl he wants?

Is it my natural grace?

Will he rape what I flaunt?

Should I take out my mace?

Jeepers creepers!

What if he looking at?!

Does he know I did last summer?!

Is this guy on my case?!

Is he working undercover?!

Should I disappear without a trace?!

Jeepers creepers!!

What the fuck are you looking?!!

Do you got something to say?!!

Donâ€™t make me pull out my Gat!!!

Stay the fuck out of my way!!!

Jeepers creepers, you best put away those peepers!

The eyes can portray a thousand words.

Provoke friendship, love, insecurity, violence, paranoia, and anything absurd.

Get a pair of sunglasses.
