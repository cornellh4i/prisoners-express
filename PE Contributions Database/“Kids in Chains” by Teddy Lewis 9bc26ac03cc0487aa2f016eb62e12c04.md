**“Kids in Chains” by Teddy Lewis**

This is our block o.k. This is where we live o.k. The families that are here are strict, fortunate, clean and modest. As kids we play for most of the day with no worries because here is a world outside of a world, yet a world within one. He is 8 years old. I am 9. Every day of our young life we’re usually right here and the joy of our lives is priceless. If a picture is worth 1000 words then make it 1000z. One for each of us o.k. You promise. We decided to cover our faces because our mothers are overprotective yet cautious for the unknown which you the reader must understand. The twist and turns of being a kid at times is indescribable yet at the end of the day you got to love. We do.

Peace
