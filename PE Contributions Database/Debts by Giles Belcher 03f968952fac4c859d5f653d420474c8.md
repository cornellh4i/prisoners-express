**Debts by Giles Belcher**

Being in debt, especially to anyone, is hard to avoid. It can be to the Feds, that’s given, the state, whether in prison, or in life on the streets.

In prison, you can and will owe the state, a gang, or a person in general. Very few can say that they don’t owe anyone anything period. That is a rare accomplishment to do in SCDC! You can and do owe DNA, medical, legal, and other fees levied by the powers to be over you. Heck, you may owe and not know that you anything until you are close to moving out or just get a money slip! That’s SCDC for you! Stealing money is the name of the game here! Hell, the state owes the state in that quagmire they have created! “Ha! Ha!” Shucks, I owe the state DNA, medical, legal mail, and child support! Locked up for 15 years and 10 more to go. It’s going to be a garnishment of pay cheches, wages, and possible taking of property if it comes down to paying off debts! Life sucka at times, but it’s life! Enjoy life while you can!
