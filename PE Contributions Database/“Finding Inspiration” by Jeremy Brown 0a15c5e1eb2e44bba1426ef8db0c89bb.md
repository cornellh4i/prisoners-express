**“Finding Inspiration” by Jeremy Brown**

Outside of myself External Images penetrate the mind’s perception.

This visual Cortex receives The Input of Light Spectrums. Photons of light forming, restructuring in The Third Eye of Consciousness. Vibrations of Color Frequencies embodied in the Auric field. Emanation. Divine Sensation. Empathic Psychic collaboration. Between what is seen, what is felt, subtle the unseen arises and manifests into the inspiration of The Supreme Infinite Imagination.

World collides, Different Themes coincide, I make my stride.

Continuum, Continuation, Nothing more, Nothing less.

Ass Blessed Be in Eternity,

Human purpose, Constructive Creation,

This is Finding Divine Sublime Inspiration.
