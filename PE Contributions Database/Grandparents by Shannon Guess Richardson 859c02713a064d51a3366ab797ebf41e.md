Grandparents by Shannon Guess Richardson

My grandparents were such an essential part of my life. I was abandoned by my mother when I was 2 years old, so my grandmother (my father’s mother) was the closest thing I had to a mother growing up. She helped to shape me into the woman I am today

As much as I love and adore my grandmother, I want to tell you about my grandfather. I longed to know him growing up. This was the man my father, his sister, and his brothers had written out of their lives, long before I was born.

My grandparents had 4 children. My grandfather had an unfortunate temper. From what I have been told, it didn’t take much to set him off. When he was angry, he lashed out by beating both my grandmother and all of their children. He preferred using his belt, but was not opposed to using his hands. Unfortunately, my father inherited both his father’s temperament as well as his method of “punishment.”

Eventually, my grandmother couldn’t take anymore. She moved herself and her 4 children to her aunt’s house while her husband was at work. Rather than taking this as a cue to clean up his act, he moved away. He left them all behind and they didn’t hear from him for many years.

My grandfather eventually got himself together. He stopped drinking. He had a good respectable job that he eventually retired from. He had gotten control over himself and his temper.

By the time he made contact with his children, they wanted nothing to do with him. He tried to make up for his actions and wanted nothing more than to start over with them. They didn’t feel the same way. They couldn’t/wouldn’t forgive him.

I knew all of this, but it didn’t matter to me. I wanted to know my grandfather. My father refused. He said I could contact his “sperm donor” when I was no longer in his house.

My grandmother tried to help me in my endeavor to know my grandfather. She allowed me to stay in contact with my aunts (my grandfather’s sisters), Lovella and Estelle. They visited me at her house and we wrote letters that were sent through her address. They told me stories about him and told me all about him. I was fascinated by this mystery person that was my grandfather.

When I moved out and had my own child, I immediately got my grandfather’s address from my aunts and sent him a letter. I honestly didn’t think he would respond. Not only did he write me back, he drove from Colorado to Georgia to meet me and his great grandson.

The person I met was not the same person that had been described to me by my father. He had such a light about him; you couldn’t help but be happy when you were around him. He had the sweetest and most gentle nature. My son and I absolutely adored him.

I tried to get the rest of my family to see him, but they refused. My heart broke for him. I wanted him to know his children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and even my grandmother. I made a scrapbook and included pictures, histories, and funny stories about each person. I was told he treasured that book until he died. It was returned to me when he died-- it was well worn and used.

I am so thankful I had a chance to meet and grow close to my grandfather. Horrace Rogers gives me hope for humanity. He taught me that people really can change. People can do horrible things and still have a beautiful heart. They say people don’t change. My grandfather is proof to me that they are wrong.
