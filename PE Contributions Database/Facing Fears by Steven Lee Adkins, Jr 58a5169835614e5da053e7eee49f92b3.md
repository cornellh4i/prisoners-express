****As is with everything, exposure leads to familiarity and is essential in overcoming and facing fear. Once fear is faced and then overcome, courage is obtained. Once certain levels are achieved, a detached or dulled perception is unavoidable.

To a certain degree, fear is valuable and can be progressive/positive. Those higher levels can hinder this, if not eradicate it completely. Balance is needed. If not faced at all, it can rule supreme and render a soul with great potential into a coward. Cowards are weak, and if there are any entities who respect the weak, they are unknown to me.

Facing fear releases negative pressure and reduces stress, sometimes completely. This action brings positiveness, pride, and satisfaction and advances the person to a better knowledge and confidence of self. Levels and experiences cannot be skipped and still gain progression.

Facing fear and enduring what layed mysteriously out of view is the only way to proceed. The weak are attracted to the strong. Cowards are envious of the bold. No amount of forced exposure of the weak upon the strong can change their positions, and no amount of ill intent from the cowardly toward the bold can overcome the greatness of the bold. Their roles will remain the same.
