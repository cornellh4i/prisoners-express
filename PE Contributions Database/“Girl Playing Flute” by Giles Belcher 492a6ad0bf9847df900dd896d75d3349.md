**“Girl Playing Flute” by Giles Belcher**

I hear a beautiful melody drifting in the wind. I’ve been walking in the woods for a while. Stopping to hear which direction the music is coming from. I walk towards the area from where the melody is coming from. I see a young girl, with long red hair, having an animal skin, possibly a bobcat fur draped over one shoulder. The flute is wooden, having fringed leather strips hanging off of it. A jingling of bells I now hear and see dangling from the flute. I must be quiet to not startle her. I am enraptured by the melody being played. Possibly folk, Native American tune, I don’t know? I just know it is a beautiful and haunting melody she is playing. The wind lightly fluttering leaves carries the melody easily. I wonder if the wood itself knows of the music being played for its benefit! I must move on. Though I want to stay! Peace and harmony in the woods, music drifting on the wind.
