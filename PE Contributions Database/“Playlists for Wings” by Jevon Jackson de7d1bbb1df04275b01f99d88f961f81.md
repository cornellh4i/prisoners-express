**“Playlists for Wings” by Jevon Jackson** 

About 18 years ago, in the Wisconsin prison system, we used to be allowed to buy music cassette tapes. Then one day, the arbitrary psychological guillotine fell on us all and the administration issued a memo giving us 30 days to get rid of the cassette tapes or face discipline, as the tapes would no longer be allowed. Being an avid music lover, this was a very distressing ordeal for me. It was as if someone had crossbowed me out of the sky, a gathering of arrows pierced through the plumage of my wings.

Music gave me this natural high that was unlike any other allowable privilege in prison. I could put my headphones on, insert Sade’s “Love Deluxe” into my tape deck and be transported high into the crystal blue sky. Drowning out all the chatter-noise and the fickle chaos of the cell hall, shedding the heavy prison stresses for a moment, I could delightfully get caught up in the seam of a jazzy mellow baseline. I could become weightless.

There was absolutely no way I could willingly hand over my cassette tapes. After the 30-day deadline, I began hiding my tapes as best as I could throughout the rest of my property. To no avail, within a month or two, the tapes were confiscated by staff during a major cell search. I can’t remember what the penalty was, but I’m sure it was minor. More importantly to me, my wings had been clipped and I was stuck listening to the sparse collection of radio stations that we had available. I have gotta be straight-up, no matter how good your favorite radio station is, radio play just sucks overall. The DJ’s talk too much, too many commercials, and it’s usually the same 40 or so songs in constant rotation. Listening to radio stations is no comparison to listening to the specific artists that you enjoy the most, your own cultivated library of music. But radio play was all I had, so I had to learn to enjoy it.

Then last year, the Wisconsin prison system did something I never thought would happen. They allowed us to buy our own digital tablet devices. The devices allow us to send/receive emails, play games, and most importantly to me, buy the specific kind of music that we wanted. One of the very first songs I bought was Sade’s “Morning bird.” Using most of my meager 19 cents an hour pay as a janitor, I gradually gathered a song here and there - $1.95 for each song - until I had a nice, smoothed out playlist that I could enjoy endlessly. Songs like Maxwell’s “Pretty Wings”, Chaka Khan’s “Angel”, Sara Bareilles’ “Gravity”, Brandi Carlile’s “Rise Again”, Jimi Hendrix’s “Sweet Angel,”, etc… Incarcerated since Bill Clinton’s first term, the touch-screen technology was all new to me. And I was happy to see that all I had to do was press the shuffle icon on my music app and it would play throughout the songs randomly. No more flipping cassette tapes for me.

One day recently, with my brand new closed-ear headphones blocking out the noise around me, I walked around the courtyard track outside the unit; the bright August sun breaking through the midday clouds, guys scattered about, some playing half-court basketball, some sitting and playing cards on old picnic beaches, and others leaning against the wall of the building in conversation. As I walked around the small oval track, I found myself completely lost in the music. I had abandoned my physical body and risen high into the calm blue ether. I was coasting above the stratus clouds, consumed within the cloister of a chord progression. And then asn alto riff would take me higher into the sky.

Suddenly, as I bent the curve of the smooth pavement, facing the building, I looked up and was surprised to see that everyone was gone except for two stern-faced guards standing next to the opened door. Apparently, they had closed the courtyard and I didn’t hear the announcement over the loud-speaker. Removing my headphones as I approached the guards and the opened door, one of the guards jokingly said to me, “we were waiting to see how long it would take you to realize that everyone went in.”

“Yeah,” I said, smiling and tapping my headphones with my index finger, “I guess I got a little too caught up in the clouds.”
