**“My Sister Is Special” by Anthony Kenley**

I only have one sister and her name is Mindy. I think she is special. She started life that way and just built on that going forward.

My older brother was four. I was three and my little brother was one when my sister was born in my parents' bedroom at home. Had to be different and special from the beginning. She's a textan born, she that makes her special too.

My mother died of leukaemia shortly after my sister was born. I learned later in life, my mother had the choice of treatment that would save her life and kill my sister or she could deliver my sister but not save herself. My sister was special enough to save according to the choice made. So my sister is special.

My father remarried and our family expanded with foster brothers. Up to eight boys and one girl. She was the odd one out. She was the youngest and the only girl too. Boy! She was pampered and spoiled and treated so special.

My sister always wanted to be included in what the boys were doing. Going exploring and playing in the hay barn or whatever. 	We didn’t have much use for a sister. We weren’t included in her stuff so, return the favor.

It turns out sisters are helpful in one good way. They help a man relate to daughters in future life.

Family troubles occurred when she was nine. My family was split apart and my sister was adopted away from us boys. A doctor and his family thought my sister was special enough to call theirs.	It took seventeen years to see her again. Mindy came to Texas to visit and reunite with us, her brothers.

I learned she had moved with her new family to the north and become a Yankee. Ain’t that special! Hearing a Rhode Island accent come from my sister’s mouth was hilarious to me.

My sister had followed our family tradition and served an enlistment in the United States Armed Forces. She chose the Navy. There are so many jokes available there.

I discovered my sister had three tattoos and their meaning to her. Awesome! Tattooed chicks are cool! After seventeen years, it’s more of a cool friend than a sister.

I took my sister out honky tonkin’. Mam! She was a spectacle on the dance floor. Red silk shirt and black slacks in heels. I’m prejudiced, but she was absolutely beautiful too. I’m pretty sure they figured her out for an out-of-state. They wouldn’t have believed she started out Texan. That evening was special. I’d pay good money to know the conversations she had back home.

We were sitting around talking and a female country singer named Mindy came on the radio. I told my sister all these years each time I heard that singer I thought of her. Mindy told me, night back, all these years, she wondered if when I heard that singer, I thought of her because of the name Mindy? Great minds think alike.

After she returned home, I used her tattoos as inspiration for a couple of nice poems I did for her. I sent them to her to let her know I still think of her and she’s special to me. I'm thankful I have a sister. Mindy is special to me.
