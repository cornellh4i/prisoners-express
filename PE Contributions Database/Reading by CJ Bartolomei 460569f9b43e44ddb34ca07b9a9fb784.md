**"Reading" by CJ Bartolomei**

Reading is the most essential educational activity for the advancement of our lives. Our intelligence depends on it! Reading the newspapers, magazines, comic strips, comic books, sacred scriptures, religious tracts, propaganda, lexicons of all sorts, thesauruses, encyclopedias, almanacs, volumes of books upon books, fiction, non-fiction, mystery, suspense, crime, psychology, criminology, comedy, anthropology, sorcery, spirituality, religious, educational, historical, instructional, sports reviews, autobiographies, biographies, records and stats, reports of monumental plays of records made in history, olympics and competitive events since the beginning of time that men kept track of. There’s something we can read about somewhere, but it’s up to us to seek it out and find it and get our peace of mind right into that solemn place to take a step back and just read into the texts left for us to ingest into our ever growing minds and lives. Reading out loud will give you more understanding and grasp on the material you are reading. To read out loud is to empower the reader and to read out loud to others is to give them the message to be understood, to learn, to know, and to be known as a reader.

You can be a studious reader and take notes while reading one book or many books at once, notes strewn about your book or desk or floor reading reference materials and notes. You can be an active reader: reading many different materials throughout the day, every day as if the day were set in periods like at school where there are several periods a day, so you’ll read several different books throughout the live long day. With active reading, you could walk and read, silently or out loud, yet fully conscientious of the traffic in your surroundings. You could do leg yoga and read while laying in your bunk (it’s the best!), you could read between repetitions of calisthenics (scriptures are best for this!), most definitely want to bring a magazine or tract with you to medical because you know you’ll be in the waiting room, and who wants to participate in gawd awful gossip sessions of backbiting nonsense?! READ! Reading will save you from suffering.
