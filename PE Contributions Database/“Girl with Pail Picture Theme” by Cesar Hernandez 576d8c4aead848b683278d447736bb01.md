**“Girl with Pail Picture Theme” by Cesar Hernandez**

Nothing in this world is absolutely still. Everything is moving and changing. Due to impermanence, our happiness can’t last forever - it can turn into suffering at any moment.

Anything impermanent is subject to falling apart. Falling apart is not happiness. Therefore what is impermanent is said to be suffering.

Once, there was a young and headstrong princess, pampered by her father the king. No matter what she wanted, the king would do whatever he could to fulfill her wishes. One day it was raining hard, and when the rain spattered on the puddles in the palace yard, it made lots of bubbles, which fascinated the princess so much that she told the king, “I want a garland of water bubbles to adorn my hair.”

The king answered, “That’s impossible.”

The princess insisted, saying that if she didn’t get what she wanted she would die. The king was frightened and convened all the artisans in the kingdom, commanding them to make a garland of water bubbles for the princess. Many young artisans were at their wit’s end and extremely anxious for fear of the princess’s disappointment.

One old craftsman claimed that he could do what she wanted on the condition that the princess be his consultant. The king was overjoyed and sent his daughter to the craftsman’s workshop. The craftsman told the princess, “I can make the garland, but I can’t tell nice water bubbles from ugly ones. Please bring me the ones you want, and then I will make them into a garland for you.”

The princess happily agreed and went to choose her water bubbles, but even after trying for a long time, she couldn’t catch a single one. Exhausted, she turned around and ran into the palace to tell her father, “Water bubbles are very pretty, but when I try to catch them, they don’t even last a moment. I don’t want them anymore.”

Suffering is rooted in clinging. The more deeply you realize the law of impermanence, the less overwhelming your suffering will be. If, for instance, you understand the impermanence of life, you can recover from the le vestetran of a loved one’s death.

The moon waxes and wanes, dim and bright, likewise, people can become happy or sad, together of seperated. This is the law of impermanence, and nobody can transcend it. If you understand this, your mind will open, and change won’t drive you to despair.
