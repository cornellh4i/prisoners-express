**Debts of Our Lives by Thomas J. Combs**

When the cell doors slammed shut behind me and I found myself in the suicide watch pod, I didn’t know what to expect. I only understood that I had been moved to the “Walnut Tier” where all the crazies were. The cell stank - mostly from a dead rat floating in the toilet. It took several flushes to send it spinning down. I was in the worst of the worst…

The yelling went back and forth, all the time, and it seemed like the whole tier had gone berserk. So while I was cleaning out my cell, I listened and learned about the people around me. I heard everybody’s name at least once, I learned what they accused each other of being in prison for, which psych medications they were on, and which of them were racist.

There were no rules like on most tiers. There wasn’t even a difference between night and day. They could be as crazy as they wanted to be, say anything they wanted, do anything they wanted, and disrespect anyone they pleased … including the prison guards, who saw the uselessness in writing disciplinary charges for any of the rule violations. In a way this was the prisoners’ own tier, and nobody had anything to say about it.

“Where did all these crazy people come from?” I wandered. When you listened it seemed as though everyone was hollering, but as I listened, I realized that only six or seven of the seventeen inmates on the tier were yelling.

There were no windows in the cells nor the pod, making it utterly impossible to determine night and day. There was also no clock to check the time. The only way to tell it was daytime was the serving of breakfast and dinner.

Because this was the watch pod, we were all naked except for a yellow dresslike smock. When they fed, the meals were only sack lunches as we could not be given silverware. We were given 3 sandwiches for breakfast consisting of 2 ham sandwiches and 1 peanut butter sandwich. We were served this for breakfast 7 days a week. 3 days out of the week we were given milk with our breakfast sandwiches, but we had to gulp it down in front of the guards and immediately give back the carton. Dinner, the same everyday, was two bologna sandwiches and no drink.

I don’t know how long it took me to get settled into my new living situation or how long the yelling had been going on for before I turned to the front of my cell and saw an old man roaming around on the tier. He acted as if he was lost. His light gray shirt, tan khaki slacks and green/black sneakers told me he wasn’t a fellow convict. “Who in the hell is he? And how in the hell did he get out of his cell on the most secure cell block in all of Arizona’s Maximum Security Prison?” I wondered.

The old man slowly turned my way and inched up to my cell door. “Hi Cell 6,” he seemed glad to say, “please forgive me, but I forgot my glasses this morning, and I’m having problems locating cell numbers. How are you today?” he asked, and then went on talking. “I have some new stuff for you. I got your note about the side effects, so I want you to try these.”

“Hold on a minute!” I interrupted. “Are you sure you’re talking about me? Who are you anyway? I don’t think you have the right cell.”

“I’m one of the prison psychiatrists,” he said. “ This is cell fifty-nine, isn’t it?” Then taking a step back and squinting at the number above, he smiled.

“Yeah, yeah!” he said. “I got your note about Thorazine and the side effects. Not too many people like them, but here, I want you to try these.”

The psychiatrist reached into his inside pocket and pulled out several multicolored syringes. I was speechless. I never thought I’d see a psychiatrist carrying syringes in the pocket of his coat.

“Gee, these will definitely make you feel better up the road,” he said, “but aren’t for you now. What I do have for you,” he mumbled, “let’s see… they must be in one of my other pockets…”

“Hold on! Hold on, Doc!” I said. “I’m not on any medication… I know you don’t have the right person here.”

“What’s your last name and number?”

“Combs, 280904,” I answered quickly.

“Well, well, my man must have been transferred,” he resolved, scratching his butt, and walked away down the tier.

Not long after I’d been relocated, the evening chow cart came rolling down the tier. The guards started with the end cell and moved toward the front. They unlocked each cell’s food trap and gave the prisoner whatever portion for his meal. Today was Mexican food, the worst.

When the cart was just a few cells away from mine, I saw a hand lunge out of an open port and fling a milk carton of urine and feces into the faces of the guards serving the food. It took a few seconds before I could believe my eyes. The guards stood there with the feces dripping, their serving spatulas still in their hands. Then a maniacal laugh broke the silence.

“Eat my shit! I saved that from yesterday when you punks wouldn’t give me no shitwipe. Now both of you can just eat it!”

“You’ll pay for this,” one of the guards said calmly, and the two of them hurried off the tier with the food cart.

“You did it now! You cracked off (used instead of another derogatory word) all the damn food, Ed!” said Joe.

“Hey, you mean we don’t get to eat tonight?” I asked.

“Yeah, you’ll eat,” he said, “if you want to eat off a cart with Ed’s shit all over it.”

“You ain’t serious, are you?”

Listen, man. We don’t have nothin’ comin’ tonight! That’s the bottomline, not unless you wanna eat Ed’s shit!”

About an hour later I heard what sounded like an army of guards preparing to enter the tier: there were lots of keys jingling and the sound of plastic clanking against the walls

Then a dozen Guards marched past my cell dressed in full armored gear, with helmets, batons, and riot shields held tightly to their chests. The unit sergeant had a stun gun and several other guards carried pump-action shotguns loaded with rubber bullets that can severely disabled a person. They haphazardly pulled along the emergency gurney on wheels behind them.

They gathered in front of Ed’s cell. I stood close to my cell door, I could just barely see out of my window down the tier to where they were. The unit sergeant had opened the food port, then shouted the order for Ed to step to his cell door immediately to be handcuffed.

“Are you going to cuff up?” he demanded.

Ed’s quick response was, “Yes, sir! I don’t want any problems. I am fully cooperating. I am not resisting.”

“That’s not fast enough,” said the sergeant. He stepped aside to give the gunman a clear shot into the food trap of Ed’s cell. The gun blasts roared as they bounced off the walls of the enclosed tier. Pow! Pow! Then the electric cell door came open, and the guards rushed inside. The whole tier heard the beating and Ed’s screams. I could smell his flesh burning from the stun device.

They went on beating him until the screams stopped and their kicks and punches sounded like thuds on a corpse.

“Throw his ass on the gurney,” the sergeant ordered. The guards threw Ed on the gurney, his arms and legs lifelessly hanging as he flew through the air, landing roughly on the gurney.

When they finally managed to flop all of Ed’s limbs onto the gurney, then began rolling off the tier. Suddenly, a guard called, “Wait a minute,” and picked something up from the floor. “Here’s some of the bastard’s teeth,” he said, and threw them onto the gurney. I will never forget the sound they made, like dice being thrown against the wooden ledge.

There were no witnesses to this other than us inmates, but we were nobodies. Later the guards mopped up the blood. The tier stayed quiet the rest of the evening, and there was no mention of dinner.

I stayed in the “Watch Pod” for close to 60 days and Ed never returned, but that’s usually how it turned out when the guards “rolled” you. Besides I could tell Ed lost his life that evening when I watched as the guards pushed that gurney off the tier, because his body lay slack and motionless, void of all forms of life. Just another convict to pay his debt to society with his own life, for what? Inconsequential reasons.
