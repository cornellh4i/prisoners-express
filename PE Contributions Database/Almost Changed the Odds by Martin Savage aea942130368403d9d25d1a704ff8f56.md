**“Almost Changed the Odds” by M.C.S**

****Growing up black, you’re assailed by a seemingly endless stream of statistics that are supposed to be relevant to you. Like computational oracles of the “black future,” co-mingling the possibilities of every brown skinned human into one set of possibilities, these statistics end up dictating the flow of your life, if you let them. When I read the word “almost,” and searched for its significance in my own life, I came up with this: I almost defied the statistics.

As a young child I was a straight-A student. My formative years instilled in me that special sort of confidence one only gains by consistently surpassing the expectations of those around you, by always being the one able to help his peers understand the world. Even later, when I struggled in advanced placement classes, or succumbed to adolescent malaise and stopped caring about school, I still had it in my head that I wasn’t one of those kids “destined” for bad ends. Even though my family was poor, even though we lived in an area of high crime, even though I grew up in a single parent household, had no strong male role model and my mother was a drug addict, I was raised in such a way that I was never entangled by those things and grew up relatively well adjusted. I managed to get work with the federal government while in high school, and by time I was 21, I had a job with the Department of Defense, my own place, and had no problems with relationships, drugs, money or the law.

In the back of my mind there was always some smug satisfaction that I was not conforming to the statistical stereotype of the underprivileged black male. My father and my uncles had been to prison but they expected me to be different. My friends smoked, drank and fought like crazy but made a point of keeping me out of those things. Everyone expected the best out of me and conspired to help me achieve great things and I came to judge how well I was meeting those expectations by comparing myself to the bleak statistical statement of how my life should be.

This is not to say I never got in any trouble or never did anything wrong or against the rules, but it was never anything serious enough to suggest a philosophy that would lead me to repeat those deeds. The one exception to this was a secret, a behavior that grew from a skewed perception of right and wrong in one area of life that I was never expected to discuss and would not have known how to discuss anyway. If I had revealed it to anyone who cared about me, I know now that they would have helped me. But, admitting to such serious wrongdoing felt impossible to me. Instead, I lived a life that on the surface was squeaky clean, but in private was marred by confusion and shame.

When the day came that the police knocked on my door, I knew that life as I had known it was over. I knew that I had managed to fall short of all the expectations. Despite the faith my family and friends had in me, despite overcoming a myriad of other obstacles and defying the odds in so many ways, I had become just another black man in jail--just another statistic.

Ultimately, I accept that I needed this intervention and earned these consequences. I might have self-corrected my behavior given time, but it unlikely I would have ever been able to identify the logical fallacies upon which my behavior was based without receiving outside help. My familial and fraternal bonds have also been strengthened as so many people have stood by me and supported me. I understand after years of reflection that a statistical correlation says nothing about who a person is. Still, I had lived believing that my life would change the odds for those who would come after, so that the statistics they’d see would paint a rosier picture of what they could expect from life and grant them confidence. All I can say now is that I almost managed to do it.
