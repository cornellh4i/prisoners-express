**“Afraid to Live” by Monica Ullom**

I’m looking out the window towards the city below. For so many years looking out all I did was behold. I sat shackled up, behind fences and bars, state-issued clothes, hygiene, and drawers.

Month after month I dreamt of what I’d do one day. if only I could leave… I’d party, I’d tear up the town. No one could hold me down.

Now I’m free technically, yet I’m not venturing out, I’m uneasy. I look at the city below from my window, dressed and looking fine, yet, here I am sitting down cause “It’s count time.” In my mind I know I don't have that guard over me anymore but how do you stop something you’ve done month after month? How do you embrace freedom, when you haven't been free? How do you see the city and feel like “hey, now it includes me”.

I was locked away and set aside for many, many moons, I became an “offender”, a number, merely a soul to fill a bed. Now I can see this city. I can go out, dance, and be carefree. Just tell me how I can shut off what the state wanted me to be? Quiet, submissive, a robot if you will, only to come home and realize they molded me into a hermit. City, I’m afraid of you sitting in my window sill.
