Breakfast was my favorite time. My mother was dying and she wanted to teach me to cook. So that when I became a man could survive on my own when I lost her and I had no one. So where would she start? Dinner would be too complex. Too many ingredients and timekeeping. A shake, a finger shake, a sprinkle, a twist.

Much too much.

Lunch, maybe? Baloney sandwiches? Peanut butter and Jelly? Not enough rocket science. An insult to my palate.

Ahhh breakfast. The important meal. The time that can set your WHOLE day. A dash of sweet, a smile, a laugh. Delicious.

Special omelette with onions and spices, honeyed toast, fruits and juice. And the smells... mmm aaaah.

A wonderful meal. Not difficult. Not a Sunday morning stroll. Pancakes: just right: thick and fluffy, sweet enough. Humectant with syrup. A veritable reminder of Heaven made edible.

Then I experimented. With spices, with cheese. She loved cheese. So did I. So I made her an omelette of 3 cheeses.

One nice and drippy, the other smooth and warm, the third dark and crunchy. Layers.

A veritable reminder.

She loved it. So did I.

Now I thank her. Though I have to use prayer to do so. She taught me that angels love breakfast, even before they become angels.

And it can be so heavenly.

JOKE

“Are you sure you’re a virgin?” The new husband asked his bride on their honeymoon.

“Of course I am,” she relied rather indignantly, “ask any one of my kids.”
