Haircuts. They can make us feel like we are on top of the world or send even a child into depression. In some cases, they can scar us for life.

Being raised by my father, I was a prissly little princess. I had long, auburn hair that I adored. Unfortunately, I was extremely tender-headed. Even more unfortunate was my father’s impatience.

I spent summer breaks with my grandmother in Piedmont, Alabama. The summer following kindergarten is one I’ll never forget--ever--because my father told my grandmother to take me to my cousin’s barber shop and have *all* my hair cut off. He wanted me to have the typical little boy helmet head haircut. She tried to change his mind, but it was already set: if she didn’t take me, he would.

I remember sitting in the chair thinking I was going to get a trim. After thinking about everything but my hair (which isn’t hard for a little girl with ADHD), I was allowed to turn to the mirror… I fell to the floor, screaming as though someone had just killed my best friend. I refused to leave until I had a bag to place over my head. I’d wear that bag the entire summer, simmering in a depressed state.

When first grade started, a parent of one of my friends looked at me and commented, “What a cute little boy!” I like to look for silver linings, and if I had to find one in that traumatic experience, it would be that I got my ears pierced and got a wardrobe of nothing but dresses that weekend.

To this day, I cannot stand to have my haircut, and I will not let them turn me away from the mirror. Isn’t it amazing how much power is in a simple haircut?
