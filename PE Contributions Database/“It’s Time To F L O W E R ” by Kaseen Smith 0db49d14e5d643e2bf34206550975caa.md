**“It’s Time To F.L.O.W.E.R.” by Kaseen Smith**

“Join us”, the man in, what I assume is, army attire, says and hands me a pamphlet and walks away … leaving the door to curiosity completely unobstructed. With a very outspoken design, the cover in bold print reads as follows: It’s Time To F.L.O.W.E.R. the planet.

Interested at this point I read on … It’s time to Fight Land Oppressors Wherever Evilness Roams (F.L.O.W.E.R.). Obviously, their objective is to secure my attention in order for me to read on but, paranoia got the better of me. I immediately stop in order to look around to see if others have received the pamphlet. From my perspective, I see none.

Walking to a coffee shop with it concealed deep inside my jacket pocket.... I order a regular coffee with two creamers and five sugars, as well as a toasted blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese. Making my way to the far corner… seated, I disarm what’s been hidden and begin to read.

Instantly I was put in a state of absolute befuddlement due to the pamphlet addressing me personally. “How?” I reasoned within myself. “Was I selected? Am I the only one?” As I look around from my perspective - I am.

You’re probably wondering why I chose not to disclose what was written. In my opinion, it would be pointless if you’re just going to read it but not follow through…

Rising to my feet, humbled, I search for those in need. Spreading love is the key, please take heed. It is what we were created to do… unlike some, who have become so numb.
