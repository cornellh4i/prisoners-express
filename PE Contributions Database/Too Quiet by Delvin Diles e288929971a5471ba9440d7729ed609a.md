**Too Quiet by Delvin Diles**

Being forced to wait on picket bosses and gatekeepers to push a button for a cell ingress used to piss me off. Bad. I’d fry “C’mon dude!! You got ONE job! Open the F***** door!!” Sometimes aloud, which would usually result in a longer wait.

After a couple decades, I reasoned: If I’m going from locked space to locked space, why am I in a hurry? I became an expert at waiting in silence. Some C.D., in a booth or at a gate, wants to stall? That’s cool. I’ll wait. Look around and wait. Breathe and wait. Listen to an imagined playlist of “Wonder Wall”, “Clocks”, etc… and wait.

In my first year on this unit after a transfer, I expect some C.D.s to test my patience. I wasn’t surprised to be the only inmate standing in the hallway waiting on a door guard to finish his conversation with a picket boss. I was in the middle of the 2nd verse of “My Immortal” when he looked my way with a start as if he’d just noticed me. “Yeah, right” I thought.

As I walked through the doorway he actually reprimanded me for waiting quietly. “So you were just gonna stand there? Why didn’t you say something?”

Throwing up my hand, I told him, “Hey man, I’m just an inmate trying to go back to my pod.”

Then he called me to the bars and in a solemn African accent informed me “You are not an inmate. You are a human being. If you had said something, I would have opened the door.”

Maybe sometimes I’m too quiet.
