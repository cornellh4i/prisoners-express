I can’t say that I was arrested and brought to prison. Arrested isn’t the right word: I was most definitely rescued from the streets, my lifestyle, drugs, and most of all, myself. This is a very painful topic, and one I’ve not taken time to share with those around me for fear of judgement and misunderstanding.

I was 15 years old when I first got sent off. I went from training school, straight to prison. I was 20 years old when I got out. I tried my first hard drug at a hotel party. Crystal meth, alcohol, and my friends was all I had.

Meth opened doors to cocaine use, which eventually led to shooting up. After 4 or 5 years on the two uppers I moved on to heroin. I grew up in a home with addicts, convicts, drugs, violence, and so much more. Naturally, I followed suit. I had a chance to be different, but squandered those opportunities looking to party. After years of drug abuse, addictions, lust-filled relationships, and lots of broken dreams and hearts, I ended up with every bridge burnt, every back turned, and just me and my lost group of friends who all shared one goal. Getting high just to deal with our guilt-ridden minds, souls, and bodies.

The fun faded, and what once was cool, fun, and exciting, turned into sad depressing, and a terrible habit that was disgusting and humiliating.

I tried to run away to different states and start over. I tried finding new friends. I tried detox and rehab. I attempted suicide. Deep inside, I didn’t want it. After years of living dangerously, I ended up in a house with four girls who sold their bodies, four others who shoplifted, and one who robbed and stole. At this point the fun had been gone. It was pure survival at this point. I wanted help, but I wasn’t ready to change, nor was i committed to trying.

However, I was completely exhausted and was sick of my bullshit and my life. When it all came crashing down and the waves engulfed my body, I was under the influence of a couple of grams of coke, a couple of grams of heroin, 11 blue xanax, and 1/5th of Jose Cuervo Gold, and my girlfriend was selling herself to a friend of mine. After all that, we went out to a party.

My cousin got slapped by a friend, and I lost complete control of who I was and what I was doing. After flipping out on everybody I finally sat down with a bloody knife in my possession. A friend of mine dead, and the police calling my phone.

When the dust had settled I had robbed my cousin, beat up my girlfriend, and killed my friend. I told the blue where I was and what I had done step by step. My life was completely out of control, and I hated the monster I had become.

When the Police came to rescue me from the world and myself, I fully submitted and manned up to accept full responsibility. I am not some cold-blooded killer. I am not a bad person. I just made decisions to ride the wrong roads. I fully accept my fate, and I’m finally sober. The death was truly an accident, and God has allowed me a release date and another chance at life. To date, I have been sober for 3.5 years, obtained a GED, enrolled in several classes here in the prison for college credits. I’ve learned a lot about who I am and what I like to do. I’ve discovered this writing program, which allows me to express myself, without judgement.

I’m doing everything I can to learn about the real me and stay busy trying to find my purpose. This rescue has truly opened my eyes to the most wonderful things in life, and to the best people I’ve ever met.

For once in my life, I feel compassion for my fellow man. Even though I’m incarcerated, I’m truly happy. I look happily, every morning, at the rescued man God allowed me to become. I’m not perfect by any means, but I’m finally happy and I have peace in my heart. I have a family that has forgiven me, and loves me unconditionally, and I know what it feels like to be rescued.
