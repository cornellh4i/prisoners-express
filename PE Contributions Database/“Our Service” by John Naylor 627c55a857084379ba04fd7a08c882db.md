**“Our Service” by John Naylor**

When I was with the Sons of American Legion we had to recite the preamble at meetings. It’s on the back of everyone’s card. Service to the Community, State and Nation is a big theme. Though I’ve been out of post #608 for some time due to circumstances beyond my control I haven’t changed for the worse. If anything, my community involvement is even stronger. You can help out someone by writing a piece for Prisoner Express. You can help out by sharing a resource list address where free books are available. So many institutions lack education or anything stimulating to the mind. People will suffer without mental stimulation. Some of us remember doing time in other institutions. Doing time before personal TVs. Or even dayroom TV for that matter. The institutions were off the hook then. One thing that did seem richer was the relationship or quality of rapport with other convicts. Men were talkers sure, but many were listeners. There was a higher sense of community. People learned from each other. They taught their own foolishness or how to be more foolish yourself. Sometimes those teachings are one in the same. Our addictions can be so tough our whole lives are structured around it. It used to make us happy.

It’s what we thought we wanted. No I don’t mean coffee. You with your blackened mug. Real substances. Are you part of the circle? What’s goin’ around? Hey, you know those conversations. They get straight to the point fast, talk later. Let’s get that right first. Then we’ll talk. Or at least until we peak. Then it gets to an old saying. “Then it gets real fuckin’ quiet.” Or maybe it picks up and you’ve gotta put the toilet paper up. Yes, I remember the old days too. Part of what gives a sense of community in “the circle” is helping out. The activities and even negativity never stopped some degree of that. Neither should sobriety or prisons torturous discomforts in general. If helping out built a sense of community then it can now, too. Just remember that if it’s hard because of a drought and you’re miserable, others are too. Do not get hustled and pimped. You don’t have to. You just have to help out. It doesn’t have to be monetary. I think you’ll find you’re happier for doing so. It’s another way of the greatest chemistry set ever! Your brain. Yes, helping out spikes your feel good chemicals. It’s addictive. So don’t be an “inmate.”
