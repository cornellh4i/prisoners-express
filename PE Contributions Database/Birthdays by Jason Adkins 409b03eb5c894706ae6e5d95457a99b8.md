**“Birthdays” by Jason Adkins**

Her birthday is always a solemn day for me. Until that day comes, I seldom think about it. Then it arrives and I spend as much of my day in solitude as I can. Although no one knows it and sometimes, like today, when my job gets in the way, my goal of solemnly sitting in solitude seems impossible.

However, my focus remains on her, what she lost. Every year the number increases by one. Last year on this day she would have turned twelve years old. To me, that means twelve years lost. This year she would have been thirteen. Gone are her teenage dreams. With each new number comes new sorrow for all the “could haves” and “would haves” over the birthdays that she should have.

I grew up thinking that I was going to be such a good father, you know, “the father that I never had.” Now I let the magnitude of her loss beat me down. I don’t try to stop it. Once, a year, for one day, I choose to dwell and wonder. I mourn the death of my daughter and debate her meaning, but it can only last for a day, for there are no acceptable answers. Plus, if I lived in such a way, everyday, I would be paralyzed by the pain. It would lead to a loss of relationships, responsibilities, and my resolve. As mysterious and seemingly meaningless as the loss of Breanna’s life was, I have to find ways to live so it won’t be in vain. This means cultivating the relationships in my life where love grows. This does not mean I’ve overcome anything or become stronger in any way. I’ve just found that there is a certain amount of suffering in life you must learn to live with. Though I may no longer be bleeding from the wounds of losing my daughter, I am scarred. Scars never go away.
