**“The Prison Railway” by Kevin Murphy**

There are many directions one’s life can go, and once set upon one of them, there are many ways to go in that direction.

At this time of my life I’ve set myself upon a set of tracks leading to only God knows where. They’re laid out before me, but fade into a mist in the distance. They lead in a direction that I’ve no choice but to follow.

Looking back on the tracks I’ve been on, there are many junctions that I’ve taken that have placed me on the set before me. Each junction, a choice that I’ve made or that has been made for me. The tracks before me, the ones I call the Prison Railway, are laid out in a straight line and while I must follow them wherever they go. I’m learning that there are different ways for me to travel down this line. There are junctions that will lead me down different pants, even as they follow the same railway.

The easiest way is to follow the straight path, the old line, to go with the flow. To become a part of the environment, conform to the prison way of life, become a prisoner, learn to talk the talk, walk the walk, live the prison life, the prison lifestyle.

That’s the easiest way, it takes the least amount of work, but this isn’t the way that I’ve chosen to travel. The way that I’ve chosen is a different way. It isn’t conformity, it isn’t following the norm, and it isn’t the easiest way. The way that I’ve chosen is a way that betters me mentally, a way that will change me on the inside. It’s a way that will make me a better person, a better father, son, and husband. It’s a way that will strengthen my mind and spirit.

Following the path that I’ve chosen isn’t the easiest way, not in a world where the strong prey on the weak. A world where prison rules have been in place for decades to protect the hard-core prisoner’s way of life.

As I travel down the tracks laid before me, I spend my time reading and writing. I’m not the best at either, but I learn something new each day in hopes that one day I’ll be great at them. I write my story, sharing with those who’ll listen to what life is like for me, a prisoner who doesn’t want to be.

The tracks are laid out before me, the distance shrouded in mist. I don’t know where they go, only that they do and I must follow them. My only comfort is knowing that I still have some control of how I travel down them, the tracks I call the Prison Railway.
