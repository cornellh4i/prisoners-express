**Blink of an Eye By Matthew Tomlinson**

You’ve said it yourself. “I can just see that. I can see it in my Mind’s Eye.” You need an introduction to Mind’s Eye so that you will truly know what it’s all about. You actually can see much more with your Mind’s Eye than you can with your green eyes (or brown, or blue, or black, as it suits you).

There’s a book called The Dedalus Book of Spanish Fantasy. It’s translated by Margaret Jull Costa and Annella McDermott. THe collection is distributed in America by Subterranean Company, Post Office Box 160, Monroe, Oregon 97456, it says. On page 77 begins the short story “Beyond Death” by Spanish author NOel Claraso. It’s introduced by this unattributed quotation: “It is very hard to know what wea are, but the problem does not end there; there is also what we were before and what we will be afterwards.” Extensively documenting my source acquits me of plagiarism. Yet back in 1948, when both of my parents were preschoolers, “Beyond Death” was published so Claraso could document Mind’s Eye.

The story goes like this. Felipe and Eulalia, newlyweds, travel to the Salarda, in the Sierra Morena mountains of southern Spain. They stay in a mountainside inn. Felipe leaves at dawn to climb treacherous Mount Beciberri: the route takes 7 hours up and 5 hours back down. Felipe hasn’t returned by nightfall. A search party leaves Salarda at 0200 hours. Eulalia feels a presence in the room. The ghost of Felipe tells his new bride that he died in a fall, that he’s come to tell her goodbye, but that Eulalia should always wait because Felipe will return one day. That’s Mind’s Eye. Eulalia saw the dead Felipe with her Mind’s Eye.

The story verifies that Felipe did return to Eulalia. Twenty years later Felipe returned to the body of Evaristo. Evaristo is identical to Felipe, although the daughter never knew Felipe since he died just after conceiving his daughter. Evaristo was courting the daughter. The story ended in a swift tragedy. (Far be it from me to spoil the ending for you.)

The story concerns “vague recollections of a life he [Evaristo] had never had”. But Evaristo is a medical student so he “knows there are many dark wells in the life of the spirit whose depths can never be plumbed”. (page 92) These recollections Evaristo had are a form of Mind’s Eye.

We come now to how the story relates to my story. Mind’s Eye is the connection.

Abbey Red sits in the dining room of The Shack there in northern Houston. SHe excuses herself a moment. Tee Dee watchers her go into the hallway. He never hears her go into the bathroom. He attributes that to distance. He never hears her come out. She’s absent long enough that Tee Dee knows Abbey Red went up the hallway into his bedroom. Mind’s Eye pictures her as she enters. Maybe she searched the room. Maybe not. She brings a paperback lifted from the bedroom bookshelves. Mind’s Eye snaps a cerebral photo. Mind’s Eye then compares the photo to a years-old image. Tee Dee knows which book she has. Mind’s Eye told Tee Dee the book would be The Dedalus Book of Spanish Fantasy. Mind’s Eye saw it years ago.

“I’ve been looking for this book for years. May I borrow it?”

Tee Dee picks up the paperback. “Please accept it as a gift. Two pages fell out while I was in prison, but I marked that story so you’ll be warned. I hate getting into a good story but never finding out how it ends.” Tee Dee had an inkling how this story would end.

Abbey Red accepts the present. “Thank you. You aren’t mad that I went into your bedroom, are you? “

“I’d have been shocked if you didn’t. It’s what a woman does. It’s what a cop does. So I’d have been doubly shocked if you didn’t.” Mind’s Eye predicted it years before, So Tee Dee would’ve been mystified if it hadn’t happened.

“There’s one story here by Noel Claraso called ‘Beyond Death’. Do you believe in reincarnation?”

“Yes, but not the Hollywood myths. So what you’ve asked is whether the spirit of the dead Felipe could come back to Eulalia in the boyd of Evaristo? Certainly.” Tee Dee stopped abruptly. No need to tell Abbey Red that she herself had been seen by Mind’s Eye years before Tee Dee knew he’d be released from prison, There are a wide variety of details that the Department of Homeland Security had no need to know. Mind’s Eye was such a detail.

Abbey Red thumped the book softly on the table. “ You know I’m working on the Isabel Maria Valdez murder. Look, in the story Felipe comes back to tell Eulalia goodbye. “If.” Abbey Red paused. “If. If you… perceive anything, will you tell me?”

Tee Dee shrugs. “I was in prison that day.”

“Anything? WIll you tell me?”	“We’ll see.”
