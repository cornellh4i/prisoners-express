**Zoo by Shaun Blake**

Hogle Zoo is in Salt Lake City, UT. It’s the best zoo I’ve ever been to. I’ve only been to a couple zoos so my judgement might be flawed. Anyway, I’ve been to this zoo dozens of times and still enjoy it every time. I anticipate my next visit.

For now I’ll tell you about some favorite memories of my visits to Hogle Zoo. The first visit to the Hogle Zoo…

“Hey! Don’t run Shaun! Wendy!” Yelled mom. “The animals aren’t going anywhere.”

Acting as if we don’t hear, Wendy and I continue racing to the front gates–where we wait for everybody else so dad can pay the entry fee. Through the gates and to the left is a large fountain with a wide pool of water about two feet deep where people toss coins in, like a wishing-well. It looks to have at least two-three inches of coins covering the bottom of the pool. I sit on the rim and reach to grab a handful...SMAACK!

“Get your hand outta there!” Barks dad, with a whack to the head for emphasis.

Snatching back my hand, rubbing the back of my head, I look up seeing dad with a smirk on his face standing behind me stretching forth his hand to me. Taking his hand we start after the rest of the family. We then separate into groups heading out on the city dweller’s safari.

The first place my group views is a huge man-made cirque at the center of the main thoroughfare. Inside is a center area filled with intricate jungle-gym intermingled with dirt mounds, vegetation and rock formations; a wide moat-like trench around it; and then a steep concrete wall surrounding it all rising to the fence surrounding it all. We lean over the fence excitedly checking out the first chimpanzees we’ve ever seen. There's sixty-odd of them; male, female, babies. They’re involved in several different activities: feeding, grooming, playing, sitting looking at us watching them, begging food (there are signs all over informing us not to feed the animals except from designated vendor devices at each variation), and suddenly we see one peeing in the moat and another shitting in its hand then throwing it at a teasing watcher. This is the start of an educating day.

Hogle Zoo has a little train you can ride around on, as well as, an elephant with a blanket and basket-like seating contraption. They cost money and I’ve never rode either.

The penguin habitat has a sectioned off surface area with a large pond and coastal area. The penguins awkwardly and funnily waddle around and then drive into the pond and streak away. There’s a stairway down to an underwater viewing window where you can watch the fluidity of the little creatures. I want to dive in and play with them. But right next to the penguins is my favoritest habitat: the otters, seals and dolphins . If I could be any animal it would be one of these. No more can be said.

The bear habitats are a cool: the shy pandas, the black and browns, grizzlies, and polar bears. One time the female polar bear had two cubs. Very interesting and funny! The boisterous cubs crawled over, bite ears and generally pestered mom, and each other, the whole time and their mom just lay there passively. I was jealous!

I love the cat-house. Here you find the lions, cheetahs, jaguars, cougars, leopards, etc., etc,...and tigers. Fear inspiring! Hogle Zoo used to have a unique creature–a Liger. Never heard of a liger? It’s a very rare cross between a lion and tiger. Seriously! I’m not sure if another one is out there somewhere but it’s a real creature. She had kinda whitish and black stripes and was really big. Mostly tigerish featured. I think its name was sheera or shasta or something. She Was really beautiful. Look it up. It’ll be worth it.

The aviary is wonderfully loud with many species. It holds a small finch and hummingbirds to large eagles and vultures to the nocturnal owls–hundreds of birds flying around in an artificial-natural habitat. One flying creature I didn’t expect to find here, but I did, is the Honeybee. There’s a large glass apiary where you watch the bees inside workings of the bees in action.

Another of my favorite habitats is for rodents: ground-squirrels,woodchucks, mice, prairie-dogs, etc… This is fun because part of the exhibit is a large “prairie-dog village” that humans can crawl around in “tunnels” leading to different “surface holes” and stick your head out like a prairie-dog.

An interesting story about the gorilla exhibit. At one time a female (I think) kinda adopted a domestic kitten. It goes that a kitten shows-up in the gorillas habitat one day when the keepers tried to remove it, the gorilla wouldn’t let them. The last I heard it was still there.

There’ve habitats for llamas, deer (all kinds), wolves, giraffes, hippos, rhinos, elephants, reptiles, insects, snakes (do not tap the glass! I always tap), aquatic creatures, zebras, wildebeests, lemurs, lemmings, ant-eaters, etc…, and many more I’ve forgotten. It’s been over 20 years and I can’t wait to go again.

Lastly, when we leave the first time I went, as we trudge out of the main gate my dad and I stop at the wishing-fountain, each throwing in a quarter–wishing for a quick return. This is what the fountains for him told me. The funniest thing that day: As we walk to the car a big grayish-whitish blob of bird shit splats square onto my head and drips down my forehead. Dad laughs so hard he’s crying. Never seen anything like that from him before that day or since. I didn’t think it was so funny. But I’d take it anew if I could be at the zoo again.
