**Keeping Calm By James Bauhaus**

Keeping the youngsters calm in these tiny, 2-man, toilet-sized cages is a chore that I only have to perform once per person. These young punks all think that they are hot shit because their step-daddies ran away and they got to slap their mommas, then steal grandma’s car for a joyride before the cops caught them. They cried their eyes out to get a little two year sentence, fooling all these “smart on crime” geniuses for the 15th time. Each one of these little twerps have been gaming the system ever since they first learned how much joy they could get out of pulling the cat’s tail. Soon as they got here, they high five all their little-punk pals, race off to spend their mom’s money on scary tattoos, then go find some old or retarded guy to ratpack for his pills. It’s all one happy holiday for them, because they can do everything that they did on the streets, but better, because there are no cops in person to catch them and punish them for stealing, raping, ratpacking and doping.

The prison kops do have a thing that they call “writeups”. It’s supposed to be like a ticket, except, instead of paying money to the cops, they got their sentence extended. But it’s not like a ticket, unless the cops gave you money, and, every time they caught you speeding, they made you give some of it back. Also it’s not like a ticket because the cops don’t have any “smart on crime” politician-geniuses telling them to give the speeders all the money back just so they can ease “overcrowding” in their jails.

So! Since there are no cops in prison, and the pretend-cops that they do have can only vend pretend-punishment, it’s up to us adults to slap the gang-punks in line.

A good example is the one in my cage that the state is forcing me to babysit now. The previous one was Heat Wave. He got the hell out fast, soon as he learned that I don’t allow a bunch of idiots to crowd into my cage to watch him cribble permanent graffiti; on the skin of other numbskulls who think self-mutilation is art. The one that I got in exchange when Heat Wave escaped is Hood. Hood is almost 40 years old, with the mind of a teenager. The cops tore him out of his Mother’s basement, where he stayed with his dogs, which he petted and played with, and which his Mother fed, watered and cleaned-up after. Hood tries to sleep/daydream in the upper rack 24/7, intending to just wake up and walk out next november. He always faces the door, which tells me all I need to know about his crime. The state helps keep him, and all the other punks, calm by giving them tranquilizers. All they have to do is go visit the nut doctor, for free, say the magic words, “I can’t sleep,” and he will generously prescribe free pills that keep them from wishing that they had the guts to commit suicide.

These youngsters guzzle coffee when even the drugs can’t force them to sleep/daydream anymore. One of the pnks did more dope than his Mom could pay for. He got scared then pulled and escape-move by snitching off all of his friends, telling his guard-pals “These gangstas are trying to kill me!” This got everyone locked up. Hood, too sore from lying on his ass for weeks, had to get up and guzzle coffee. His nut-doctor medicine stopped affecting him. He couldn’t stand reading and the quiet of me working and not watching my television. He couldn’t zone-out to his radio anymore. His cunning little twerp mind schemed-up a plan to make let him watch my TV. He thought to himself, “This old far will cower, as soon as I go into my tantrum routine that always works on Mom.”

Instead of TV, I told him about others like him, who couldn’t keep calm: Truman Trobridge; beat to death with a mop wringer, for getting sassy with a guy who was not big and tough, but was sneaky. Albert McDonald, stabbed to death with a spoon-handle for being Kop’s kiss-up. And on and on, even though that now, the kops have cameras everywhere. Hood learned quickly that he was just another whiny little punk who, if he wanted to leave prison alive, he should shut his noise-hole and practice how to keep calm.
