**"Practical Joke" by Chadwick Keoni Majamay**

Practical jokes has been an all time favorite past time of my childhood, and this story is the biggest of them all.

It is a sunny, 65 degree Christmas Day in Hilo, my hometown. As usual, I am playing with the new toy I got for Christmas, an IBM ThinkPad 380XD. It’s my 13th Christmas Present. After my dad set up his new Compaq Presario, I went on it, and on the screen was dad’s e-mail account. I emailed my aunt in Barbados to invite them over for New Years'. Lo and behold, my dad gets a call from my aunt at New Year's Day from my aunt at the airport!

I was grounded for a year without my IBM Laptop! Damn! Oh? And did I mention that my aunt and dad are the worst of enemies? And my aunt loves torturing my dad. Poor dad...
