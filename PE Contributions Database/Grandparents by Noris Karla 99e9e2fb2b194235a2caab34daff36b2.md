Grandparents by Noris Karla

I think about my grandparents all the time when I am on my bunk. I think about how I would go on nature walks with my grandma when I was little, or how my grandpa used to always tease me by saying “What Lola wants Lola gets” because I am very spoiled and because there was a song with those words in the lyrics. When I would visit during the summer as a child, they always made sure there was pan dulce, including my favorite pumpkin empanadas. My grandparents loved each other, their family, and giving back to the church. My grandma loved to cook and grandpa would always have hot sauce on everything he ate. They were married 66 years and 2 months. In May 2014, when my grandpa got sick and passed away with grandma and family at his bedside, I sat in prison. However, God gave me my closure. It was so strange how it occurred. I got to talk to my mom who flew down to Edinburg, Texas to be with her parents. She let me know ahead of time what to expect. I even got to talk to my grandpa a few times a few days before he went to heaven. The reason I say heaven is because the day he died, I had to go to Restaurant Management Vocational. We sometimes get to cook. That day, Mrs. Maxwell, the teacher, said, “Today, we are making pumpkin empanadas.” I knew that at that moment this was God’s way of letting my grandpa say good-bye to me. Well sure enough, when I got back to the dorm, my mom and dad let me know Grandpa had peacefully passed away. I, of course, cried, but I knew he was with God in heaven. I didn’t get a furlough. I think it was for the best because I don’t think I could have handled being at my grandfather’s funeral and then coming back behind the razor wire.

Now, I just have my loving grandma to whom I still write and send cards. Every now and again, I have a dream about my grandpa, and he is is always telling me know much he loves my grandma and how he is watching over her and is still with her. He was an amazing, humble man who loved his family. He had a big heart for helping people, made jokes, and loved drinking coffee with his friends. He was always smiling and just thinking about him makes me smile too.
