**“Music, A (paint-peeled) Door…& Self by Terry Lytle**

And I will rise. Rise… just as the Phoenix son that I am - disintegrated stress like the flesh that peels off my skin… ashes… dust… consumed by the fire of all things seen, that I’ll never be…

Rise… like a double helix saluting the Creator… right wing, raised… shapening: like a flame in a consuming fire… eating oxygen, as words eat space of a page....

And I stand, as double Phoenixes face each other across the schism of the clear, squared glass… looking into ether, disregarding the bars… the guards…

Not that you were ever beneath me… just lower than I’m willing to go… Chance, the separation between you, and bad luck… that’ll place your world behind steel doors…

And yet, you still beg for more.. Integrity - the luck forgotten

As I am risen… Begotten by the flames of desire - fires, of lives I’ve lived… human characteristics, sacrificed like the wood fueling the pyre of my hands…

Pages of a book…

Guns drawn, like a Cowboy in the strife life - of the night light, ten places out to a gunfight that his intellect has him drawing at eight… shooting at nine… congratulating himself, at ten…

Phoenix from the fire, on mainframe… “The Pen” doing the math… This, is twelve… Learn… discern… as the fire only burns, consumable waste - deaths ridiculous agony: bland in its taste…

As the sunset horizon paints the sky hues of blood within veins and bones of an angel, manifested form… within the blue-grey norm of my prison’s door...
