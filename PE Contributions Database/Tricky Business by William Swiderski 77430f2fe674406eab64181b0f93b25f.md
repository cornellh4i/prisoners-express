**Tricky Business by William Swiderski**

Living in prison can be a tricky business. So many different personalities to deal with every day. Never knowing who is in a bad mood. Always trying to avoid the negative vibes. Sometimes just saying ‘what’s up’ can lead to trouble.

I try to look and see who’s got a smile on their face and I try to keep one on mine. That’s a good start. Although after 35 years in prison I’ve seen some crazy stuff going on. But I walk on with a smile on my face and I’ve guarded it all. Hopefully one day I’ll be back on the other side of the wall and I’ll probably still be walking and smiling. I guess living on either side of the wall is a tricky business.
