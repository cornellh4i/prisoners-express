**Rescued by Marvin Jones**

A beautiful little girl is born, at the time of her birth her father is incarcerated, but upon the news of her birth he is overcome with joy and tears.

When he gets out of jail his baby girl is only a year and half old… he sees her in the hospital because before he gets out her drunken aunt who happens to be carrying her slips on some ice and falls on his baby girl breaking her thigh bone. So standing there in the hospital room looking down at his beautiful baby girl he blames himself for not being there to protect her, to rescue her from her drunk aunt. Again teats flow from his eyes.

As the years go on, life happens… He divorces the mom and moves on, not knowing the damage this decision will have on his baby girl’s life! Living in another state and back in prison he finds out his beautiful baby who is now 15 was raped by her mother’s boyfriend at the age of 12 until she turned 15. The news devastated him, he wanted to mutilate and kill this bastard … as he stood there reading the news he could barely make out the words because of the tears streaming down his face, and again he blamed himself saying he should have been there for his babygirl.

Flash forward 15 years, this father now in prison doing a life bid gets a message on 7/7/20 gets a message from home that his baby girl has overdosed, she’s gone FOREVER!!! Once the shock wore off he found he couldn’t speak, only scream and yell and cry. He feels if he had made the right choices in his life for his baby girl he could have rescued her, but instead he cries at her death, but not with the joy he did at her birth.

Rest in Peace

PS

To all you Mothers and Fathers, being incarcerated shouldn’t stop you from reaching out to your children, regardless of whether they don’t want to talk to you or not, God forbid something happens to them, you don’t want this guilt eating you up on the inside that you might have been able to save them. All you can do is plant the seed in their minds and let God do the rest.
