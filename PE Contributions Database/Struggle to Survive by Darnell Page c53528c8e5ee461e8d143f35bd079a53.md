**"Struggle to Survive" by Darnell Page**

Hello, my name is Yin-yin and I am from a small village in North Vietnam. I was blessed to be taught how to read and write by an American teacher who was part of a group helping to teach my people to read and write so that we might begin to rise from poverty. Sadly, they had to leave in the middle of the night about two weeks ago because rebel drug soldiers were taking over our rice paddies to expand their territory.

All who refused to work for them are immediately executed. Instead of staying and becoming slaves to the evil drug lords or dying, what was left of my family and village decided to flee from the drug wars once again. At only twelve years of age I have lost my mother, father, and older brother because of the fighting. I do not know how much longer my grandmother can go on like this. Already we have fled six times in the last ten months. It seems like we can never run far enough to escape the evils around us. My grandmother is too old to keep running away, but her strength gives me the strength to carry on.

I know it takes a toll on her each time we have to leave and start over. As soon as we find another plot of land to plant our rice shoots, we must flee for our lives once more. It is not fair. Why do bad people have all the money they want without ever knowing a hard day’s work, while the honest-hearted and poor struggle to survive? Why are the poor constantly oppressed while the rich are never held accountable for their actions?

Each time I think about it it hurts my heart and brings tears to my eyes. All of my friends are either dead or have been taken by the bad men who go village to village looking for young girls to sell. So far I have been lucky to escape, yet for how long I cannot say. Maybe I will live long enough to meet a boy from and different village and start a family of my own. Someday. Or maybe not. Countless nights I dream of visiting America so I can go to an amusement park and eat cotton candy or an American chocolate bar, or ride a roller coaster. I know it will never come true because I still struggle to survive.

There is much more I wish to write, but I must go now since this is my last sheet of paper and the drug soldiers are very near to finding us. Oh how I wish my life could have been different. Just know this: as long as I live I will continue to struggle to survive until my dreams come true.

[Note to reader: Shortly after Yin-yin wrote this letter, the group of refugees she was with was captured by rebel soldiers and she was carried off to be sold on the black market, while everyone else was shot and left for dead. Yin-yin’s grandmother lived long enough to be discovered by American forces and told them what happened. They are still searching for Yin-yin, although with each day that passes, all hopes of finding her grow smaller.
