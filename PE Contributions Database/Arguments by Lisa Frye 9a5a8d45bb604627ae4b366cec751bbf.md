**Arguments by Lisa Frye**

Man, what a word, who can argue with arguments? My ex can, that’s who. Anything and everything you tell him does not exist, isn’t real, is untrue, or is your fault. I once told him he is the master debater and should work as the President’s Advocate because he could win every debate and get paid top dollar for it.

The arguments we have been through together have left lasting scars on my heart, mind, soul, and spirit. Let’s just say the years have ground me down with words. Words of judgement, criticism, hatred, and blame. But, he would argue and say it didn’t happen or it was all done in the name of love. Arguments rob you of integrity, honesty, kindness, and love, because one always feels right, so the other must be wrong no matter what the cost. Heartache, heartbreak, lies, shame, blame, and unforgiveness. These arguments take their toll, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and mentally. Sometimes it may be best to just agree to disagree. Being “right” isn’t worth the cost to someone else’s soul to me. You have the right to be you and I’m Freda Bee Me.
