**“My Parents” by Paul Brandeth**

I grew up in a single family home in a quiet suburban neighborhood just outside of Queens, N.Y. My mother was a nurse and my father was a sergeant for the NYPD. I also had a younger brother named Keith who was 5 years younger than me.

Both of my parents were providers and I can honestly say that looking back over the years, we never went without. There was always good on the table, at least at the start of the meal, but if the steak of roast beef was cooked a little too much, it wound up in the street. I always had shoes on my feet that fit and a warm coat in the winter time. And at Christmas, there was always a new bike of a favorite toy under the tree. I guess looking in from the outside, we were your stereotypical blue collar middle class family.

But growing up, I could sense there was something different. I never had a birthday party and there was no bringing friends home after school. We did go to family gatherings, but always on my mom’s side, and usually dad didn't attend or made an early exit. I can remember meeting my dad’s mom only once and visiting his father maybe once a year and he only lived in the Bronx. I never met any aunts, uncles, or cousins on his side. He did have a brother named Paul and from what I was told, they had a fight when they were younger and never talked again. One day the phone rang. It was a woman claiming to be my aunt, my uncle Paul’s wife. She said he was dying of cancer and only had a few months to live and he wanted to make amends. My father wouldn’t get on the phone.

His name was Artie and he was a strict disciplinarian. He was more of a cop than a father and there was never any outward expressions of love or affection. To be honest with you, it was just the opposite and his punishments were brutal. I was only a child yet he beat me like a grown man. It could have been for walking in front of the TV while he was watching the news or not getting 100% on a test in school. Sometimes my mom worked the night shift and I remember crying, begging her, “Please, don’t go, don’t leave us.” It was pure torture and it felt like the night would never end.

I feel that no child should ever fear their own parents, and if you don’t feel safe in your own home, where can you go? Can you believe I used to dread the 3 o’clock bell signalling the end of the school day?b Because I never knew what waited for me when I got home.

Fast forward a few years and my mom decided she needed to leave. She couldn’t take the abuse and his constant belittling and humiliation became too much for her. I realize not that it was a hard decision to make, but she still had two sons she was leaving behind with a violent ex-drunk, it would only get worse. He went to AA and was sober for years, but became more angry and violent.

As I got older and into my teens, I started working out. I played high school football and lifted weights so now the beatings stopped and the verbal abuse started. Funny thing though: an ass whoopin lasts a few minutes, those words scar for life. Now Keith took the brunt of the abuse and I protected him as best I could. One night, I was in my room doing homework and I could hear my father berating Keith and him apologizing, but he wouldn’t stop. Finally I couldn’t take it anymore and I came out of the room and threw him in the corner and jacked him up. “Let’s go, me and you, right now!” I told him, “Everyday I’m getting bigger and stronger and you’re getting older and weaker.” He didn’t do anything. He didn’t want to fight me, but then, later on he came into the living room with his gun and said, “You have one weakness, you can’t sleep with one eye open. I won’t use my hands on you anymore and I Won't use that bat, I’ll put five in your fucking head while you’re sleeping.” Now you tell me what kind of father tells his son that?

I can remember being little, 8 or 9 years old and asking God, “Please let my father get shot tonight at work.” I can recall standing over him with a knife early in the morning while he was passed out on the couch, trying to talk myself into stabbing him. To this day I tell my mom I regret not killing him back then.

My mom managed to get her marriage annulled by the catholic church and then went into the convent and became a nun with the sisters of Carmelites. She was Sister Dorothy Teresa. Keith died of an accidental overdose, oxycontin. We buried him on 911 and on the way to the church, the planes hit the towers. One year later on SEptember 18th, the feds kicked in my door and arrested me. A few years later, in october ‘05, my father died of a heart attack. He was all alone in his house, just him and his dog. If it weren’t for his neighbor noticing that he hadn’t taken in the trash can for a few days and notifying the sheriff, he’d still be there.

I hadn’t spoken to Sister Dorothy Teresa for quite a few years until I saw her at Keith’s funeral and then not a single word for 7 years after stemming from an argument of some of the arrangements her and her sister made concerning the wake and burial. Keith was not only my brother, he was my best friend. Not only that, he and my dad were actually very close now. So when she refused to compromise with me about two minor details that mean a lot to me, I chased her and her family from the cemetery.

On December 15, 2005, I was extradited from my federal prison in Louisiana back to Miami, Florida where I was indicted for 1st degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. I was also informed that the state was seeking death. When the state charges you with the death penalty, they assign you a special lawyer who is death qualified and his sole job is to keep you alive if you love trial. He handles the penalty phase. He hires investigators to dig up your past from the day you were born looking for mitigating factors to help keep you alive.

These investigators found my mom. She had left the convent and was taking care of my grandmother who was getting old and suffering from dementia. She had no idea what was going on with me. Then one day in 2007, I received a birthday card. It said, “Dear Paul, the day I buried your brother I felt like I lost both my sons. You are all I have left. You father is dead. Your brother is dead. I’m all you have left.” It went on and on about how I didn’t let her grieve at her own son’s funeral and the pains of burying a son.

I wrote my mom a letter apologizing for my actions explaining that I handled things poorly, but I tried to compromise with her and she wouldn’t budge. And don’t you know, my mom flew down for the trial and sat right behind me everyday. Even after hearing some bad things during some of the testimony, the only thing she said to me was, “Your friends aren’t very nice.”

We won! At least in my eyes we won. We hung the jury, 6 to 6, deadlock! The state had no case, just a bunch of liars given deals to shorten their time so they decided not to retry me. I took 20 years to run concurrently with my fed time and get out in about a year. I was given a special visit with my mom during the trial and I asked her, “Why didn’t you ever do anything?” At first she said, “You and your brother were so beautiful, blonde hair almost white, and blue eyes, that whew, I looked at you, I couldn’t believe anyone would hurt you.” I didn’t buy that. No way! She saw the bruises. She saw the blood. So I pressed harder.

A mother’s number one job is to protect her children. Most moms would die for their kids and then she told me,”I was afraid. I was terrified of him. He told me more than once he would kill me.”

I was okay with that answer and today we have a nice relationship. She visits me regularly and is my biggest supporter. She’s 72 years old and raising Keith's daughter. It makes me so happy to see the relationship they have and the bond they share.

We don’t get to choose our parents and some people are dealt a better hand than others. I know I’ve been through a lot and I’ve learned a lot. I thank God my mother is still alive and that I will get a chance to spend some time with ehr and give back to her a litte.
