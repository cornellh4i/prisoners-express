"Girl On Bench" by Craig Shipley

She was such a cool chick, and not at all bad-looking. Her name was Sara and she turned 23 the day this photo was taken. We went to the same school, we even had two of the same classes. Itâ€™s a shame that she is gone.

The tragedy occurred on a Saturday night. She was struck by a drunk driver in a pickup truck. He never saw her in the crosswalk, his foot never hit the brake, and she never saw it coming as he sped 90 miles per hour.

It was hard for me when I heard that Sara was gone. Such a beautiful person inside and out. Nobody like her deserved what she got, but who says life is fair? Wherever Sara is, I hope that she is well and that she knows how much I will always care.
