**Heavenly Redemption by Chad Dias**

On the Day of Judgement Allah will allow our hands to speak

Ayat 65 Surat 36

Maybe HE’ll permit our hands to cover our face,

As a reflexive gesture,

To hide a reformed sinners sense of disgrace.

Either way,

Our hands will testify to all the crimes they’ve committed

Ultimately leaving nothing omitted.

Sahih Al-Bukhari’s 6469th hadith

Has wording similar unto these;

“Allah divided his Mercy into one hundred parts.

One part HE dispensed evenly

Among the animals and mankind,

And withheld the additional ninety-nine.”

Hopefully that Mercy kept in reserve

Will serve as a means of reprieve

To relieve all the reformed sinners who will probably grieve

Because unexpectedly their sins could possibly be forgiven

In an act of Heavenly Redemption.
