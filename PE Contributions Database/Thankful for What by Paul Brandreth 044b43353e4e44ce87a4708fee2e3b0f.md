**Thankful For What**

When I started this journey just over 15 years ago, certain people told me I had so much to be thankful for. “Thankful for what?” I would say. I was younger, stubborn, a little hard headed and felt it got a raw deal. My plea was for 106 months, 8 years and 10 months. 46 months for the drugs, and 60 months to run consecutively for a gun I never touched, saw, or even knew existed. I turned the deal down and went to trial and was introduced to the federal judiciary system.

It took three years from start to finish, but in the end I was found guilty and sentenced to 235 months in maximum security federal penitentiary. Once again I would say, “Thankful for what?”

Just shortly after my sentencing I was charged on state court for 1st degree murder and conspiracy to commit 1st degree murder. I was also notified that the state was seeking death, and just like that, the life I once knew ceased to exist. I was placed in solitary confinement and the only contact I was allowed to have was with my attorney, and one more time I would say, “Thankful for what?”

I caught my case on South Beach back in 2002. I lived in a 5,900 square foot, $2,500,000 waterfront mansion. I drove $80,000 cars. I was out VIP every single night. Now my home is an 8’x10’ ft cement box. Again, I will ask, “Thankful for what?”

I was charged for the murder along with three other people. They agreed to testify against me for less time. “Thankful for what?”

I finally broke down and called on the one person I knew would help, who could help. So that night, I got down on my knees and I prayed for the first time in a very long time. I asked him to forgive me for life. I was living the last few years. I asked him to help me peel my jury and to reveal all the lies and he did. We hung the jury, 6-6. I beat death and beat life in prison. Thank you!!

Throughout these 15 years, I have never gone without. I have found out who my real friends are. Guys I grew up with, went to school with, played with, reached out to me and have stayed in touch, and have helped me out. My relationship with my mom which was non- existent when I got arrested has grown and flourished throughout years. My health is great.

I have about a year to go before I am released. I have seen a lot of death and violence throughout the years, and yet, I am okay. I am safe. I am healthy. I am alive. I am thankful !!
