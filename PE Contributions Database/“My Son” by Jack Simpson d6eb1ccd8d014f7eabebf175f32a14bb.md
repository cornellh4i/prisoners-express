**“My Son” by Jack Simpson**

I know you all have heard the tale of how this baby or that one is so precious. Until you have your own, it is true. I am proud to say that I was blessed with one each. A beautiful daughter and a handsome son. This story is about him. His nickname is Scooter.

All children will cling to their mother more than their father in most cases. The reason I know this is because I have lived it. I worked all the time and when you are away from your children it happens to be that way. Their mother was with them from sun up to sun down. That would be until I came in from work.

When I tried to get him to let me hold him, he would lean back against his mother with a funny looking face. I don’t know if any of you have ever seen the show about the dinosaurs. The one where the baby is always waking the father in the head saying “Not the moma”. If you have then you will understand.

Scooter was always into something. The terrible twos are a real trying time for children. It would be nice if they would just be able to skip that year. One afternoon I was sitting in the kitchen. Shelly and Scooter were playing in the living room. They were too quiet and that caught my attention.

She was watching him trying to place a paper-clip in the wall socket. I heard her say “do it.” Over and over. That really caught my attention. That was the day I was very upset. I asked her if she was trying to kill her brother. She just looked at me as if I was a stranger and she did not understand. That far away look in her eyes told me she was not in control.

I asked her,

“Who told you to do that?” She replied it was Trixie.

Lucky that I was watching them and from that day on they played where one of us could see them all the time. The next day Scooter was in the kitchen and didn't know what he had done. His mother was dead on his heels. They made it around the coffee table before he ended up in my lap. It’s alright Scooter, daddy will protect you. From that day on when he got tired he would come to me and lay his head on my chest. Soon he would be snoring. He never called me daddy or pop. He never called me by my name. So I accepted the fact he knew who I was.

One day my sister and I were getting ready to go to work. We both worked the second shift in the local cotton-mill. We were in the car and had fired it up when she told me that Scooter was crying and saying something. He was saying,

“My daddy! My daddy!” I shut the car off and ran back to the house to see what was going on with him. I opened the storm door and he was crying with real tears streaming down his little cheeks. I picked him up and asked what was wrong. He was still crying when he locked his arms around my neck. I had to explain in a way that he would understand that I had to make money in order to put food in his belly. As I goosed his belly, he began to laugh and soon was in his mother’s arms. We were soon on our way to work.

The next morning the two of them were standing beside the bed. I looked as if I didn’t see either one. Then without warning I said “BOO”! They both jumped and laughed. It didn’t take long once everyone was in bed that we were fast asleep. Scooter was holding my arm, while his sister was snuggled up close to her mother. Both of my children are very important to me. My son still will let me call him Scooter when I have the chance to talk to him. He may be in his forties now, but he is still my Scooter.
