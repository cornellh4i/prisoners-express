I wanted more than “God will see you through”

I wanted home desperately. The wolf was at the door. Maybe the Holy Spirit guided her response

I don’t know if she had a dream, vision or “word from the Lord.” We know she had a strong faith, conviction.

Here’s another problem.

Mail is great; thanks to all who stay in touch.

Here was a theme I noticed, “Wish there was something I could do. But we’re praying for you.”

It takes faith. Prayer in faith is doing something great!

Make note: rise above that mentality.

Keep the faith.
