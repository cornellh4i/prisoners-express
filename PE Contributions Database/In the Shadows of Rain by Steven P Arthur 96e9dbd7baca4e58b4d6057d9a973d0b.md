***In the Shadows of Rain* by Steven P. Arthur**

****Susan Ramey stood underneath her umbrella, sheltered from the rain, while a raging black storm grew inside of her. “Where is he?” she thought to herself.

Standing outside of the Safora’s fine Egyptian dining for the past hour, she knew something wasn’t right. Robert was never late. Susan contemplated leaving because they had already missed their reservation. Safora had a dining waiting list that ran into the next year. If you’re 5 minutes late, you can count on eating at the Burger King around the corner.

When the yellow cab pulled up, splashing dirty water from the curb onto her pant legs, she could see Robert moving around in the back. “Sorry I’m late. Traffic accident on I-95 had us at a stand still.” He leaned in for a kiss that she avoided.

“I don’t want to hear it,” Susan said as she turned and walked south. Robert let her walk away for about a city block. He was confused about her reaction but needed to talk to her. He couldn’t just let her walk away mad, so he chased after her and caught her at the crosswalk before the light change.

“Hey, what’s wrong? You’re over-reacting. We can eat at Cho Lings; you love their spring rolls.”

“This was supposed to be a special lunch, Robert. I had this planned out for two months,” she said.

“Honey,” he said as he hugged her close, “anytime and every meal is special with you.”

“You’re so corny.” She sniffed into his wool coat. “And what are you thinking, wearing wool in the rain? You smell like a wet dog!” He was always able to bring her moods around. The medication helped, but he was the best cure for a dark mood.

“I want to tell you something. And since we can’t sit down at Safora and enjoy an over-priced lunch first, I’ll tell you here in the shadow of the rain.”

“You’re so poetic,” he laughed. “What is it”

“I’m pregnant.” She stared at him, waiting for a reaction. His face was unreadable, then he began laughing hysterically. As she stood there, her initial irritation began to creep back.

When he reached into his pocked and pulled out a little, black velvet covered box, he revealed, “This is why I was really late.” He opened up a little box which on top, read “Tiffany’s” on and on bottom, sat the symbol of his love and devotion for her and their soon-to-be family.
