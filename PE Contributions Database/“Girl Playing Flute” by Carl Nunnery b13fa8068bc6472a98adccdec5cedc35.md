**“Girl Playing Flute” by Carl Nunnery**

We all have different opinions of how music sounds to us: some enjoy it very much, some may find the sound very annoying.

I’m sure you can remember when you or one of your children came up with the idea that they wanted to learn how to play some kind of musical instrument.

At first we thought it was a good idea, but as we began to hear some of the notes coming out of that instrument, it sounded as if it would strip the bark off trees! It was soon recommended we play at the back of the property so we didn’t disturb those who could hear it!

When we are playing music or learning to do so, this actually pleases the Lord; we are doing something God gave us a talent to do and we are not wasting our God- given talent. What others might hear as being painful to listen to, God sees differently! In (Psalms 100:1) it says, “Make a joyful noise to the lord.”

In Biblical times, music was played for many reasons such as “formal worship” (Gen 31:27) or as “religious ceremony” (2nd Chr 5:1). Those who played music were called “minstrel” which means “music maker.” If we look at (Matt 9:23) it says, “Jesus came into the rules house and saw the minstrel and the people making noise!”

When music was played in worship, the prophets sometimes used music to induce trance or possession by God’s spirit (supernatural power).

Whether you play music to the Lord or for the enjoyment of it, or even for others who enjoy listening to you play!

Remember this, many are not blessed with this talent of music makers, but you were given other useful talents that you may use for the glory of God.

God gives those who play musical instruments to be music to our ears and put joy in our hearts.
