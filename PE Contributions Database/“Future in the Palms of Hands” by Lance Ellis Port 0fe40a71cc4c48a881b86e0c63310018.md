**“Future in the Palms of Hands” by Lance Ellis Porter**

I hold in my hands a great responsibility. Where these little feet go in life are influenced by my examples. There is nothing close to magical as the creation of a new book. When we look to the future for the betterment of humankind, maybe, we should be less concerned with technology and be more nourishing to the creation of a new being. It will fall to them after all how far human beings will progress. I think too much is dependent on quicker, easier ways to do things and less on the quality of life. As far as I can see, we already have the greatest creation. It is the ability to reproduce and shape a better being.
