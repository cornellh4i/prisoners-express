**The Road by Catherine Lafleur**

Rachel is a close friend from childhood. As a child her family was in a horrible car crash. Her father died, her mother was crippled for life, and Rachel suffered multiple broken bones and a ruptured uterus. She and I have been friends since our teens when we assigned nursery duty at a commune where we were both raised.

All girls 12 and older were required to learn how to take care of infants and children. At the age of 14, as Elder Sisters, we got assigned to take care of three younger girls in the communal children’s dorm we all lived in during the school week. Among the girls our age, it was popular to speculate about the number of children we would have. That was when Rachel told me she could never have children. This was indeed a difficult burden for a young woman to bear because our religion taught a mark of God’s favor was birthing many children.

After my arrest, too many things happened so quickly, years later it's still tangled. The result was I convinced my dying mother to let Rachel tak Nathan and Joel to Upper New York State. I wanted my boys as far away as possible from the destruction I had caused. And they were young enough, I hoped they would forget. Over the years Rachel would send me photos. Although I had her phone number, it was too painful to call on a regular basis. I had to stop because Nathan picked up the phone once. My heart was in my throat. Also hearing Nathan and Joel’s voices in the background, well, it made me cry too much. It was as much pleasure as pain.

The only choice was making Rachel their mother with no interference or confusion from me. I remember reading in a college text that children with an incarcerated parent have a high percentage rate of becoming incarcerated themselves. The thought that my boys could grow up without a dark cloud over them was too tempting. This made the decision for adoption easier. Still painful, but easier.

I knew Nathan and Joel would eventually discover their adoption. At age 18, each child in my mother’s family gets to draw on a scholarship trust. I suspected I might be seeing either Nathan or Joel as men in some hazy, far distant future. I wrote a series of letters in two journals, one for each of my sons. They were full of explanation, family history, everything I could remember about their early childhood. Nathan used to love blue trucks, except he couldn't get out the “Tr” sound and instead replaced it for the “F” sound. He would babble on about his favorite topic, the blue “%uck”. Joel liked being a naked boy, he would scream if clothes were put over his diaper. He did consent to being wrapped in a blanket. Both my sons were very finicky eaters. I discovered the trick to it all. They would eat anything with goldfish crackers as an ingredient. Vegetables, fruit, any dish as long as it had identifiable goldfish, the boys would chow down. The journals filled up over the years.

Then, one hot July day Captain Bracey showed up in my dorm and told me to walk with her. We ended up in her office at which I realized she had personally retrieved me. This is never a good thing. She asked me if I needed to be cuffed because there was bad news. I assured her I was alright but my stomach was in knots. Cold sweat broke out all over my body.

Uncle Dirk came on the phone to tell me that Rachel picked up my sons from camp the previous week. On the drive back home to Rhinebeck, they were killed by a drunk driver. So that is it. I still have the journals. Can’t bring myself to do anything with them.
