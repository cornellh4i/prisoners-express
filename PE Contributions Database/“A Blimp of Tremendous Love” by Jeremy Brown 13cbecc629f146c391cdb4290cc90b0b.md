**“A Blimp of Tremendous Love” by Jeremy Brown**

“My dear lady do not worry yourself we will not get caught. For we have committed the crime of the 19th century. Our names will be heard long and far. We have stolen The Russian Blimp which is carrying Warheads to America. Just think of how many lives we have saved. This is my last good deed before I die my dear. For I meant to tell you I have a lecherous cancer that is eating my brain and perhaps my very own soul. It is the cancer of diss-ease with the world with preconditioned Society in general,” spoke Donald as he was steering the Blimp away from Washington D.C. to the coast.

“Oh Donald I do not wish for you to die. I love you so ever much,” spoke Melany, his mistress and partner in crime.

“Prove it to me darling right here right now on this very Blimp. Once we get about 20,000 feet and are cosating I want you to make love to me right here right now.”

“Oh Donald I promise I will never hold back me dear love for you.”

Melaney was a voluptuous redhead, a c cup for bosom. Just how Donald liked his women, wide hips, luscious and sensual lips and skin. Melaney loved Donald, not only did he have dark hair and dark eyes but it was his sense of Adventure, of going into the unknown realms of the Imagination and she loved conning people with him. She remembered him telling her about Marks and how there’s a new one born everyday, “After all Melaney the world works on money and it is up to us to extract it as smartly as possible without ever lifting a ginder. We are Masters of Deception, me and you Melaney, and what’s the point of having money if you can’t enjoy its rewards?” He was constantly reminding her of this but without her they wouldn’t be able to save anything he just kept spending it.

A Bird – a hawk of some sort – crashed into the siding bursting a small hole.

“Melaney we are losing altitude. I must fix and repair this hole. Steer clear of mountains; I trust you.” Donald climbed into the blimp, marveling at the warheads. They were going to drop in the ocean of course.

Using crude materials, glue, plastic and plaster, the blimp was repaired, although for how long was unsure.

“So Donald how’d it go babe?”

“Well it's holding, my love, at least for now. We don’t have much time.”

“Well if we are going to die saving all of those people, I want it to be Naked. Me on top, this time.”

“Very well, take it all off for me.”

Melaney took off her clothes. It was a bit cold and her breasts stiffened. Both Donald and Melaney were making love sweating even in the cold. So Beautiful was their love for one another, they did not realize how close to death they really were. The hole expanded and ripped open to enormous proportions; as they were crashing into the water, Donald and Melaney looked at one another in ecstasy, both were one and exploded into crystalized atoms as the war heads exploded above them. Both of their souls intertwined into one pure soul and as they were being judged by the Lady of Justice, She Goddess Justicia forgave both for their greedy dispositions.

“When both of you make love at the same time the war heads exploded in tandem with both of your love orgasms and created a Love Vortex that opened a way for the love energy of the universe to repair your fractured world. Your remains were found by the Coast Guard and Teddy Roosevelt held your names in high honor! Both of you are free to reincarnate or enjoy your oneness together on here The Astral Plane. What say you?”

“We shall remain in oneness lady of Justice. For we cannot bear to ever be apart again. We are soulmates forever more. It is only once in a great millenia two soulmates meet and become one with another.
