**“Giving a Helping Hand” by Dillon James Gresham**

Myself personally, I enjoy being able to help. It feels good helping somebody who needs help, and expects nothing in return. The feeling it creates is amazing and it’s my opinion that it works magic to a person’s self esteem. I know it does tricks for me. One day I may be having a bad day, and only negative thoughts rolling in my mind. Then I’ll roll across someone who needs help in anyway that I can help and for some reason, it feels like all the stress, pain, etc. I experienced that day, was all worth it.

My personal belief is that we all should be helping each other. As people of the struggle, it’s more or less all of our duty. Though there are many who don’t see eye to eye with this belief, I’d like to point out the fact, that we are all equal, we are all human, we might look different and in a sense none the same. However, in that same sense, we are the same in form that we all exist. Even so, there may be no two exactly alike; we are all human. Regardless of differences, it’s good to remember that we all need help sooner or later, and it’s best that the same way you’ll need help from somebody, that when somebody needs help, you aid and assist with no expectations.
