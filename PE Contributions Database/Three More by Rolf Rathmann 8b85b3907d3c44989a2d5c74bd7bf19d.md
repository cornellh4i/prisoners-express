**Three More by Rolf Rathmann**

Detective Esther Silvia had been on the force thirty-two years, and had never seen anything like this. “Griffith, found three more!”, she yelled to her partner in the other room. She replaced her gun back into its holster, as it was clear there was no imminent threat. Slumped before her were three twenty-something year olds, handsome, well-dressed men. Like the others they had found, they looked asleep. But she knew better. She picked up the wine goblet behind them, took a whiff and grimaced. Someone’s sons and brothers, she thought. What a loss.

Detective Leonid Griffith entered, wiping sweat from his brow. “Geeze, what’s this make it? Twenty-four and counting?”

“Let’s hope not, counting that is,” sighing, she continued, “But we have one more floor to search.” Plaintive dread colored their faces as they glanced upwards. Evidence technicians swarmed into the room, photographing the scene. With a latex-gloved hand, Esther gently lifted the chin of the one whose lustrous jet-black hair covered his face.

“Mi-Dio,” she whispered. She knelt down, looking at him as if she expected an answer. “Mijo, what happened?”

“You know him?”

She was silent for a moment, said a prayer in her native tongue, then arose with a slight groan. “This never gets easier, but this, yes, Leah’s boy. Whenever she worked overnights at the 7-Eleven, I, and many others on the block, took turns watching him. You know, the whole it-takes-a-village thing. Leah had a rough go of it, especially with this one, Ricky. He ran away at fifteen, never looking back. Eight months ago, shy of his twenty-third birthday, he phoned, saying he’d found a new way of life and was living with a family - ” Esther gestured around, “When Leah haltingly told me the name - Dawn of Starlight - well, no more words were necessary. As you know from our daily briefings, they feed on the vulnerable, a cult offering a better afterlife amongst the stars, planets, whatever.” She breathed out slowly.

“I’m so sorry,” Leonid reverently said. “Nothing they could do? Legally?”

“No, he was legally aged; they weren’t disruptive, no wild parties, lights out at 10, paid their bills. We weren’t sure how many lived here, I did some digging. They met all occupancy permits, and weren't running a for-profit. They appeared to be model citizens, private, no allegations of abuse, no one younger than twenty-one. Let me tell you, a storied history is behind this building. Built in 1880, it was a gift to the Mayor’s mistress. An open secret in town. His money kept her quiet, but couldn’t keep her from going insane. It’s rumored she hung herself, for all to see, from the outside portico, dressed in nothing but her lover’s distinctive top-coat - a final middle finger to the man she grew to hate.

Couple decades later, oil was discovered nearby, and this was renovated into a luxury hotel. Thirty-two beautiful rooms, stock market crashes, business dries up, and around 1935, this becomes a bordello, where it remained as such through the mid-fifties.

“It stayed in disrepair until the early eighties, when the Dawn of Starlight Ministries,” Esther loved her air quotes for that which she disdained, “Bought the building, renovated and took in the wayward and forlorn. Of course, JonesTown had taken place less than a decade previous, so they were ever mindful of their reputation, managing every aspect carefully, but - “

Transfixed, Leonid simply said, “But what?” The coroner had just placed Ricky in a body bag, the zipping an echo too loud to bear, as they stepped away, approaching the banister heading upstairs.

“Look, I’m Catholic, just putting it out there. I don’t believe in what I’m about to say, but it’s long been said that when the fog rolls in from the Valley, so does the ghost of that one mistress, crying because she cannot find her room or her lover, just floats through the hallways. I don’t know - “

Instinctively, Esther glanced at her Fitbit, morbidly interested in how many steps each investigation took. She shuddered as she noted: six hundred sixty-six steps. She crossed herself, then said, “Come we walk more,” as she drew her gun to take to the third floor.

“Are you all right?”

“I will be as soon as we walk more.”

They had been in the house for several hours; dusk was upon them, as was a light dewy fog, which clung low to the ground outside.
