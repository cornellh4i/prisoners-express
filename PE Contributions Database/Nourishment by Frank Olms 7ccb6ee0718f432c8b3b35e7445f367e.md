**Nourishment by Frank Olms**

Nourishment is a noun and defined as (2): the action or process of nourishing, which is an adjective and defined as: giving nourishment-- but nourishment to what? What is there in prison to nourish?

I saw one inmate doing pushups with another inmate sitting on his shoulders. He was nourishing his arm muscles with exercise, and then smoking the local substance known as TWACK-- a combination of dangerous substances that will kill you when you’ve had too much. It may stop your brain (the motherboard of man) from functioning which controls all the other body parts: like the lungs and heart… if one of them stops, so do you.

So I said to that man you are nourishing your muscles and killing your brain. You are becoming stronger than an ox but dumber than a box of rocks! He thought about the actions he was taking, and the road he was on to self destruction.

A couple days later, he quit smoking to concentrate on his muscles and health… A wise move.

Another man nourishes his brain by reading and writing and developing stories like the ones you are reading now. As muscles get bigger with exercise, so the brain expands mentally to accommodate a larger vocabulary, and a better use of punctuation to add suspense and intrigue and interest to the inditers creation.

I recently received an unsatisfactory report for my work performance. I contested the evaluation. How could I be rated unsatisfactory when the evaluator had not seen me move and therefore had no idea what I was doing! Maybe I was cogitating on this writing that doesn’t require a lot of physical movement. As a matter of fact, I can think about a lot of things and not even build up a sweat… Not like the bodybuilder with the inmate sitting on his shoulders while doing pushups!

All this thinking has made me hungry… I think I’ll have a bite of food and give my body some nourishment. Yeah--

P.S. the evaluator reconsidered and changed the rating to ABOVE satisfactory.
